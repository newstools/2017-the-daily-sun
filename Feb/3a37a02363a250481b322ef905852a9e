PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has repeated his commitment to return land to black people. Speaking yesterday in parliament during his response to the State of the Nation Address debate, Zuma said the process will be guided by the law.He said: &ldquo;White people should not feel as though conversations about land is inspired by hatred for whites.&ldquo;Many people who own the land now didn&rsquo;t buy it. &ldquo;The land problem must be resolved. All we want is to come up with a solution.&rdquo; The president&rsquo;s statement was in response to Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald who, during the debate, accused Zuma of hating white people and blaming them for all the country&rsquo;s problems.Zuma added that the radical economic transformation he spoke about during his address was not empty talk.&ldquo;Transformation is part of healing the wounds of the past. &ldquo;We are not going to be apologetic about economic freedom. &ldquo;Economic transformation must be radical and revolutionary.&rdquo;Zuma said black people cannot continue to be workers, but should also be business owners.&ldquo;We have it in our power to change South Africa&rsquo;s economy. &ldquo;That is the only way to achieve unity, prosperity and true reconciliation. &ldquo;We will continue to pursue this with enthusiasm.&rdquo; Zuma urged MPs to restore dignity and order to parliament.&ldquo;There are MPs who are treating the house worse than they treat a beerhall.&rdquo; Zuma also touched on the issue of education, saying government policies will respond to concerns raised by higher learning students in the coming months.&ldquo;Government will intensify efforts to ensure higher learning is accessible to the poor.&rdquo;
