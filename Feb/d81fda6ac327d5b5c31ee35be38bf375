A FEW residents celebrated in Snake Park, Soweto at the weekend. They said a sangoma, who used to beat and strip women wearing trousers, had been arrested.Yvonne Mmutlane (66) from Snake Park block 12 claimed for decades the sangoma healed the people who flocked to his house. But four years ago, he started behaving strangely.&ldquo;He wanted to attack me, even if I just greeted him. He didn&rsquo;t want to see a woman wearing trousers. &ldquo;He would chase that woman, beat her up and strip her naked if she could not fight for herself.&ldquo;People would run for their lives whenever they spotted the sangoma.&rdquo;Yvonne said she was at home last Monday when the sangoma started throwing stones at her house, breaking her windows.&ldquo;I was scared and thought he was going to beat me up.&rdquo; She said she and other gatvol residents called the cops, who arrested the sangoma and locked him up at Dobsonville cop shop. &ldquo;We were tired of his behaviour,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want that sangoma to come back to our community. &ldquo;We lived a life of fear and horror.&rdquo;Another neighbour, Bheki Mazibuko, said: &ldquo;He was a bad man. &ldquo;I opened two cases of assault and malicious damage to property because he beat me and also broke the windows of my house.&rdquo;Captain Kay Makhubele, Gauteng police spokesman, said police are investigating cases of malicious damage to property, assault and harassment. The suspect is still in police custody.
