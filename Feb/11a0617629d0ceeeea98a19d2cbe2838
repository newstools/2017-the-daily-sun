THE family of a taxi driver who is missing is desperately looking for him. The Sibisi family from Esigodini near Vryheid, northern KZN are praying for him to be found alive. Bonginkosi Sibisi (41) worked as a driver on the route between Joburg and Soweto. His family said his taxi was probably hijacked as it was found a day later with bloodstains in Ladysmith, KZN. His sister, Ngoneni Sibisi (40), said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll only have peace in our hearts when we find Bonginkosi.&rdquo; His girlfriend, Busisiwe Simelane (43), lived with him in Ramaphosa squatter camp, Ekurhuleni. She said she last saw him when he left for work on the morning of 16 February. &ldquo;I found it strange that he didn&rsquo;t return home at his normal time. &ldquo;When I called him, his phone was on voicemail,&rdquo; she said. Taxi owner Mandla Dubazane (47) said: &ldquo;I called the tracker company, which led me to Ladysmith, where I found my taxi the next day. &ldquo;The number plate had been changed from GP to ND. &ldquo;I suspect the thugs beat the driver and dumped him somewhere.&rdquo; The police were not able to provide details regarding Bonginkosi&rsquo;s disappearance at the time of going to print.
