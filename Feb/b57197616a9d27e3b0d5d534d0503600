A GIRL aged 14 was killed after she apparently witnessed a rape.&nbsp; A 26-year old man allegedly suffocated her with a pillow in the early hours of Sunday in Wesselsbron, Free State.&nbsp; This happened after Sebina Mthombene allegedly saw him rape her 18-year-old friend while they were all sharing a bed.&nbsp; According to witnesses, the suspect and the two friends had come from a tavern and had gone to the suspect&rsquo;s house, where they all slept in one bed.&nbsp; It is alleged the suspect woke up and raped the drunken 18-year-old girl, who had passed out.&nbsp; Sebina woke up and saw the suspect allegedly raping her friend.&nbsp; When the raped girl woke up she ran to the local police station.&nbsp; While she was there, the suspect is alleged to have suffocated Sebina, believed to be his girlfriend.&nbsp; Her gogo, Anna Maseng (80), said she was shocked and saddened by the murder.&nbsp; &ldquo;On Sunday we woke up to the bad news from a neighbour that Sebina had been killed.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little while later the suspect&rsquo;s family came and took us to where her body was.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said the last time she saw her granddaughter was when her friend came to fetch her on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not believe Sebina was in a relationship with that man.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was very shy and still at school, doing grade 8.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think this man was worried that she witnessed what he did to the other girl, so he suffocated her.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must be locked up and left to rot in jail,&rdquo; said gogo Anna.&nbsp; Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng said: &ldquo;A 26-year-old man was arrested after a 14-year-old girl was found dead and an 18-year-old girl was raped at his home. The suspect was charged with murder and rape.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thakeng said Warrant Officer Jaco Botha found the man and arrested him at his home.&nbsp; He will appear in Wesselsbron Magistrates Court soon.
