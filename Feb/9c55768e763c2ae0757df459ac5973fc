FROM THE moment the mother took the newborn baby boy in her arms, she knew it wasn&rsquo;t her child. Two years later, she got confirmation that her baby girl had gone to a different woman. TO THIS DAY, THE MOTHER IS HOPING HER OWN BABY WILL BE GIVEN BACK TO HER. The horror story began on 2 October 2010 when two newborn babies were swapped at Tambo Memorial Hospital in Ekurhuleni. The mother from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni Gauteng, who is now 36 years old, told Daily Sun when a baby boy was put in her arms she suspected he was not her child. She had been told her child was a girl. But she still raised the child as her own, with the dark question always in her mind. But then the woman and her boyfriend had a breakup. She wanted out of the relationship and demanded maintenance. The boyfriend protested. He said he wasn&rsquo;t even sure if it was his child. The woman headed to the maintanance court, and the man demanded a paternity test.That&rsquo;s when their suspicions were confirmed.It was proved the boy was not their child. A trip to the hospital uncovered the truth.&ldquo;They thought it was a joke when I told them about my problem,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;It was only when I showed them the paternity results that they believed me.&rdquo;The hospital took two weeks to locate the baby and they brought both families together. &ldquo;For the first time I met my own child and the lady who raised her. I was happy, but only for a short while. &ldquo;The medical staff suggested we keep the child until they were all ready to make the exchange,&rdquo; said the mum.&ldquo;They also said the children should be old enough to decide with whom they wanted to stay.&rdquo;That was in 2013 and the furious mum still hasn&rsquo;t received her child.&ldquo;I am raising somebody else&rsquo;s son. His mother must bring my child back to me. &ldquo;This boy doesn&rsquo;t sleep at night. He cries and he has terrible dreams,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The negligence of hospital staff has cost me my happiness.&rdquo;She said she is worried she may never get her own child back.&ldquo;The woman has now run away with my daughter. The phone number she gave to the hospital doesn&rsquo;t exist and we don&rsquo;t know where she is.&ldquo;Wherever this woman is, I plead with her to return my daughter.&rdquo;Daily Sun is in possession of the paternity results of both families and the parents, which proves the terrible mistake that should never have happened.
