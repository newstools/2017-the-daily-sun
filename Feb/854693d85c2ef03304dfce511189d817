ABSA Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns will take nothing for granted when they face Chippa United at East London&rsquo;s Sisa Dukashe Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Downs face a backlog of fixtures due to their success in winning the Caf Champions League and the PSL were forced to squeeze in this match five days before they face DR Congo&rsquo;s TP Mazembe in the Caf Super Cup final at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday.The Super Cup is played annually between the Champions League winners and the Caf Confederation Cup holders. Brazilians head coach Pitso Mosimane would have preferred to have the Chippa fixture postponed to focus on the Super Cup.Downs, fresh from their 6-0 hammering of Orlando Pirates at Loftus last Saturday, are on a roll. But their massive win over Bucs is history, says defender Wayne Arendse.The centre-back stated: &ldquo;The 6-0 win is behind us. We are looking ahead and next up are Chippa. We would be happy to beat them 1-0. The main thing is to collect three points.&rdquo; Arendse, who played a major role in winning the Champions League, said they would focus on the Super Cup after playing the Chilli Boys.He said: &ldquo;We will focus on the Super Cup after we&rsquo;ve played Chippa. We have been taking it one game at a time and that works for us. We can&rsquo;t get ahead of ourselves.&rdquo;He said he expected Chippa to come at them guns blazing: &ldquo;They are a good side on the ball and will want to express themselves against us. We have been analysing them and know what to expect. &ldquo;They will also want to show us they can play and beat us. But we&rsquo;ll be ready. The important thing is to keep another clean sheet.&rdquo;
