NOT having a schoolbag printed with the school&rsquo;s motto should not interfere with the education of pupils.This was a district official&rsquo;s instruction to Igagasi High School principal Patrick Tenze in U section, Umlazi, south of Durban. A special meeting was called on Wednesday after pupils clashed with the principal over their school bags. The principal banned pupils who had branded bags that weren&rsquo;t part of the school uniform from coming to school.According to Tenze, all children had to buy bags in the school colours with the school&rsquo;s logo on them for R135. He told Daily Sun this would help address the issue of pupils fighting over Nike and Adidas branded bags because they were stolen and exchanged at neighbouring schools.But some parents and pupils refused to carry out his instructions. Parent Zodwa Shange (42) from Malukazi said she was pleased with the decision taken at the meeting. &ldquo;I am happy the meeting came to a fair decision. Our kids come from different backgrounds.&ldquo;Some of us are not employed and depend on social grants. Complying with the sudden school law was not easy at all.&rdquo; Tenze said learning was continuing without disruptions. &ldquo;The district official said I should give parents enough time to buy the bags I suggested. Pupils will continue to come to school with the ones they have for now.&rdquo; KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: &ldquo;We are happy classes went back to normal. Education is a basic right for every child, whether there are challenges or misunderstandings at school. It is not compulsory for pupils to have bags with the school logo on them.&rdquo;
