EVEN THE zama zamas and the rescue workers refuse to go down to the bottom of the dangerous mine shaft. But angry residents want little Richard to be brought to the surface, dead or alive. GIVE US THE OXYGEN MASKS AND WE WILL FETCH HIM OURSELVES, THEY SAID.&nbsp; Yesterday, residents from Jerusalem squatter camp near Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, blocked roads with burning tyres, tree stumps and rocks, demanding action, not promises. This was after five-year-old Richard Thole slipped and fell into one of the dangerous mine shafts in the area on Saturday.Later in the day, rescue workers went down the shaft, but could not get deeper than 100 metres down the narrow hole.They said it was too dark, too dangerous and that the gas there could kill them.The desperate residents turned to the Basotho zama zamas who live among them and operate the illegal mining operations.The Basotho went some way down the hole but also had to turn back. They needed gas masks and offered to do the dangerous work for R30 000.A resident told Daily Sun they tried to collect the money but they couldn&rsquo;t get the required amount. &ldquo;We managed to collect some money but it did not reach the amount they demanded,&rdquo; said the resident.On Sunday morning, the residents tried to go down the shaft themselves but they realised they too needed oxygen masks.This led to the protest yesterday, when residents demanded to be provided with the equipment they needed.They wanted oxygen masks to go down the shaft themselves and remove the child.The devastated parents of the little boy said they are praying their child would be found.&ldquo;We are not sure if our son is still alive. We want him to at least be found as this will give us closure,&rdquo; said Meshack Mohlala.Residents said they have been asking the municipality to close the five dangerous shafts in the two squatter camps.&ldquo;We are living in hell but we have nowhere else to go,&rdquo; they said.Richard is the third person to have fallen into a shaft in the last six months in Angelo and Jerusalem squatter camps.The bodies of the two other victims were also never recovered.One of the victims, Bizolenkosi Dlamini (19) was kidnapped by members of the Basotho gang and thrown down a shaft in October. Her father, Joseph Dlamini, is still living in hope that his daughter will be brought to the surface.Daily Sun has covered many stories highlighting the danger faced by the residents of the two squatter camps but Ekurhuleni Municipality maintains it can&rsquo;t close the shafts as they are on private land.Yesterday, Ekurhuleni MMC of Community Safety, Vivian Chauke faced the angry residents after community leaders managed to calm them.She told residents a committee has been formed to close down the open mine shafts in the area.&ldquo;We are going to have a meeting where we can address the situation.&rdquo;She couldn&rsquo;t say when the shafts would be closed.Mayor Mzwandile Masina also visited the area yesterday and told residents that emergency services would return to try and retrieve the child.
