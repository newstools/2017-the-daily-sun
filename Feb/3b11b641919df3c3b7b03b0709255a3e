HE TRICKED people into believing he could get them jobs. For a while he got away with it as people believed his story, and he would rob his victims. But recently he met his match!Ivory Park police spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said the suspect approached a woman in Midrand and promised he would find her a job.&ldquo;After introducing himself, he told the woman that his employer in President Park, Midrand was looking for a helper.&ldquo;The suspect went on to rob the woman of her two cellphones,&rdquo; Matimulane said.But with the help of some people, she managed to trace one of the phones a few days later. They lured the suspect into a meeting in extension 3, Ivory Park. The people grabbed the man and took him to the police station, where he was detained.&ldquo;As things turned out there was no job and the 37-year-old suspect himself was not employed,&rdquo; said Matimulane.The police are calling on members of the public whose property was stolen in a similar way to come to the station or call Sergeant William Matlhabe on 083 984 8917. The suspect will appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court to face a charge of theft.
