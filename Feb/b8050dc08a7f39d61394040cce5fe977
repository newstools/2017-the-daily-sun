PARENTS of pupils at Sediba Sa Tsebo Primary School in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane almost closed the school last week.They were angry after three dagga plants were found in the school premises on Monday.They went to the school and demanded a meeting with the principal before putting a board on the gate that read &ndash; dagga school!Klaas Malibe (50) said the reason they didn&rsquo;t closed down the school was because of their kids. &ldquo;We know that if we close the school, our children will fall behind in their school work,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean we are going to stop looking for answers about the dagga.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if anyone is dealing in dagga here in the school. &ldquo;Who knows? Maybe there are other illegal activities that are going on around in this school that we don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo; The parents said it was impossible that the gardener who worked at the school could not have seen the dagga. &ldquo;We want the principal to be disciplined because she has not done her job,&rdquo; said another parent, Nomzamo Langa. Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said they were satisfied with the principal&rsquo;s response. He said if any parent had information about who could have planted the dagga, they should come forward.&ldquo;This is of course a wild plant and it can grow anywhere.&rdquo;
