GATVOL people with disabilities have had enough of sexual abuse. Mzansi Disabled Organisation members from the Ugu region took to the streets of Port Shepstone on KZN&rsquo;s South Coast on Wednesday to protest against sexual offenders who target people with disabilities.They kicked off the proceedings in Ryder Street and marched to Nelson Mandela Drive before handing over a memorandum of grievances to judiciary officials at Chris Hani Square.The march coincided with the court appearance of a man who allegedly raped a disabled 11-year-old boy in Bhobhoyi kasi last year. The suspect was denied bail in the Port Shepstone Magistrates Court. March co-ordinator Phillip Gamede told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We saw fit to support the victim and his family. We want to make sure the perpetrators who rape disabled people are convicted and given life sentences.&ldquo;We also demand that cases of this nature be investigated by special investigators.&ldquo;Cases of this sort must be fast tracked because if victims are mentally disturbed, they could forget key facts at the trial, which could lead to the accused going free.&rdquo; The protesters said they want the memorandum to reach Justice and Constitutional Development Minister Michael Masutha, as well as Police Minister Nathi Nhleko.The memorandum was accepted by head of the judiciary in Port Shepstone, Basil King. He promised to forward it to the relevant departments.
