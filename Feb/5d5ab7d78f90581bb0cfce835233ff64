MAMELODI Sundowns defender Thabo Nthethe allegedly faces a bleak future.Sources claim the veteran player is frustrated, as the club has yet to renew his contract, expiring in June.Nthethe had allegedly exercised the one-year renewal option last year. This was after his two-and-a-half-year contract had lapsed when joining Downs from Bloemfontein Celtic in 2011.A source claimed Downs&rsquo; management had been dragging its feet since promising him a two-year deal last year.The mole said it was clear the player&rsquo;s days with Sundowns were numbered.&ldquo;The fact that he was dropped from the squad that beat Celtic 1-0 in an away opening league match this week is a sign that he better get ready to put his Chloorkop days behind him,&rdquo; the first source said. And although the 32-year-old played a key role in Downs lifting the Caf Champions League trophy, he has struggled to cement his place in coach Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s side since the arrival of Brazilian-born defender, Ricardo Nascimento, in June.&ldquo;Nthethe is concerned that management is not professional enough to tell him if he is no longer needed at the club,&rdquo; the second mole said. &ldquo;He gave them terms for the new offer, but no one has bothered to respond.&rdquo;The source added Nthethe&rsquo;s career with the African Champions could end similarly to that of legendary midfielder Surprise Moriri, who was rescued by rookies Highlands Park. &ldquo;They did the same to Surprise, who had been loyal to the club for 12 years,&rdquo; the insider said. &ldquo;They made empty promises that Surprise would be drafted into the Downs&rsquo; technical setup as he continued playing, but reality struck that he was left in the cold when his contract expired.&rdquo; Nthethe has allegedly since called on agent Tim Sukazi for help.&ldquo;This, he hopes, will help him secure a new deal with billionaire owner Patrice Motsepe&rsquo;s club.&rdquo;
