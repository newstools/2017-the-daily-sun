About 92 farms in Limpopo have been invaded by the worm. Most of the farms are in Bela-Bela, Thabazimbi, Mookgophong and Lephalale. Nine insect killing chemicals have since been used to fight the worm.Minister Zokwana said it is important for everyone to work together to deal with the invasion.&ldquo;We are working to protect their farms. &ldquo;If we want to put an end to this invasion, we must make sure the worms do not lay any eggs,&rdquo; she said.

The worm can travel up to 2 000km a year in search of warmer weather.While armyworms can damage mealie plants in nearly all stages of development, they concentrate on plants that are not ripe.MEC Mokaba-Phokwana said her department will support farmers and make sure measures are taken to protect their crops.Over R8,4 million has been put aside to deal with the worm invasion.Farmer Jacob Muller said he has already sprayed insect killing chemicals around his farm. He said he has spent a lot of money on fighting the invasion and thanked the minister for supporting farmers.
