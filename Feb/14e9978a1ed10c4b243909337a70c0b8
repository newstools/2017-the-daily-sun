VETERAN Highlands Park midfielder, Surprise Moriri, says retirement is the last thing on his mind. Moriri (36), who is looking healthier than many youngsters, believes he can still play until 40 and above.The former Mamelodi Sundowns most-decorated footballer, is also working on his coaching badges. The modest Moriri has a B coaching licence and is looking to study further to acquire a higher coaching qualification.He&rsquo;s dreaming of coaching in the Premiership in the future. Moriri said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working on my coaching qualification to make sure I empower myself. &ldquo;When I have enough time and opportunity I&rsquo;ll go for the A licence. I&rsquo;ve been working on this, so that at the end of my career I&rsquo;m left with more options of what to do. I&rsquo;ve been working hard behind the scenes. &ldquo;Who knows, one day I could even become a player coach and when that time comes I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo; Moriri&rsquo;s experience will come in handy for the relegation-haunted Park. As a senior player, he&rsquo;s expected to play a key role in their battle with relegation. He has been reunited with former coach, Gordon Igesund, who won the Premiership title at his former club. Moriri said: &ldquo;I believe we&rsquo;ve got enough depth to put up a good fight until the last game of the season.&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t get relegated. I see a lot of hunger and determination from the young players here and we have a good coach in Igesund, who knows what he&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;He also tipped his former club, the Tshwane giants &ndash; where he spent a decade &ndash; as the team to beat both on the domestic and African continent.Moriri said: &ldquo;Sundowns are a good team and they were not built in one season. It took coach Pitso Mosimane a couple of seasons to build this great team.&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve worked hard, and now they&rsquo;re reaping the rewards. For me, they&rsquo;re the team to beat.&rdquo;His goal for the year is to play as many games as he can to help Park retain their status.
