Orlando Pirates favorite's Thabo Rakhale and Thabo Qalinge are still a few weeks away from returning to the field of play - while Issa Sarr is set for an imminent return.The midfielders have been unavailable for selection in recent weeks and their influence has sorely been missed at Mayfair, and while Sarr may return to training later this week, he won't feature against Bidvest Wits on Wednesday.According to the club's official website, Rakhale's hamstring problem could keep him out for 2-3 weeks but Qalinge could be in line for an earlier return, which will be announced following another medical scan this week.First-choice goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo is set for an early recovery too, after scans allayed fears of any serious ligament damage to the South Africa international.&nbsp;Midfielder's Gift Motupa, Mpho Makola and Edwin Gyimah are nursing some niggling injuries but may feature against the Clever Boys at Orlando Stadium.
