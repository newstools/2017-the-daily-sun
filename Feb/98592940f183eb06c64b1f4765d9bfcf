A brace from Chippa United's Lerato Manzini was cancelled out by two goals from Golden Arrows striker Lerato Lamola in a 2-2 league draw at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Friday night.The Chilli Boys dished out some wonderful football in the first half, dominating proceedings though not posing much of a threat in the box, with the exception of their goal. The second half was far more evenly balanced with both sides looking dangerous on attack and by the time the dust had settled on a riveting night's action, the draw was probably a fair reflection of the game.Enjoying some wonderful support in the stands, the home side turned on the style from kick off, the usually skillful Arrows side finding themselves chasing shadows at times.Lerato Lamola could have put his side in front in the opening minutes, but skewed his shot wide from right in front of goal.But he made amends in the 15th minute by sweeping home Menzi Masuku's cut-back in to the far corner, following a superb solo run down the right by the former Pirates winger.The Eastern Cape side continued to dictate the pace of the play in the opening half, but did little more than toy with their opponents as no further cleat-cut chances materialised in that period.The failure to turn superiority into chances seemed to have proven costly for Chippa when Arrows leveled matters five minutes after the break through a Lerato Lamola scorcher, hit into the top corner from 25-yards out, on the run.But the Chilli Boys regained their lead just three minutes after that when the ever-energetic and dangerous Masuku whipped in a great cross which Manzini headed in at the near post.Arrows looked to hit back and came close just after the hour mark when Lamola arrived fractionally too late to slide in a cross.With play now going end-to-end, Chippa were next to have a chance when Buyani Sali fired over the bar in the 72nd minute.The equaliser came seven minutes from time when Lamola ghosted in at the back post to find the roof of the net with a first-time half-volley.The home side rallied for a winner, but the Durban team just about did enough to get over the line to claim a point which seemed unlikely in the first half.
