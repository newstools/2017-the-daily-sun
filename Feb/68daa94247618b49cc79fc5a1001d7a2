MARTHA Mahlangu could not hold back her tears as she watched her stall being bulldozed to the ground . The 46-year-old vendor from Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, said she has been selling food for over eight years and all the profit she makes is spent on educating her children.But on Friday she was one of many vendors who watched helplessly as stalls were destroyed.&ldquo;No one came to warn us.&ldquo;The bulldozer just came out of nowhere and destroyed our stalls.&rdquo;According to Martha, the bulldozer was accompanied by several Tshwane Metro cop vehicles.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore because that was the only way I could support my family.&rdquo;According to another vendor, Nelisiwe Skhosana (32), bulldozers destroy food stalls every month.&ldquo;They always tell us they want to develop this area. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been four years and the same thing keeps happening every month. &ldquo;We want to be left in peace. &ldquo;The money we make here helps us to take care of our families,&rdquo; she said.Tshwane Metro cop spokesman, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t go there to destroy anything. &ldquo;Our job is to monitor whether the vendors are following the rules of the municipality.&rdquo; He said if they find that rules are not being followed, they give the vendors a chance to fix their mistake before removing their stall.
