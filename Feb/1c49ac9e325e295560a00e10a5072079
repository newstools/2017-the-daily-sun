I T&rsquo;S the Month of Love, but folks are still annoying. Last week, a woman wanted to know why I include the penis subject in my column. So, why do I mention the penis once a week? Well, because I don&rsquo;t have a daily column. I love the penis, and because it&rsquo;s funny, especially when it&rsquo;s flaccid.As for that woman, why do so many people ask such stupid questions? Is the aim to annoy, or to perpetuate the stereotype that women are better looked at than heard?C&rsquo;mon, stop acting dumb. You&rsquo;re better than that!But for those who occasionally suffer blonde moments, please remember not to ask stupid questions like these:Did you enjoy sex with me? He&rsquo;s a man, do the math.Don&rsquo;t you love me any more? Well, you should know the answer &ndash; if you&rsquo;re asking.I hope he likes me. Hun, don&rsquo;t forsake yourself for appearances.Why don&rsquo;t you ever take me out to meet your friends? Is this even a question?Why are you never home? C&rsquo;mon, hun!Are you wearing a condom? That&rsquo;s one of the strangest questions women ask. It&rsquo;s as if they are too scared to take responsibility for things they put in their bodies.Why don&rsquo;t you ever call me first? This one is just hilarious. It assumes you&rsquo;re a bum waiting around for his calls &ndash; and attention.Now ladies please &ndash; for the love of all things logic &ndash; stop asking dumb questions. It reflects badly on all of us, especially those of us who read.Remember ladies, you are better than that.You are breadwinners and household heads. So, don&rsquo;t be that woman, who asks questions to answers she already knows.Here are sensible questions for any self-respecting woman:Why does your opinion matter in my life?Why do I have to force you to be a present dad?Why are we renting in Sandton when we can buy elsewhere as opulent?Why do we need luxury cars when our children&rsquo;s education can be complemented with extra lessons?How can I be helpful in my community?Are my children safe in bed &ndash; when I spend nights out looking for a new father?Why do you cheat on me? This is a great one!So ladies, ask meaningful questions to solve problems, not to fixate.
