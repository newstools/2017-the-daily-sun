VENDORS that sell food at Fort Jackson in East London are very happy. Buffalo City Municipality is planning to build them shelters.Zoliswa Simandla (53) started working there in 2012. She sells chips, bread, fat cakes, sausages and sweets and told Daily Sun she is very happy the municipality is going to develop the area. &ldquo;The situation here is bad. The weather affects us because we do not have shelters. Our food is sometimes difficult to sell, especially when there is a huge wind. &ldquo;Dust coats the food and people do not want to buy food that is dusty. &ldquo;We tried to make shacks for shelter but they do not last and they leak. &ldquo;When there is a lot of rain it&rsquo;s like standing out in the open.&rdquo; Nowhakazi Kilani (45) has been selling meat, bread and sour milk at her stall for six years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run out of words to thank our municipality for this promise. &ldquo;We do not have taps, shelters or toilets here. &ldquo;To use the toilet or fetch water, we have to ask for favours,&rdquo; she said.Buffalo City municipal spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said the metro is developing the area into an economic hub which will have hawkers&rsquo; stalls.&ldquo;Currently, the metro&rsquo;s local economic development section is accessing funding from the shared economic infrastructure fund that falls under the Small Business Development department. &ldquo;At the moment, the plans for the hub are still in the beginning stage.&rdquo;
