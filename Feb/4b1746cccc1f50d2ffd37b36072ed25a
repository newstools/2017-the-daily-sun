FORMER Eskom head Brian Molefe was not fit and proper to be a member of Parliament, Democratic Alliance chief whip John Steenhuisen has said.This after Parliament announced today that Molefe had been nominated to fill a vacancy on the Northern Cape list of ANC MPs.He has not been sworn in yet.Steenhuisen on Friday said they were looking forward to reporting Molefe to Parliament&rsquo;s ethics committee, once he was sworn in.Molefe resigned from Eskom following former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's report into state capture, in which he was mentioned numerous times.&ldquo;He is going to be a gift to the opposition,&rdquo; Steenhuisen said.The DA chief whip also questioned the use of Parliamentary communications to announce an ANC appointment.&ldquo;This is unprecedented,&rdquo; he said.He said parliament&rsquo;s new communications head Moloto Mothapo, the former ANC caucus spokesperson, had failed his first test.Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said this was confirmation of their suspicions of an imminent cabinet reshuffle.&ldquo;This is proof that Zuma is hell-bent on getting his person in. It&rsquo;s amazing because this is someone who was mentioned in the state capture report, repeatedly.&rdquo;He reiterated earlier fears from his party that Molefe would be made finance minister.Molefe featured extensively in the State of Capture report, which was released following a court order.The report included damning details on the relationship between Molefe and the controversial Gupta family.Molefe and Ajay Gupta, the eldest of three Gupta brothers, made 58 telephone calls to one another between August 2015 and March 2016, according to the report.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/brian-molefe-not-fit-to-be-mp-da-20170217
