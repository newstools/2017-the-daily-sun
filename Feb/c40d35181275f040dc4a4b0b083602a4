PREPARATIONS for exams have to start now if you want to be ready when it&rsquo;s time to write.This is why grade 4 kids need to start preparing.Marinda Botha, educational psychologist at Momentum Multiply, said parents must spend more time teaching their children study techniques that will help them pass their exams.&ldquo;If children are left to figure this out on their own, they will often just reread the study material which does not help them that much. This is not an effective way of studying, because their work will just keep piling up,&rdquo; she said.Here are her tips to help your child pass their exams.- Let them spell out words aloud.- Get them to write the word down. Do it with them.- Say the word or show a picture of the word, and if they misspell it, let them write the correct spelling out three times.- Put their spelling list up somewhere where they will see it a few times, for example, on the mirror where they brush their teeth.How to comprehend test questions- Teach them to read the questions first and underline important words.- Show them how to re-read the text if they still don&rsquo;t understand it fully. - Some children find it helpful to say the words loudly while they read, but remember that it&rsquo;s different in the exam room as they won&rsquo;t be allowed to read the words aloud.- After reading a question, they must use their finger to scan through the text to find the answer. Marking important information- Teach them how to identify important information when you read together by highlighting or underlining the words.- Taking some time out after work or school with your children and going through their school work with them, helps them become the best performers at school.
