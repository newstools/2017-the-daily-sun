JAMES Magagula (42) is a worried man.He said bad luck seems to be following him after he was mistakenly bust last year.Not only has he lost his job as a security guard, he claims his wife might also leave him. James, from Kabokweni near Mbombela, Mpumalanga said he was mistakenly bust for robbery, but the charge was withdrawn after his fingerprints didn&rsquo;t match the ones of the real thug. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d simply carry on with my life, but that ride in the back of a police van is haunting me. Police records show I am a convicted criminal, while I am walking the streets a free man,&rdquo; he said.James said he found out about his criminal record when he applied for his security accreditation with the private security industry regulatory authority. It was discovered that he had a criminal record dating back to 1995, so he couldn&rsquo;t go back to work.&ldquo;I went to Kabokweni Police Station to check. Police confirmed that there was no conviction on the robbery charge against me, only a withdrawal. &ldquo;Instead, records showed I had been bust for selling booze without a licence. &ldquo;But cops later found that it wasn&rsquo;t me who was arrested for the offence.&rdquo; Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said an appointment has been made for James to see the Kabokweni station commander so that cops can investigate further.
