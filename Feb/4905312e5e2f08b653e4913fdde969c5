GRAVEYARD robbers have moved from kasi cemeteries to robbing graveyards in the CBD.The Forest Hill Cemetery in Humewood, Port Elizabeth is the new hunting ground for robbers.Colonel Priscilla Naidu told Daily Sun they want to warn mourners to be cautious and vigilant. &ldquo;Since last month, at least four robberies have taken place at the cemetery,&rdquo; Naidu said.&ldquo;The victims are mainly women who are attacked alone or in pairs. The robbers threatened them with knives and force them to take them to their vehicles, where they rob them of their belongings. &ldquo;This happens during the day and at night. Sometimes they prey on joggers and pedestrians too.&rdquo;She said the graveyard is a quiet place and the robbers lie in wait for their victims. &ldquo;We advise mourners, especially women, not to go alone to the cemetery. &ldquo;They should always be in the company of men.&rdquo;Nosakhele Mpenzu (37), said: &ldquo;Even at Motherwell Cemetery, we often hear people screaming for help.&rdquo;
