Orlando Pirates interim coach Augusto Palacios believes that the club are still alive in the race to win the Premiership title despite trailing the leaders by nine points.The Sea Robbers dropped more points in their quest to climb the table when they were held to a 0-0 draw by Platinum Stars on Wednesday. The club are in 10th position and seemingly have a long way to go to catch joint leaders Cape Town City, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United.However, Palacios is refusing to throw in the towel just yet. He told reporters: "It's not a blaming game and I'm happy with the players' fighting attitude but if we are not scoring goals, we have to make changes."We are playing Mamelodi Sundowns over the weekend, we need to work on the scoring and finishing our chances in the next two days. I don't believe our chances to win the league are dashed. We will continue fighting. We have Sundowns, Cape Town City and Polokwane City (to come)."
