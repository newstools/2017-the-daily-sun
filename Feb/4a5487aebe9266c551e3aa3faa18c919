THE MINISTER and the girl enjoyed sika lekhekhe.But when she asked him for a blessing . . .&nbsp;HE GAVE HER THE COLD SHOULDER!&nbsp;This astonishing allegation comes from the gorgeous Tshwaledi Modiba, who met a handsome guy at the Cubana Club in Pretoria.At the time, the young beauty said she had no idea she was flirting with Michael Masutha, Minister of Justice and Correctional Services.She only found out shortly before he allegedly gave her bedroom justice and a good correctional serving!Tshwaledi made a detailed account of what happened between her and the minister, backed up by smartphone messages.She said: &ldquo;The waitress told me there&rsquo;s a guy who&rsquo;s interested in me and wanted to buy us drinks. He bought us a bottle of Hennessy and invited us into the VIP section.&rdquo;&nbsp;She then swapped phone numbers with the man, and called him the next day.&nbsp;&ldquo;He told me about his meeting at Luthuli House (ANC&rsquo;s headquarters) and that&rsquo;s when it struck me he might be a politician. So, I googled Michael Masutha and asked a friend if she knew of him.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to Tshwaledi, the friend surprised her with an allegation that she&rsquo;d had a fling with Masutha.&nbsp;&ldquo;She told me he&rsquo;s not generous when it comes to giving out cash. But I thought my friend was just being jealous,&rdquo; Tshwaledi claimed.&nbsp;She told the SunTeam Masutha eventually invited her to his house in the upmarket Tshwane suburb of Waterkloof.&nbsp;&ldquo;I told him I was coming with a friend and he sent his driver to pick us up,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Tshwaledi alleged: &ldquo;At his house we all had drinks. I went upstairs with him and we had sex while my friend was downstairs with another guy,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Her disappointment began after the bedroom gymnastics, said Tshwaledi.&nbsp;&ldquo;When he&rsquo;d had what he wanted, he kept telling me he&rsquo;d be busy with the Sona for a while.&rdquo;&nbsp;She claimed: &ldquo;A few days later, I asked him for cash, and he started acting all dodgy. I&rsquo;m not bitter, but I don&rsquo;t want him to take advantage of other girls,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Yesterday, when called, Masutha was said to be in a meeting.&nbsp;His spokesperson, Mthunzi Mhaga, yesterday said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a personal matter. Besides, the minister is in a meeting. Was she expecting marriage? &rdquo;
