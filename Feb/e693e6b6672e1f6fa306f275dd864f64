Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says the club will put up a fight despite potentially being without the services of three key players against Bidvest Wits.The Brazilians face the Clever Boys in what is a top-of-the-table clash on Saturday, but there are doubts over Khama Billiat, Anthony Laffor and Anele Ngcongca's involvement.A statement on the club's official website confirmed the injury concerns. It read: "All three players picked up injuries in the midweek league win against Platinum Stars. Ngcongca suffered a groin injury, while Laffor picked up an ankle injury and Billiat a dead leg."However, Mosimane is refusing to use their potential absence as an excuse. He said: "It would be a blow if we were to miss all three players at the same time, especially that our schedule is this tight, but we can never use that as an excuse. As long as we have 11 players on the field and seven substitutes, we have to fight on."Saturday's action gets underway from 18:00 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, and could be an encounter which has a significant say in the Premiership title race.
