FORMER Absa Premiership clubs playing in the National First Division (NFD) have vowed to make their presence felt in the second round. Having seen Thanda Royal Zulu, who were relegated to the NFD in 2007-08 season, excel in the first round, other former top flight clubs Jomo Cosmos, AmaZulu and University of Pretoria hope to emulate Thanda and stamp their authority in the second round, which kicks off on Saturday.Thanda top the table with 35 points from 15 first round outings.AmaZulu are in fourth place with 23 points followed by Cosmos in fifth place with 22 points, while AmaTuks are in ninth place with 21 points. AmaTuks host AmaZulu at Tuks Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm) and Cosmos visit Mthatha Bucks at Mthatha Stadium at the same time. Cosmos did not have a great start but towards the end of the first round played more convincing football and managed to climb up the standings. Cosmos captain Frederic Nsabiyumva told SunSport that they aimed to correct the errors made in the first round. He said: &ldquo;We are ready for the second round and we&rsquo;re going to up our game to make sure we bounce back to the PSL. We still have a chance of winning the title and believe we will do it.&rdquo;AmaTuks, who were relegated to the NFD last season along with Cosmos, have the same goal of bouncing back to the top flight. &ldquo;We have not given up on getting promotion, it&rsquo;s too early for us to throw in the towel,&rdquo; said AmaTuks captain Sibusiso Mthethwa &ldquo;We will focus more on ourselves this time. Those at the top of the table have not won it yet. Our main objective is to bounce back and we will. &ldquo;
