PALESA Nzala (20) was over the moon in December after she heard she was going to give birth to her first child.She even started taking multivitamins to improve her unborn child&rsquo;s health. But now Palesa, from Rammulotsi in Viljoenskroon, is upset because recent laboratory results confirmed she is not pregnant. Palesa claimed a nurse from Rammulotsi Clinic refused to accept responsibility for the mistake. Instead, the nurse allegedly told Palesa her body has a strange shape that suggested she was pregnant. Palesa told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I was looking forward to having my first baby. &ldquo;Sadly, all my excitement died when I received the laboratory results on Wednesday.&rdquo;She said she was shocked by how the nurse responded when she was shown the laboratory results.&ldquo;I went to the clinic to speak to the nurse. &ldquo;Her bad attitude and unprofessionalism made me feel abused. &ldquo;She did not even say sorry,&rdquo; claimed Palesa.Free State Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi said his department was not aware of the incident.Mvambi said: &ldquo;We will get her details so we can investigate further. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that the client claims she was not treated with dignity by a staff member. &ldquo;If a mistake was made, an apology will be issued to her.&rdquo;
