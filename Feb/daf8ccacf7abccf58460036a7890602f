THANDEKILE Thusi is a worried mother.The woman (54), from Ndumo near Jozini in KZN, said she cannot find a special school for her son, who is living with a disability.&ldquo;I am battling to find a special school for him so he can develop his writing skills,&rdquo; she said.Thandekile says her son, Saneliso (24), has been turned away by all the schools in the surrounding area because of his age.&ldquo;My son stays at home when his siblings go to school, and that breaks my heart. I want him to get an education so that he will be able to survive in future,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My son was born with his bones deformed. As a result he cannot walk, speak or use his hands properly.&rdquo;She said doctors had told her his bones were not fully developed before birth, so he would not be able to live a normal life.&ldquo;The early years of his childhood were very difficult, and that is why we took him to Sisizakele Special School only in 2008, when he was 15 years old. He studied there for four years and progressed very well, even learning to write with his toes. But in 2011, when he was 18, the school kicked him out and said they only took kids under 18,&rdquo; said Thandekile.Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana said Thandekile should take the problem of her son&rsquo;s schooling to the department&rsquo;s offices in Umkhanyakude.&ldquo;Our district director will know how to assist. Schools have different policies about the issue of age, but she will get help,&rdquo; he said.
