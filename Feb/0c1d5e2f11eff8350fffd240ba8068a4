MORE than 200 gatvol residents from Nelson Mandela squatter camp near KwaZakhele kasi, Port Elizabeth protested for two days, demanding RDP houses.On Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, they burned tyres and wood at the corner of Nobatana and Njoli streets. They shouted: &ldquo;We want our RDP houses. We have been waiting too long.&rdquo;It was a peaceful protest, although cars and buses were forced to use alternative routes. Sipho Njezula (39) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We have been waiting for our RDPs since 1994. What makes us angry is that there was a budget for houses on two occasions but it was not used for our RDPs. &ldquo;In 2008 they built RDP houses near Maselana Street, which is opposite us. They promised to come to our side but nothing happened. We are fed up with empty promises. They rezoned our area and gave us site numbers but some of the residents living here found out that their RDPs were built in Joe Slovo and Motherwell NU 29.&rdquo; Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;I am battling to get hold of the relevant officials because they know what is happening.&rdquo;
