THEIR kasi has been invaded by pigs!Residents of Masibambane Village, which is also known as Hostel in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage said they live in fear of the big, dirty animals roaming their streets. They claim the pigs arrive in their yards, eat the grass and even bars of soap.Zoleka Mahlangeni (53) said the pigs are a big problem.&ldquo;We cannot ever relax as these stubborn pigs arrive at any time and scratch themselves against our walls,&rdquo; said the mother of two.&ldquo;The washing lines have to be made higher. &ldquo;Sometimes the pigs mess up our clothes, and knock down the poles attached to the wash-lines,&rdquo; she said.Another resident, Mbongeni Ngesi (43), said it was no use chasing the pigs away because they simply came back the next day.&ldquo;They also scratch themselves on cars, leaving dents and marks. &ldquo;Most of us don&rsquo;t have walls between properties. If you dare leave your door open, you might bump into a pig in your kitchen!&rdquo;His neighbour, Kholisile Nzuzo (32), said the pigs eat anything in front of them.&ldquo;We fear they might eat our kids as well, because they always look hungry.&rdquo; Mthubanzi Mniki, spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Residents should report stray animals to the municipality. &ldquo;We will impound the animals and hand them over to the SPCA.&rdquo;
