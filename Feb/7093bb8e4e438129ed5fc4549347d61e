BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic&rsquo;s MultiChoice Diski Challenge team are determined to win the 2016-17 title.Siwelele&rsquo;s 3-2 victory over Orlando Pirates last weekend has given them the golden opportunity of topping the log table for the first time this season &ndash; and maybe for good. With just two games to go Celtic are leading the standings with 30 points, one point more than Mamelodi Sundowns, second with 29 points. The title race is now between these two teams but mathematically third-placed Bidvest Wits still have a chance.Downs had occupied the No 1 spot since last November. As things stand now, there is a very real possibility that the Brazilians won&rsquo;t bounce back. They may come to regret dropping points at this stage.But this situation is not new to them, as they did the same last season. In the remaining fixtures, Celtic will play Ajax Cape Town and Baroka FC, while the Brazilians have tough encounters lined up against Kaizer Chiefs at the King Zwelethini Stadium on Sunday and against Cape Town City on the final day of the season on 25 February. Celtic will need win their remaining two games to be crowned champions.Siwelele captain Shadrack Kobedi says that although they are top of the standings now, they won&rsquo;t get carried away with two more games to go. He said: &ldquo;It has been a tough season for us and we are happy to be where we are now. We have done better than last season but we are not done. It is too early for us to be popping the champagne. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t take the remaining two games lightly, we will stay focused and fight for the six points.&rdquo;
