SUPERSPORT United have increased their unbeaten record in the Absa Premiership to 14 games following their convincing 5-2 victory against Golden Arrows at Lucas Moripe stadium on Wednesday night. The last time United lost a game was against their archrivals Mamelodi Sundowns last year in August when they lost 3-1. Matsatsantsa A Pitori moved back on top of log with 28 points from 15 games. Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City share the same points with United but Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s charges have an upper hand on goal difference. The first-half saw both teams failing to create goal scoring chances; however, the second stanza was more electrifying as it produced seven goals that were scored in the match. United looked more refreshed and came gun blazing, with Reneilwe Letsholonyane breaking the ice in the 46th minutes. Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Mandla Masango made his debut for United after he started the game but he had little influence in SuperSport&rsquo;s attacking force and was replaced by Thuso Phala, who scored the second goal for the home side in the 48th minutes. Zimbabwean midfielder Kudakwashe Mahachi &nbsp;pulled one back for the visiting side, but Arrows striker Chiukepo Msowoya on his debut made matters worse when he scored on his own net to give United a 3-1 lead. Minutes later, midfielder Alexandra Cole tapped in Thabo Mnyamane&rsquo;s cross in the 65th minutes to give United a 4-1 lead. With the game opening on both sides, substitution Lerato Lamola scored a second goal for Arrows but another former Chiefs player Morgan Gould headed inside Arrows net to beat keeper Nkosingiphile Gumede to make it 5-2 for United. SuperSport will now shift focus from the PSL to CAF Confederations as they will travel to Madagascar to face Elgeco Plus on February 12.&nbsp;
