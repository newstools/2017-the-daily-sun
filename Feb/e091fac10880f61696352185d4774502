Jomo Cosmos owner and South African soccer legend Dr Jomo Sono has described Mamelodi Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane as workaholic and arrogant coach.Mosimane, who began his professional soccer career as a striker under the tutelage of Sono at Jomo Cosmos back in 1982, has been gradually building his reputation as one of the country's most successful coach since cutting his teeth in coaching at Supersport United in 2000/01 season."Look, Pitso has always shown potential in coaching back from 2001 where he took over as a head coach from assistant role at Supersport," Sono told&nbsp;Vodacom soccer."Pitso has done very well so far as a young coach. He is a workaholic and very arrogant, but he has unfortunately inherited arrogance from me (laughing), because he is one of my products (as a player)."He has got his own head, when he has decided he has decided, and believes in the decision he has taken."He has done well despite enduring some difficult times where some of Sundowns supporters were calling for his sacking. His stay (at Downs) shows that the supporters nearly got rid of the good coach, which tells you about an importance of supporters' role of being patient towards the team's coach under difficult circumstances.Having ended the year in seventh position on the Premiership table, six points behind three joint-leaders and with six games in hand, Pitso Mosimane's charges will resume their hectic league campaign by taking on Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein.
