Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola admits there's a chance they may not qualify for next season's Champions League, but pledged to do all he can to avoid that eventuality.City were one of the early favourites for the title after opening the season by winning their first six league games, but have since fallen off the pace a bit and go into Sunday's match against Swansea in fifth place.However, after both Liverpool and Arsenal lost on Saturday, a win for the Sky Blues would see them up to third behind Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.Even if they do pick up the victory, there are still six teams that can finish in the top four this term and Guardiola believes it is going to be a tough fight."It is possible that we won't qualify. Today we are not in the Champions League (positions)," he said."But we are going to see at the end of the season and then you will see my impression (of it). Let us fight until the end. Let me try at least that - fight."Regardless of what happens this season, the Spanish mentor acknowledges one of his next jobs will be to revitalise an ageing defence."We realise that we have a lot of players over 30. For example, full-backs are 31, 32," he added."But they are so important. We cannot change absolutely everything in one season. I can understand how important Yaya (Toure), Kolarov or Gael are, or the personality from Pablo, in the locker room."At the end, the heart and soul of the team are the old players, the people who know the club."
