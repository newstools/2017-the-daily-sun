NORMALLY pastors encourage their church members to confide in them in times of trouble. But it seems Pastor Sipho Khanyile from Faith Mission Church in Ntuzuma, north of Durban, did not feel he had anyone to turn to.The 61-year-old pastor was found dead in his garage on Saturday.According to a member of the church, the pastor had attended a meeting with other pastors in the Durban CBD that morning.&ldquo;When he came back from the meeting, he went to the garage. &ldquo;A family member realised he had been gone for a long time. She went to look for him and found his body hanging from the ceiling,&rdquo; said the church member.She said no one knows why the pastor killed himself because he didn&rsquo;t leave a note.Another resident said Sipho had disobeyed the word of God.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how a man we seek guidance from could do this. &ldquo;How could he let whatever was bothering him get the better of him? He should have asked for help.&rdquo;When the SunTeam visited the pastor&rsquo;s house, members of neighbouring churches were arriving.A woman who claimed to be related to the pastor&rsquo;s wife said the family does not want to comment because they are still grieving.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened at Ntuzuma Police Station after a man was found dead in his garage.
