KAIZER CHIEFS striker, Camaldine Abraw, is eager to come back and repay club faithfuls for their words of support while he was out injured.The Togolese hasn&rsquo;t played for Amakhosi since May last year, as he battled with a knee injury he sustained in June, during his international duty.That injury ultimately required surgery in July, but he&rsquo;s substantially ahead of schedule in regard to his recovering as he was initially ruled out for nine months. Now back at training, the 26-year-old said it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before he&rsquo;s back doing what he loves &ndash; playing for the Glamour Boys.&ldquo;For now, I&rsquo;m only doing light training, maybe I will finish it by next week. I&rsquo;m positive that I&rsquo;ll be fully fit in time to help my team,&rdquo; said Abraw. The former Free State Stars marksman admitted getting back at the team won&rsquo;t be easy.&ldquo;Currently the boys are doing well and winning games. It&rsquo;s going to take hard work and dedication on my side to crack it to the first team,&rdquo; he said.At the beginning of the season, Chiefs were in need of a striker of Abraw&rsquo;s calibre when things were not going smoothly. The tall hitman said he was had sleepless nights during those testing times.&ldquo;I love the team, so it was really frustrating to see them battling, and at that point I was powerless. It was really hard, not only for guys that were playing, but also for me as well. But I&rsquo;m glad all that is behind now,&rdquo; said Abraw.He also thanked Chiefs faithfuls who wished him well during his time of need.&ldquo;The fans are always there for us &ndash; in good times and bad. I just want to thank them for being there for me while I was nursing my injury. I can promise them that I will come back and repay their good faith in me,&rdquo; he added.
