NTOMBIFUTHI Gumbi claims to have lived with strange things in her house for many years. Until two weeks ago, when she decided enough was enough.The 45-year-old said she was woken up by a voice telling her to go and look for a sangoma, and not just any sangoma, but the one she saw in her dreams. &ldquo;I went in the direction the voice was sending me. It led me to sangoma Dabulamanzi. When I got there Dabulamanzi narrated my problems before I could even tell her why I was there.&rdquo;Ntombifuthi, of extension three in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni said: &ldquo;My family lived a life of fear and horror. My family members would be beaten up whenever we went out. We have been to many sangomas and prophets seeking help, but with no luck.&rdquo;But now, she claimed, things have changed for the better, ever since Dabulamanzi came to her home. &ldquo;She dug up something that resembled a horn. It was tied up with a red cloth, a 20 cent coin and dice. She also found a front leg or arm of what seemed to be a monkey or baboon, as well as what appeared to be human blood in a half litre bottle.&rdquo; Sangoma Precious Sithole, known as Dabulamanzi, told Daily Sun that the blood in the bottle, which smelled, had been mixed with muthi to cast a spell on the family.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why no one liked them. They will have to undergo certain rituals.&rdquo;
