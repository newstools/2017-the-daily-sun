AFRICAN football powerhouse Egypt will be hoping to extend their African Cup of Nations (Afcon) titles to eight.This when they take on fellow African giants, Cameroon, in the continental cup final at Stade d&rsquo;Angondje in Libreville, Gabon tonight (9pm).The Pharaohs marked their three tournaments absence with a cup final berth against The Indomitable Lions. The Egyptians are the most successful team in the history of Afcon, with seven titles.Cameroon, who are the 2019 Afcon host nation, are tied on four titles each with Ghana.It&rsquo;s a repeat of the Nations Cup final in Ghana 2008, when The Pharaohs broke The Indomitable Lions&rsquo; hearts with a 1-0 victory.But this year&rsquo;s final will be a different ball game as the two giants of African football renew their rivalry.The Indomitable Lions stunned pre-tournament favourites Ghana with a 2-0 victory to set up a cup final date with the Egyptians, who overcame 2013 finalists, Burkina Faso, in the penalty shoot-out.Egypt have conceded just one goal in five games as they go into the big match with the best defensive record in the competition.Cameroon who came into the tournament without several of their star players, are looking for their first title since 2002.They were not expected to get to the final, but they sent two pre-tournament favourites, Senegal and Ghana, packing against all odds.The Indomitable Lions finished second in Group A behind the Stallions of Burkina Faso, but they grew from strength to qualify for the deciding match.The Pharaohs won the group of death that had Togo, Ghana and Mali, with seven points without conceding a goal.They eliminated fellow North African giants Morocco and Burkina Faso on their road to the biggest match of the tournament.The Indomitable Lions defender, Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui, said they are looking to avenge their 2008 heartbreak.He said: &ldquo;Egypt are a big team.&ldquo;They have won seven titles and showed a very good performance so far.&ldquo;But we are determined to avenge our defeat in the 2008 final.&rdquo;Ngadeu-Ngadjui added: &ldquo;A lot of people didn&rsquo;t believe in us.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think that we could go so far in the competition, but now we want to win the title.&rdquo;The Pharaoh&rsquo;s coach, Hector Cuper, said he is confident of adding another continental title. Cuper said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m optimistic that Egypt will lift the trophy.&rdquo;
