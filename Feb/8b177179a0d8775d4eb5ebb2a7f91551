FOR two years, Salome Mapela (41) went from hospital to hospital, seeing different specialists, hoping to get medical help for her swollen leg.She was later diagnosed with elephantiasis and she now needs help from Good Samaritans.Salome hopes that if she can see a traditional doctor, she might be healed.Already the disease has affected her entire right leg, causing unbearable pain. And it appears to be spreading up her right side.Salome, a mum of two from Mahwelereng zone 2 in Limpopo, said doctors tried their best to help her, but with no luck. &ldquo;This disease started as a small wound on my leg. I thought it would heal, but I was shocked when my leg started getting swollen. &ldquo;This illness is so painful &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have peace at all. I can&rsquo;t even stand for few minutes, and I can&rsquo;t walk to the toilet without assistance.&rdquo; Salome&rsquo;s family believes that although pastors prayed for her and doctors used their medical knowledge to fight the disease, there might be a traditional healer out there who can heal her.Her mum Johanna Mapela (62) said: &ldquo;We believe that the disease will be healed as soon as Salome gets traditional help. &ldquo;At the moment no one is working at home.&ldquo;We survive on the money we get from the social grant. We&rsquo;re asking for help from the public to take Salome to a traditional healer.&rdquo;
