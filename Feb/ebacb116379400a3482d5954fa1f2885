KAIZER CHIEFS assistant coach John Paintsil&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend is fuming.Malibongwe Gumede is demanding that the retired Ghanaian footballer pay back the R5 000 he owes her and her mum.&ldquo;Last year, when we were dating, he borrowed money (through me) from my mum to promote his soccer event that was supposed to take place,&rdquo; Malibongwe said.&ldquo;He told me he needed R10 000, but only asked for half of the money.&rdquo;The annoyed lass said she moved mountains to make sure the money was deposited into the footie&rsquo;s bank account.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been lying to me for the past eight months, saying he&rsquo;ll pay back the money,&rdquo; Malibongwe said.&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m really tired of begging him. I want to expose him. I have a recording of our conversations and proof of payment to back up my story.&rdquo;The SunTeam is in possession of the 7 May 2016 proof of payment slip of the money transferred to the Amakhosi assistant coach&rsquo;s account.When contacted for comment, John first denied the allegation, but later said he would pay back the Gumedes.&ldquo;Last year, I sent someone from Joburg to Durban in a bid to pay them, but they later told me they never received the money,&rdquo; John said.&ldquo;This is the third time they&rsquo;re asking for the same money.&rdquo;John said his ex&rsquo;s &ldquo;smear campaign&rdquo; may have been prompted by the fact that they were no longer an item.&ldquo;Let me tell you something my brother, you can&rsquo;t force someone to be in a relationship.&rdquo;He also lambasted Malibongwe&rsquo;s claims that their relationship came to an end as a result of him pursuing other women on Instagram.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big fat lie,&rdquo; John retorted.&ldquo;The reason we broke up was that she was sleeping with different men when she was drunk.&rdquo;Malibongwe strongly denied the allegations.Instagram was also where their relationship was allegedly forged last year in February.John then accused Malibongwe of being a &ldquo;backstabber&rdquo;. He told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;When I met her, I was dating my then girlfriend, whom I didn&rsquo;t know was her friend.&ldquo;But the whole time, she knew what she was doing.&rdquo;Cautioning his ex-lover, John said he had told her today&rsquo;s newspaper was tomorrow&rsquo;s toilet paper. John went on to say: &ldquo;My brother, this girl&rsquo;s got it all wrong. The R5 000 will not kill my career.&rdquo;
