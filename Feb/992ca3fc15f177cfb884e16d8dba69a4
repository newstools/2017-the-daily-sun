DEFENDING Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns could go to the top of the table tonight for the first time this season if they beat Chippa United at Loftus Versfeld (7.30pm). Downs are catching up on their fixture backlog after their triumph in the Caf Champions League, Caf Super Cup and representing Africa at the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan in December.A win for Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s champions will see them catch neighbours SuperSport United and Cape Town City on 35 points &ndash; BUT Downs will go top with a superior goal difference.The Brazilians, under Mosimane have been a revelation this season. And the coach has learnt to win ugly, thanks to their tough but successful Champions League campaign.But tonight Mosimane has promised to bring the beautiful game back to Loftus against the Chilli Boys.The teams met earlier this month and drew 1-1 in a mud-bath at East London&rsquo;s Sisa Dukashe Stadium.After that draw Mosimane said: &ldquo;We played bad football on a pitch that did not let us play. Under those circumstances we&rsquo;ll take the point.&rdquo;But Mosimane said it would be a different story at his team&rsquo;s Loftus fortress. His players have been on a roll at Loftus this month, defeating DR Congo giants TP Mazembe 1-0 to win the Super Cup, slaughtering Orlando Pirates 6-0 and beating title challengers Bidvest Wits 2-0 at the weekend.That&rsquo;s nine goals without reply in three matches at Loftus this month, so the Chilli Boys head coach Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela will be expecting an early onslaught.Former Downs star Malesela, who like Mosimane enjoys open, attacking football, should provide the fans with 90 minutes of competitive football.Downs are a treat to watch these days and Malesela&rsquo;s defenders, such as Justice Chabalala and Diamond Thobela, will be in for a night of hard work against Khama Billiat, Thapelo Morena, Leo Castro and Percy Tau &ndash; who has emerged as the find of the season. Tau played a big role in Downs&rsquo; conquering of Africa but has really shown his potential and class this year. He is destined for great things. He has the skills, pace and temperament to take his career to even greater heights. SEE PSL LOGS ON PAGE 23.
