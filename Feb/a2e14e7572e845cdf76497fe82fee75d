FIFTEEN families are living in run-down prefab houses, a stark contrast to the cosy RDPs of their neighbours.On top of this, these families will soon find themselves without a roof over their heads when Umzimvubu Local Municipality kicks them out.While the families involved are crying foul, the municipality said they had overstayed their welcome, and that most of them had other accommodation available.The families moved into the prefab houses in extension 7, KwaBhaca (formerly Mount Frere) four years ago.They claim they were left behind in the allocation of RDPs. When Daily Sun first reported on the 15 families&rsquo; plight, they said they had nowhere else to go.The municipality said it has been granted a court order to remove them. Municipal manager Thobile Nota said the municipality has been too patient with them.&ldquo;These families were given the houses as a temporary solution while they were advised to get themselves proper places to live in.&ldquo;Some of them even have RDP houses that they rent out. Others have homes in neighbouring villages, but they simply do not want to obey and leave in peace.&ldquo;Government does not allow us to provide people with temporary structures as permanent housing solutions. We made that clear to them, but they still refused to co- operate. We therefore took the matter to court and won,&rdquo; Nota said. Sinazo Vatsha (27), who lives in one of the prefab houses, said: &ldquo;Where must we go? We have stayed here for more than four years and we are unemployed.&rdquo; The residents have also illegally connected electricity and share a toilet they built themselves. They get water from the taps provided to the RDP houses.
