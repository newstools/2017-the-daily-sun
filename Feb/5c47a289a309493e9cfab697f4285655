A WAR of words erupted in Parliament yesterday when Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini again failed to arrive to answer questions over Sassa&rsquo;s readiness to pay grants.&nbsp; While ANC members defended her absence, opposition members of the social development portfolio committee spared little as they lashed the minister for being absent. Dlamini was supposed to inform Parliament about Sassa&rsquo;s readiness to issue grants after the expiry of the Cash Paymaster Services contract at the end of March. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damn disgrace. We don&rsquo;t accept her apology,&rdquo; said DA MP Lindy Wilson. ANC member Hope Malgas wouldn&rsquo;t take the assaults directed at Dlamini and told Wilson to keep quiet. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not honourable, she is a missus. I&rsquo;m sick of her,&rdquo; she said. Portfolio committee chairwoman Rose Capa intervened after a fierce exchange of words, saying it was members&rsquo; right to accept or reject the minister&rsquo;s apology, before asking Sassa officials to present their report. Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza and his team said their short term option was to keep the services of Cash Paymaster Services. Sassa indicated that it was planning to approach the Constitutional Court to allow the current service provider to continue to the end of the year. MPs were left frustrated, saying Sassa had not made any progress since their last meeting in November. Linda van der Merwe of the IFP asked how Sassa could ask for the contract of a company rejected by the Constitutional Court to be extended. Magwaza said: &ldquo;The decision has to be made. Come April&thinsp;1 grants have to be paid.&rdquo; Referring to Cash Paymaster Services, he said: &ldquo;The devil you know is often better than the angel you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
