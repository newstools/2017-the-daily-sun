DOGS will always be dogs. Even when you think you feed them enough, they will still want more. That is what madala Phineas Kobane (74) of Winterveld in Tshwane learnt on Monday morning.His dog, Sibi, came home dragging the body of a newborn baby from the nearby bush.Angry residents were left shocked and said they wished the baby&rsquo;s mother could be arrested and kept in jail.&ldquo;This is sick,&rdquo; said a woman at the scene. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who would do something like this. It is very sad. Someone would have loved that baby.&rdquo; Madala Phineas immediately called officials from the SPCA to remove the dog from his home.He said: &ldquo;I cannot live with a dog like that in my yard. It means it is dangerous. It could attack me one day and eat me alive.&rdquo;But inspector Meshack Matlou from the SPCA said the dog showed bravery and revealed the truth to the community. &ldquo;If it was not for this dog, no one would have known that a body was dumped there,&rdquo; he said.Matlou said they will find a good home for the dog.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Thembi Nowathe said the police found the baby&rsquo;s umbilical cord still attached to the body.&ldquo;The body was that of a boy and its stomach and part of the head was eaten by the dog,&rdquo; Nowathe said.
