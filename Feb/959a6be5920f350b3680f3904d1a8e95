IT SEEMS there is no end to the Esidimeni tragedy.&ldquo;We are struggling,&rdquo; the desperate nurses at Lenasia Community Clinic told Daily Sun.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t care for these patients.&rdquo;The People&rsquo;s Paper found 35 more patients who are stranded, this time at the health clinic in Lenasia, south of Joburg.These mentally ill patients were allegedly dumped at this hospital where they have no medication and rely on donated food for survival.Their families don&rsquo;t know where they are. A nurse at the hospital said they are scared the Esidimeni situation might happen at their facility.&ldquo;We only found out on Tuesday about the 35 patients who were brought to our hospital last Friday night,&rdquo; said a nurse.&ldquo;The facility manager said she was only told on Friday that patients were being transferred to our hospital.&rdquo;The nurse said they don&rsquo;t have the necessary skills for these patients.&ldquo;They are always locked in. What will happen to them if they get anxious?&rdquo;Thabo Masebe, Gauteng provincial spokesman, said the patients were transferred from an NGO as part of a plan that was implemented before the report.Masebe said there is a stigma about mentally ill patients.&ldquo;If the nurses claim to be qualified they have to manage. They should treat them like any other patients,&rdquo; he said.He said they were aware of shortages of food and medicine.&ldquo;Hospitals know what to do when they have shortages. If they ever go short, someone is neglecting their duties at the facility.&rdquo;Meanwhile, the Gauteng ANC Youth League has withdrawn charges against former MEC Qedani Mahlangu and their call for the premier David Makhura to resign after getting a tongue lashing from the ANC. Youth League chairman Matome Chiloane told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We still say those who are found guilty must face the full might of the law.&rdquo;
