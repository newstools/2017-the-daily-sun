We will stay in power for the next five years.”He urged his supporters not to pay attention to those who want the coalition to collapse.“Mongameli Bobani from the UDM is deputy mayor, and what is the problem? Don’t listen to confused people.“We’ll work with Bobani and Trollip to bring service delivery to the people on the ground. “I think there could be a coalition government at national level in 2019.”Holomisa said the UDM has to build strong branches and organise for its provincial and national congresses. “We must be ready for the general election in 2019,” he said.“I am warning leaders who are buying votes by bribing branches that all branches will be audited.”Bobani also spoke at the meeting.“The coalition government is going nowhere. We have a mandate and we are focusing on attending to the needs of the people,” he said.
