MAMELODI Sundowns became the second club in South Africa to win the African Super Cup after beating TP Mzembe 1-0 at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday night. The last time a South African team won the prestigious cup was 21 years ago when Orlando Pirates defeated Algerian side JS Kabylie 1-0 at FNB Stadium. Kaizer Chiefs also reached the finals of the Super Cup; however, they were thrashed 4-1 by Egyptian giants Al Ahly in Egypt at Cairo International Stadium. The annual match is played between CAF Champions League winners (Sundowns) and CAF Confederation Cup Champions (Mazembe). The Champions League winners are handed the home ground advantage. Brazilian-born Ricardo Nascimento converted a penalty in the 83rd minutes after Hlompho Kekana was brought down inside Mazembe&rsquo;s box to give the Brazilians that much needed win to clinch the Super Cup. Mazembe could have taken a lead before halftime but they were denied by an upright twice before Denis Onyango stopped the attack. Sundowns also had their fair chances with Anthony Laffor breaking in Mazembe&rsquo;s defence but goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo produced great saves to deny Laffor. Having failed to impress in the Club World Cup last yesterday December, Sundowns looked like a side that wanted to repay their fans by beating Mazembe.Sundowns have now added $100 000 prize (about R1&sbquo;3-million) from their last year&rsquo;s winnings.&nbsp;
