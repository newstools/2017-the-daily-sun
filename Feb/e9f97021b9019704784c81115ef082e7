MARITZBURG United will bring their A-game when they host Kaizer Chiefs in their Absa Premiership showdown at the Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm).New Team of Choice head coach Roger de Sa and his players were stung by a dubious, late penalty that saw them draw 1-1 with Polokwane City in Polokwane on Wednesday.Said De Sa: &ldquo;It was a dodgy penalty and that&rsquo;s putting it mildly. But there is no use going on about it. &ldquo;We had chances to kill off the game. We&rsquo;ve got to move on and try to get a big result against Chiefs.&rdquo;De Sa rates Amakhosi highly: &ldquo;They are without doubt title contenders and on fire right now. I watched them beat Free State Stars 3-1 midweek and they look good, especially Shabba (Siphiwe Tshabalala), who is on a high. So we will have to put the disappointment of dropping two points against Polokwane behind us and move on.&rdquo;De Sa will be minus veteran defender Bevan Fransman, who like his skipper Kurt Lentjies is suspended.Said De Sa: &ldquo;I have some really good youngsters that I&rsquo;m blooding. But Chiefs will be a huge test, as will our next match away to leaders SuperSport United (22 February).&rdquo;De Sa is targeting a top eight position: &ldquo;I reckon the top six places are already booked, but I believe we can squeeze in at seventh or eight position.&rdquo; Amakhosi head coach Steve Komphela is wary of his former club: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s important to us is to stay with the pack. You cannot afford to drop points at this stage.&ldquo;New coach Roger de Sa went in there and had about four weeks to work with the team. He obviously did some business during the window period. &ldquo;You prepare yourself as well as you can but you cannot plan against them, as you don&rsquo;t have the information. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;d better be on our toes.&rdquo;
