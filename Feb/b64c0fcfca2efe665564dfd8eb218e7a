OVER the years, a considerable number of women have undergone sterilisation to stop having more children.Female sterilisation includes two main procedures: the tubal ligation, where clips are placed on the fallopian tubes and the tubal occlusion, where a tiny, flexible device is placed into each tube.And men are having their own tubes tied up, which is called vasectomy.The Medical Dictionary defines this as a surgical procedure performed on males: the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles are cut, tied or cauterised (burned or seared).These forms of permanent female and male contraception are now becoming a choice for most couples.Soweto-based gynaecologist Dr George Koboka said most women who consider sterilisation are based in urban areas.&ldquo;They have more information and options, compared to their rural counterparts.&ldquo;Some of the most common reasons why women opt for sterilisation include the number of kids they already have, plus medical conditions like diabetes and high-blood pressure, among other reasons,&rdquo; he said.For Mampho Makitla (*not her real name) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, she said she went for sterilisation because she&rsquo;s a single mum of five children.She said: &ldquo;I tried keeping men by having their babies. Now, I&rsquo;m left with five kids and raising them alone. And it&rsquo;s not easy.&ldquo;Whoever comes to me right now should understand that building a future with me doesn&rsquo;t involve having kids.&rdquo;&nbsp;She said it&rsquo;s due to a lack of knowledge that she had the procedure in her 40s. Otherwise, she said she could have stopped at baby number three.For Margaret Bush (*not her real name) from Florida, in Gauteng, she said she was hurt when she found out her husband had a vasectomy without her permission.&ldquo;My hubby grew up in a coastal town and he had such fun growing up. So, for him having one child is enough.&rdquo;Said Margaret: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve spoken about me going for sterilisation many times, but I never seem to make time to go. He went ahead and told me after the procedure was done he&rsquo;d had a vasectomy.&rdquo;They only have one child and although at times she thinks their child is lonely, she looks at the good quality of life they afford her &ndash; and understands where her husband was coming from.Dr Koboka said he hasn&rsquo;t encountered a vasectomy patient. This he attributes to the fact that men can be secretive.And because they want to avoid the societal shame that comes with people knowing they might be sterile.&ldquo;With female sterilisation a majority of women are white. When she has a problem with her uterus, a white woman is more likely to have it removed to prevent cancer and/or other illnesses, but most black women don&rsquo;t do this.&ldquo;Culturally, black women still believe they have to die with all their body organs still intact,&rdquo; he said.Dr Koboka urges people to get educated in matters of reproductive health. He also encourages health practitioners to spread awareness about sterilisation as an effective and permanent family planning method.
