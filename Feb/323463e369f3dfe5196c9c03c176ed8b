Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala has revealed he still has hopes of once again representing Bafana Bafana at international level.The 32-year-old has played 88 times for the South Africa although his last call up to the national team set up was in 2015. During his time with Bafana, Tshabalala has banged in 12 goals.However, despite his advancing years, Shabba takes the view that he still has a role to play. He told reporters: "I'd still love to play for the national team. I've enjoyed every minute of representing my country, and I'm not going to put any pressure."I just want to keep working hard for my team and if that opportunity comes then I'll definitely grab it with both my hands, but no pressure. I think football nowadays is not only about talent. It's about brains and hard work as well, and that completes a player."I played as an attacking midfielder and I was switched to the left-hand side as well. I dropped deep to manage the game, and I'm happy that I can play more than three or four positions. It's about timing...it's about experience as to how to manage the game - when to run with the ball, when to slow down, and when to use your speed as well."
