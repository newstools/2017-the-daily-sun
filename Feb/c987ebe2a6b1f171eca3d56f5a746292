CARING cops from Pinetown, north of Durban have encouraged primary school pupils to report crime.The cops on Thursday held a safer schools campaign at the Pinetown Civic Centre where hundreds of pupils from various kasi schools surrounding Pinetown gathered. Warrant Officer Muzi Maphumulo, the communications officer at the Pinetown cop shop, told Daily Sun that it is their responsibility to keep children safe and to educate them on their rights. &ldquo;This is an ongoing back to school campaign by Icebolethu Funeral Services, where they donate school materials and lunch to children from various schools. &ldquo;We decided to partner with them because we care about the children&rsquo;s safety. We educate them on their rights through talks.&rdquo; Maphumulo said there are criminal acts that kids, especially at primary school level, are not aware of.&ldquo;We taught them not to be lured with sweets and other gifts by strangers since human trafficking is increasing in the country. &ldquo;We also encouraged them to report any form of physical abuse, such as being touched in sensitive parts.&rdquo; Akhona Dlamini (9) from KwaManzini Junior Primary School said: &ldquo;We were taught to report abuse even if it is our teacher who touches us on our sensitive parts.&rdquo;Icebolethu owner Nomfundo Mcoyi-Bhengu said their back to school campaign also aims to assist needy schools with donations of equipment such as computers.
