Anele said the service would start around 7.30am at Lundi&rsquo;s house, before heading to the stadium at 9am.Anele said Lundi would be laid to rest at the Zwelithemba cemetery.&ldquo;The only disappointment is that there are some people who are trying to tarnish Lundi&rsquo;s reputation, even when he is no more.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still appealing to them to leave the family to mourn and bury him in peace &ndash; instead of focusing on negative issues,&rdquo; said Anele. Sechaba said he arrived early in Cape Town so he could attend the memorial service in Lundi&rsquo;s hometown. &ldquo;I know many artists are arriving later because there was an accom-modation shortage when I arrived.&ldquo;Many places were fully booked on Friday and I couldn&rsquo;t get myself a car because rentals had ran out of cars at the airport,&rdquo; he said.Sechaba said he was impressed by the attendance at the memorial service in Worcester.&ldquo;It was packed, just like in Joburg. The community came out in large numbers &ndash; which shows they loved Lundi,&rdquo; said Sechaba.But he said there were not too many celebrities at Lundi&rsquo;s memorial service in Worcester.
