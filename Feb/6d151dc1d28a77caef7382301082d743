THE MOTHERWELL Business Forum wants tenders in Nelson Mandela Bay to be awarded fairly. The forum accused Councillor Mambalu Mgcokoca of giving tenders to her friends and fellow politicians. On Monday morning, members of the forum held a meeting with the councillor at her office in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth.The forum wanted to know who she had awarded her latest tender to.Fezile Zwide, an organiser at the forum, claimed: &ldquo;The councillor recommends the tenders be managed by members of her ANC branch committee. &ldquo;She refuses to involve any of our members when she makes a decision. We were also told she allowed two unknown businesses to work in our ward without our knowledge.&rdquo; Mgcokoca said: &ldquo;I cannot approve any tender without consulting them. &ldquo;I am always careful not to let political agendas interfere with business. The council still has to elect ward committee members. &ldquo;Once the committees have been established, a member of the council&rsquo;s economic development unit will be chosen to represent the business forum.&rdquo;
