MOTORISTS can&rsquo;t drive through this street and children are warned to stay away!The street in eMahashe, Despatch, near Nelson Mandela Bay has not been named yet but the dirty water in it has made gatvol residents call it &ldquo;Green Street&rdquo;. For over two years, the street has been threatening to swallow children because beneath the green grass is a deep dam of stinking sewage! Worried resident Xolani Meke (36) said: It looks like attractive grass but you can&rsquo;t cross it. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s hot, our children want to swim in it!&rdquo;Residents said the sounds of singing choirs of frogs and buzzing mosquitoes keep them up at night.At least 179 RDPs are currently under construction in the newly developed area.&ldquo;Officials from the municipality just came and stared at it and left. Maybe they think it is impossible to repair. We breathe in kak every day.&rdquo; Ward 41 Councillor Simphiwe Tyukana said: &ldquo;I have a number of references as I&rsquo;ve been reporting the matter to the municipality for many years.The problem started with the company that conducted the underground infrastructure in 2010. The project was then handed over to the municipality. It is now their problem to handle. &rdquo;Mthubanzi Mniki, Nelson Mandela Bay&rsquo;s municipal spokesman, said: &ldquo;This issue will be followed up with the relevant department.&rdquo; It is always better when a case is reported and a reference number given. In that way we are able to trace progress. We will do the same with this query.&rdquo;
