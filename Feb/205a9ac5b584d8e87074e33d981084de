EGYPT&rsquo;S 44-year-old goalkeeper Essam El Hadary saved two spot-kicks as the seven-time champions reached the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) final by edging Burkina Faso 4-3 on penalties on Wednesday.El Hadary saved the last two kicks by Burkina Faso after Egypt had squandered their opening shot and looked to be on their way out of the tournament.The oldest player to compete at a major championship stopped penalty shots from Herve Koffi and Bertrand Traore.The match ended in a 1-1 draw after Mohamed Salah handed Egypt a 66th-minute lead but Burkina pulled level seven minutes later through Aristide Bance.Egypt, on course for a record-extending eighth title, were set to discover the identity of their opponents in Sunday&rsquo;s final in Libreville last night when Ghana and Cameroon&rsquo;s semifinal clash were played in Franceville.Wednesday&rsquo;s result was a cruel blow to the Burkinabe, who were the more adventurous team but could not put away their chances.They were forced to come back after Egypt snatched the lead through Salah with a superb curling shot into the top corner at the end of a rare attack.Egypt, who had not conceded a goal in the tournament, finally had their defences breached when a clever back-heel from Steeve Yago and a chip from captain Charles Kabore was swept home from close range by Bance.El Hadary, who won titles in 1998, 2006, 2008 and 2010, was kept busy in the game, particularly in the closing stages, making a fine stop from Traore&rsquo;s free kick and tipping over an effort from Banou Diawara on the stroke of full time.&ldquo;We knew it would be difficult because Burkina Faso were powerful and very quick. They were much fitter than us. They were even better in the second half, with aggressive attacking. They wasted so many chances,&rdquo; Egypt coach Hector Cuper told reporters.&ldquo;Our players were fatigued so we aimed for penalties because anything can happen there.&rdquo;Said Burkina Faso coach Paulo Duarte: &ldquo;We should have won because we showed skill, stamina and determination &ndash; and we had the opportunities.&rdquo; &ndash; REUTERS
