THE courthouse will be packed &ndash; mostly with the accused!A group of 41 suspects &ndash; 30 men and 11 women between the ages of 26 and 76 &ndash; are due to appear in the Elliotdale Magistrates Court today to face charges of kidnapping a 34-year-old man. The suspects were arrested at Ntlonyane village on Wednesday afternoon after police received a tip-off that a man had been taken by them by force. Cops arrived at the scene to find community members surrounding the man, whom they had accused of stealing chickens in the village.When the cops tried to intervene, the community members blocked them, and they had to call for backup from other police stations. All the suspects were then arrested on the spot. Police said they found no evidence linking the victim to the community&rsquo;s theft allegation. Angry villagers told Daily Sun the alleged chicken thief&rsquo;s parents should pay for his sins.Local chief Dumalitshona Sirhunu claimed the man had been linked to thefts that were happening in the area. &ldquo;I did not take part in this incident and do not condone it,&rdquo; the chief said. &ldquo;However, we are not happy with the way police officers have handled the matter.&ldquo;We have been raising our frustrations through the station commander for a long time.&rdquo; Police spokesman Major Zamukulungisa Jozana said the community should not take the law into their own hands, because that alone would nullify any initial case against the suspect. He said cops would hold a meeting at Ntlonyane in the coming week to help discourage vigilantism in the area.He said people should inform police immediately if anyone was suspected of doing something wrong, instead of assaulting possibly innocent people. The victim was released because nobody laid a charge of theft against him.
