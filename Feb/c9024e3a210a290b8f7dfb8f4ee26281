Orlando Pirates full-back Thabo Matlaba says he is not concerned by his imminent rivalry with Marc van Heerden for the left-back position.Van Heerden recently moved to Bucs from Chippa United as part of a swap deal which saw Justice Chabalala, Donald Makondolela and Sello Japhta move in the opposite direction on loan spells.The 28-year-old has previously been linked with a move to Gauteng's Big Three prior his Chippa move in the off-season, but Pirates won the race for his signature."Marc is a hardworking, quality fullback, who will undoubtedly bring vast experience to the team's defence. Of course, his presence will also give a bit more competition in the team's left-back position," Matlaba told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."That means there will be more competition between me, Patrick (Phungwayo) and Marc for a starting berth, which means a healthy competition in a team."Look, I'm a professional and believe in my ability as a player, so I'm always ready for competition, because competition is a name of the game. Yes, I am a regular at the team's left-back position, but that doesn't mean I should treat any new player with whom I will compete for a position as a threat."So, I treat Marc along with James (Okwuosa) as the ones who will be adding value at our team's defence," he added.Bucs will resume Absa Premiership campaign by taking on Platinum Stars at Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg on Wednesday.
