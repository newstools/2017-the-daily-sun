IT TOOK Edwin Bosilong 10 years to complete his dream house. But a team from the sheriff&rsquo;s office needed just one day to flatten it all!This was after Edwin&rsquo;s piece of land was apparently given to another man, who got the court&rsquo;s permission to evict Edwin.Edwin (48), from Setumo Park in Mahikeng, North West blames the Barolong Boora Tshidi Tribal Authority for the mess.His dreams of building a proper house for his family started taking shape in 2003 when he requested a stand from the tribal office. &ldquo;I was offered a stand as I said I wanted to build a house. According to the tribal authority, if you are allocated a stand and you do not develop it in six months, the stand will be taken away and offered to the next person,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;A month later, I built a shack on the stand.&rdquo;Then in 2005, Edwin said he started building his house. In 2015, the house was just about finished.Edwin told Daily Sun that Thabo Rankokwadi visited him in 2015, and told him the stand belonged to him.Edwin said he reported the matter to the tribal authority for mediation, fearing he could lose his nine-roomed house. &ldquo;I was summoned to court but I lost the case because the tribal authority had failed to give me the title deed for the stand. On Friday, I got a call from my neighbours while I was at work. They told me my house had been demolished. My wife fainted when she arrived at the house and found it knocked to the ground. We were not informed of the demolition and we have lost everything,&rdquo; he said.Rankokwadi said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asking Bosilong to move, but he refused. &ldquo;I have a valid title deed.&rdquo; Kgosi Magatlapane Tawana said they told Edwin to move out, but he refused. Community members assisted Edwin to build a shack on Sunday.
