TAXI drivers and owners are not happy about the bad smell at Port Alfred Taxi Rank in the Port Alfred CBD.Taximan Zukisa Faliteni said they have been complaining about the blocked toilets to Ndlambe Municipality, but no one listens. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been three months since we&rsquo;ve had this kak smell, but it seems the municipality doesn&rsquo;t want to resolve the matter.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t work at this rank!&rdquo; Taxi owner Sipho Zikode said they are worried about the health of their drivers and passengers.&ldquo;The municipality should at least consider the people we are transporting because it&rsquo;s clear they don&rsquo;t care about us.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Khululekile Mbolekwa said: Taximen did report the matter and we sent our workers to resolve the matter. &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t know that the problem was not completely resolved.&ldquo;The problem might be that the pipes are too small. But we will send people who deal with pipes to check what is really causing the problem. All we are asking for is time to resolve the matter. We are aware that no one can work under such conditions.&rdquo;
