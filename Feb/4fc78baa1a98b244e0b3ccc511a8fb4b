THE results of Mzansi&rsquo;s latest sex survey show that more and more men and women have found joy with a toy!The sex toy industry survey, conducted among 700 men and women by Desir, revealed that while Mzansi adults were definitely sexually active, about 76,7% of them used a sex toy.The steaming results revealed Mzansi&rsquo;s appetite for adult toys has increased and that more are turning to the tried and tested to achieve orgasm.The survey also showed that nearly three-quarters of the respondents had sex multiple times a week, or at least five times a month. The vast majority (94%) said they were sure to reach orgasm when using a sex toy. The CEO of Desir, Brodie Meyer, said most of the respondents used sex toys and that the biggest reason for people not using them was because they were ignorant about the choice available and what sex toys could do for them.&ldquo;People feel too embarrassed or ashamed to use them. Most people also buy their sex toys online, rather than going to a &lsquo;brick and mortar&rsquo; store,&rdquo; he said.Brodie said non-users of sex toys indicated they&rsquo;d consider buying a sex toy for use as a couple (64,4%) rather than for solo use, and that nearly a quarter of them (24,2%) admitted they did not get enough sex, with many of them saying the quality of their sexual relations could be improved.
