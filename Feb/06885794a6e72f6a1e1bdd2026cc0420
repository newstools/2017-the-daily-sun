MAMI Sefitlholo (37) wanted to surprise her congregation with a special Valentine&rsquo;s Day event.Last month she asked the church to reserve Saturday for a feast. But her plans didn&rsquo;t work out well because she died last Monday. That didn&rsquo;t stop the church from having the function in her honour on Saturday.Red drinks and snacks were part of the belated Valentine&rsquo;s event celebrated in style by the AME Church in Bekkersdal, west of Joburg.Shortly after Mami was lowered into the grave, the church invited residents to share lunch and celebrate and dance into the early hours of Sunday.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will and we don&rsquo;t have the power to change that,&rdquo; said the priest, Charlotte Mudau. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad losing a woman we loved so much. I think Mami&rsquo;s message was for us to preach words of love.&rdquo;Church member Peter Ratsoeu (49) said: &ldquo;Mami was very active in the church. &ldquo;We thank the EFF for their support in helping to bury her with dignity.&rdquo;Olebogeng Seokamo (48), a member of the men&rsquo;s group in the church, said: &ldquo;Mami was aiming to launch the Women&rsquo;s Missionary Society in April, but her plans were spoiled by death.&rdquo;Mami&rsquo;s gogo, Zodwa Seshabela (73), told Daily Sun: &ldquo;For the church to honour Mami&rsquo;s last wish is a positive action that brings strength to the congregation.&rdquo;
