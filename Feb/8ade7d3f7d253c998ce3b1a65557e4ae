THE 2016-17 MultiChoice Diski Challenge season could be decided in the penultimate matches this weekend.Bloemfontein Celtic and Mamelodi Sundowns are the teams with the best chance of bagging the title, as they are first and second in the table with 30 and 28 points respectively. Sundowns suffered a setback when the PSL announced that a point had been deducted from their tally for fielding a suspended player, Thabang Sibanyoni, against Chippa United in December last year.Celtic take on Ajax Cape Town in the Umlazi festival at King Zwelithini Stadium tomorrow (10am), while the young Brazilians will be up against on-form Kaizer Chiefs at the same venue on Sunday (1pm).If Celtic defeat Ajax tomorrow and Sundowns lose to Chiefs on Sunday, Siwelele will be on their way to the Netherlands, as they will be crowned the new champions of the Diski Challenge after the final round of fixtures on 25 February. The MDC champions win a trip to the Netherlands for a four-day training camp at the Royal Netherlands Football Association. Third-placed Bidvest Wits are also still in the race, mathematically.Celtic coach Duncan Lechesa told SunSport there was pressure on them now but they would handle it. &ldquo;The pressure won&rsquo;t affect our performance. The boys know what is at stake, they can&rsquo;t afford any slip-ups.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Wits coach Glen Salmon admits that only a miracle will see them win the title at this stage. Wits will only triumph if both Celtic and Sundowns lose their games this weekend. Wits play Free State Stars at Goble Park on Sunday (10am).&ldquo;We have not thrown in the towel yet. Our chances of winning the league are slim now. We can only hope the two top teams lose their respective fixures, that will put us back in the race,&rdquo; said Salmon.
