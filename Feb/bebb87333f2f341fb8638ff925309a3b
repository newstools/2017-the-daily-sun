SINGLE MOTHERS always get the credit for raising their kids, but there&rsquo;s a growing number of single fathers who are raising their children too.This number is steadily growing and fathers are now becoming primary givers due to reasons like death of the mum, the father being the financially stable one after a divorce and able to give their kids the best life, among other issues.According to the book, South African Child Gauge 2015, 28,4% of children aged 13 to 19 live with their fathers, and from 0 to 12 years a total of 32,2% live with their fathers.Thabo Maleka (not his real name) from North Riding in Joburg, he said he chose to raise his eight-year-old son as he was better suited to provide him with a better quality of life and education.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t married to his mum. And after we separated, both families agreed that I&rsquo;m the better suited parent to live with my son.&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t easy at first, as he comes to me with everything from homework, to issues with his friends to his needs. My helper really helped me a lot, and now I have a grip on things,&rdquo; he said.Thabo said what helped him most was that his son&rsquo;s mum had access to his home anytime &ndash; because he didn&rsquo;t want his son to feel he had no access to his mum.&ldquo;My partner knows my son comes first. Her insecurity doesn&rsquo;t have to revolve around our boy&rsquo;s wellbeing. The situation makes things easy for my son and I,&rdquo; he said.Lekau Matla from Pretoria North said he lost his wife when his daughters were aged four and two, respectively.Although his family asked to raise his daughters, he said being with them while they were getting over the loss of their mum made their healing process easier.&ldquo;Some days we cried together.Other days they wore her clothes, and although they were young, they ended up understanding they would never see their mother ever again.&ldquo;Both my family and their maternal family help me a lot during school holidays and weekends, and we&rsquo;ve all found our rhythm,&rdquo; he said.Lekau said he worried about the future, when the girls start dating and asking questions about menstruation, and how their female bodies were developing.But he said he trusted his extended family support system to help him when the need arose.He points out that it&rsquo;s not easy &ndash;&nbsp;because he has no one to unload his emotional issues on.But he also admits that after four years as a single, he is now starting to think about dating.
