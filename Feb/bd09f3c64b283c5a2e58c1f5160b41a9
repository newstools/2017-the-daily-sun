Wits looked deadly from the whistle go, with Elias Pelembe and Gabadhino Mhango creating goal scoring chances but failed to convert. However, their luck came in the 30th minutes when defender Buhle Mkhwanazi headed-on on close range to give the home side a lead. Daine Klate, who turn 32-years-old on Saturday was also on the score sheet when he converted the &nbsp;second goal for the Clever Boys with eight minutes to go before halftime. Returning on the hot seat for Baroka was Coach Kgoloko Thobejane, who was hoping to turn things around after Coach Jacob Sakala was suspended by the club.&nbsp; But Wits were just too strong for the Limpopo based team. &nbsp;Mkhwanazi bagged his brace in the second half with a header while Christantus Uzoenyi , on his debut scored for Wits to make it 4-0. Sensational youngster Phakamani &nbsp;Mahlambi worsened the situation for Thobejane&rsquo;s charges when he scored the fifth goal for the home.
