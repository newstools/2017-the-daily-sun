THE FIFTH and final one-day international against Sri Lanka in Centurion today could see the Proteas regain their No 1 position in the ICC ODI team rankings.This comes after current leaders Australia lost their three-match series 2-0 to New Zealand.A whitewash against Sri Lanka will see the Proteas leapfrog Australia and head to New Zealand &ndash; and possibly England for the Champions Trophy &ndash; as the No 1-ranked ODI side.&ldquo;Five-nil is important in order to get to No 1,&rdquo; Faf du Plessis said. &ldquo;For a while we&rsquo;ve been targeting getting back to the top in all formats and we&rsquo;re getting there very quickly.&ldquo;Five-nil will be a great achievement, no matter who you play against. A lot of the teams will take the foot off the gas, but we&rsquo;re been really good throughout this series.&rdquo;Despite this series being a one-sided affair, Du Plessis says they&rsquo;ve learnt to become more consistent and not let their opponents get ahead at any moment. &ldquo;You have to beat who is in front of you, I think that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ve done really well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been consistent throughout the series, we haven&rsquo;t taken our foot off the gas.&ldquo;Our batsmen have been disciplined and from a bowling point of view &ndash; yes, Sri Lanka are not the best batting lineup to bowl to, but we&rsquo;re still doing what&rsquo;s required.&rdquo;The Proteas bowling attack was under pressure at New&shy;lands on Tuesday for the first time this ODI series. The match saw a flurry of runs and a solid opening partnership of 139 between Niroshan Dickwella and skipper Upul Tharanga. Wayne Parnell took 4-58 as the Proteas bowlers dug deep to wrap up their 13th consecutive home win.&ldquo;That was a pressured situation, we know they score runs on top and the bowlers didn&rsquo;t start off well, but they came back,&rdquo; said Du Plessis.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that as a bowling unit we get pushed, especially a young bowling unit. That&rsquo;s the difference between winning a tournament and not &ndash; the pressure.&rdquo;The final ODI starts at 1.30pm.The Proteas travel to New Zealand tomorrow and will play their first T20 international against the Black Caps on 17 February. &ndash; SPORT24
