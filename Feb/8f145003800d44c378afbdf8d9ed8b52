WHEN clouds gathered and the thunder started rumbling, the terrified cows, donkeys and goats ran for shelter.But the abandoned rondavel didn&rsquo;t save them. With a loud bang, two cows, 10 goats and a donkey were struck dead.Now the animals&rsquo; owners from Mfolozi Village in Tsolo, near Mthatha, are shocked following the storm on Sunday night.Farmer Mbongeni Khuthukwayo (53) said: &ldquo;We have lost our source of income. Our livestock is lying dead in the rondavel.&rdquo;Mbongeni said he lost five goats which he was hoping to sell very soon so he could pay for his child&rsquo;s university fees. A single goat can fetch as much as R1 500.Another sad farmer, Philiswa Mcamba (54), lost two cows she was keeping for umgidi for her sons in June. She had already sent invitations to friends and relatives but now both her cows are dead. She can&rsquo;t afford to buy more as she and the other farmers are all unemployed.This is the second storm to cause damage at Tsolo since last Monday.Ward councillor Thando Mgaweni said it was sad that people had lost so much in the blink of an eye. &ldquo;At this stage I cannot confirm whether the municipality will compensate them for their loss. &ldquo;I sent a report and hope to get information that I will explain to the farmers. They are all unemployed and survive on social grants.&rdquo;
