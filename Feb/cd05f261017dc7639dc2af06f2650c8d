LAWYERS for Human Rights are urging residents not to take part in the coming march against illegal immigrants.It held a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday.Organisation candidate attorney Mametlwe Sebei said the march will spark even more violence.He accused Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba of planting the idea of immigrants being the cause of unemployment and crime in Mzansi, saying there wouldn&rsquo;t be hatred had he not done so.Sebei said Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga will also be held accountable if he allows the march to go ahead on Friday.Congolese community spokesman Prince Mpinda said he fears for his life. He pleaded with residents to condemn the march, because not all immigrants are involved in crime.&ldquo;We are afraid to walk or use public transport because people might attack us. I regret coming to South Africa, but since I have built a life here I have to weather the storm. &ldquo;On 28 February, we will also march, against xenophobia. We need to build unity to end crime.&rdquo; Mamelodi residents plan to march on Friday and accuse foreigners of occupying land and houses in the area illegally.At the weekend, Pretoria West residents burnt foreigners&rsquo; belongings, houses and vehicles.On Monday, violence broke out in Atteridgeville when residents looted over 30 foreign-owned shops. Last week, a government delegation was sent to Rosettenville, Joburg after residents attacked Nigerians, saying they are central to crime, drugs and prostitution in the area. Mpinda said a WhatsApp account is available for foreigners affected by xenophobic attacks, and *120*8864*1538# can be dialled to join the group.
