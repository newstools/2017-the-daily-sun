We want to catch Chelsea and so it's important to put pressure on them," Kane is quoted as saying by the&nbsp;Times of India."I think they are [catchable]. It is nine points - it's only three games. In the Premier League no game is easy and Chelsea know that. They are in good form but all we can do is win our games and see what happens."Hopefully they will drop a few points.
