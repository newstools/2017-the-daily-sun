IGAGASI High School pupils clashed with their principal yesterday when he allegedly refused to let them into the school because they did not have schoolbags with the school&rsquo;s logo on them.The pupils from U section in Umlazi then took to the streets, bringing the area to a standstill. They told Daily Sun they were only told about the schoolbags two weeks ago.A grade 10 pupil said: &ldquo;The principal said he won&rsquo;t allow us into school if we didn&rsquo;t have the bags with the logo by today. So we chose to disrupt classes.&rdquo;Parent Zodwa Shange (42) from Malukazi said she was forced to borrow money from a mashonisa.&ldquo;The bags cost R135 each for my two children. I feel the principal doesn&rsquo;t work with the parents because he should have asked us what the right time would be to implement the rule.&rdquo; Principal Patrick Tenze defended his decision, saying: &ldquo;The branded Nike and Adidas bags the pupils carry are causing havoc.&ldquo;The bags get stolen or sold in nearby schools and the real owners storm the school, going straight to the classrooms to attack those who have their bags.&rdquo; &ldquo;Forcing pupils to buy designed bags will help us overcome this problem,&rdquo; said the principal. The principal &ndash; who joined the school in November &ndash; said he thought this was a solution to the problem.KZN Education Department spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said as much as they understand the principal&rsquo;s effort to address the problem, not all parents can get money so quickly.&ldquo;We ask him to give them an extended period of time to do what is expected of them.&rdquo;He emphasised that having a schoolbag designed by the school was not compulsory.&ldquo;Even though we fully understand the reason behind the principal&rsquo;s call, pupils cannot be forced to comply and put their education at risk,&rdquo; said Mlotshwa.
