SOUTH African speedster Henricho Bruintjies says he is eyeing back-to-back SA sprint titles and is also determined to defend his 100m title at the SA Senior Championships in Potchefstroom in April.The 2016 Rio Olympian, who trains with Mzansi&rsquo;s fastest man, Akani Simbine, is on a mission to retain his title. The 23-year-old made waves in athletics circles last year when he broke the 10 seconds barrier to capture the domestic title in 9.97 sec.He wants to be a leading contender in all the events he will be competing in this season. Bruintjies, who is coached by Hennie Kriel, is also hoping to compete at the IAAF World Championships in London, England, later this year. The young athlete started training in December to prepare for the new season. His first race will take place at a club meeting at the University of Pretoria on 2 March. He will also conduct coaching clinics with aspiring athletes in Ruimsig, north of Joburg, today. The top five performances at the event are awarded a one-year contract by sponsors Puma. Bruintjies said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for athletes to attract a sponsor. We struggle to get funding and that makes it hard for us. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that my sponsors are taking care of me and I want to make them proud this season. I want to become a contender and put in the extra work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the same level as my training partner Akani &ndash; it&rsquo;s just amazing to train with him every day.&rdquo;Bruintjies competed at his first Olympics in Brazil last year but the stage proved just too big for him on debut. He insists he learned a lot and said he would use the experience of rubbing shoulders with Olympic superstar Usain Bolt as a learning experience for upcoming world major events. This year his focus is on the World Champs and next year he&rsquo;s aiming for the Commonwealth Games in Australia.
