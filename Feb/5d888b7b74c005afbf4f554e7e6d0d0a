NEIGHBOURS are still in shock after five members of the same family were killed in their flat on Monday night. When the cops arrived on the scene, the bodies were found lying in the bedroom. Only one child thought to be about three years old survived the brutal attack. Gauteng cops have launched a manhunt for those responsible for killing the three women and two children in the block of flats in Claim Street, Hillbrow in Joburg. The police said there could be a reward for information about the suspects&rsquo; whereabouts. Captain Mavela Masondo said the attackers entered the victims&rsquo; flat and shot all of them in the upper body. &ldquo;The motive for this gruesome murder is unknown and police are investigating five cases of murder.&rdquo; Residents in the area said they have been living in fear since the incident. A neighbour told Daily Sun he heard the gunshots that killed the family. &ldquo;I heard the shots but didn&rsquo;t know if the people in the room were being killed. I didn&rsquo;t want to check.&ldquo;It was scary to hear guns being fired.&rdquo; In the small room where the shooting took place, a bloodstained blanket could be seen, as well as blood splattered around the room. Security guards at the flats said they didn&rsquo;t hear the shots. Masondo asked anyone with information about the incident to contact the police on 08600 10111 or to SMS Crime Line on 32211.
