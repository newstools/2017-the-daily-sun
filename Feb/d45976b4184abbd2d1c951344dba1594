FOR months, Tebogo Setlagole was haunted by rats, until one day a cat arrived from nowhere.Tebogo was grateful his ancestors had sent the cat because the animal controlled the rats.But it seems the cat has lost the battle. On Wednesday when Tebogo came back home to Soul City squatter camp, Mogale City, the cat didn&rsquo;t come to greet him as usual.&ldquo;I was surprised. I called the cat but it didn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I immediately knew something was wrong.&rdquo;He said that when he looked under his bed, he found the cat was dead and had wounds that looked like rat bites.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartbroken. I loved this cat. I looked after it and it looked after me.&rdquo;Residents of Soul City said rats are a problem in their area.&ldquo;They breed in the dumps and come into our homes. It&rsquo;s a challenge because this place is dirty. These rats are clever. They don&rsquo;t eat poison any more,&rdquo; said a resident.&ldquo;Some people use traps, but the clever rats don&rsquo;t come close because they know it means death.&rdquo;Residents said they thought the cats would help to control the rats.&ldquo;But now it seems the rats are even overpowering cats,&rdquo; said another resident.Community leader Terror Mphoselwa said they have residents who always clean the dumps, but it is difficult.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have the right equipment and the rubbish ends up piling up. &ldquo;We hope the municipality will help us get rid of the rats,&rdquo; said Terror.
