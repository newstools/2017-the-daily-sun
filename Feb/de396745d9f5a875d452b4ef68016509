HIP HOP star, Kwesta, is rumoured to be off the market.&nbsp;This comes after it emerged that the Ngud&rsquo; hitmaker will be performing a traditional ritual known as Umembeso for his baby mama and girlfriend of seven years, Yolanda Mvelase.&nbsp;Umembeso is allegedly expected to take place on 8 March.&nbsp;The rapper, whose real name is Mfundo Vilakazi, is said to be very eager for the ceremony, which is seen as a stepping stone to marrying his long-time girlfriend.&nbsp;A source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;They enjoy each other&rsquo;s company and nothing means more to Kwesta than being a proud family man.&nbsp;&ldquo;He has proven time and time again that he&rsquo;s a responsible dad.&nbsp;&ldquo;He loves his daughter, Khai, and Yolanda too. You can even see the way he blushes every time he&rsquo;s asked about his relationship or when he talks about them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Another source said the Mvelases, who are based in Westville outside Durban, in KZN, are excited about the event.&nbsp;&ldquo;Yolanda&rsquo;s dad is so excited. He told one of his friends he can&rsquo;t wait for &ldquo;Ngud&rdquo; (referring to Kwesta) to make it official.&nbsp;&ldquo;When Kwesta is off, he spends most of his time in Durban to be with his girlfriend and daughter.&nbsp;&ldquo;When he&rsquo;s not with Yolanda and Khai, he visits his old friend, Zakwe.&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait to go there and have a good time, since we&rsquo;ve already received our invites,&rdquo; the second source said.&nbsp;Yolanda&rsquo;s dad, Vusi Mvelase, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get involved in children&rsquo;s business. Speak to those who are involved first, then call me afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp;Kwesta was not available for comment, but his manager, Leroy Khoza, promised to respond within 10 minutes but failed to do so.&nbsp;Yolanda could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;
