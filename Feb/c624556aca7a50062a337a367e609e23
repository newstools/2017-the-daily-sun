The handover took place at Butterworth Town Hall, and more than 60 people received blankets. Bathabile Pikela, spokeswoman for the association, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Today we are helping poor people in our area. &ldquo;We are also assisting fellow hawkers who are struggling. &ldquo;We bought the blankets with money from our own pockets.&ldquo;Butterworth is one of the coldest places in winter, so that&rsquo;s why we decided to donate the blankets.&rdquo; Bathabile said they would like to do more for the community, and would appreciate help from local businesses.&ldquo;We would appreciate it if business people could help us change the lives of the poor for the better.&rdquo; Hawker Novusumzi Mpisana (42) said she was grateful to the association for giving her a blanket. &ldquo;Butterworth is very cold in winter, so this blanket is going to help me a lot. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d also like to thank the association on behalf of other poor people in the area.&rdquo;Bathabile said last weekend they helped a kasi family bury their loved one.&ldquo;We helped the Dludla family, who lost one of the sons,&rdquo; said Bathabile.&ldquo;Their son&rsquo;s body was kept in the mortuary for weeks because they didn&rsquo;t have the money to bury him. &ldquo;We intervened and gave the family money to pay for the funeral. &ldquo;We will continue to help poor families in the area. &ldquo;This is also our way of giving back to people who support our businesses.&rdquo;
