PERCY told Daily Sun he is tired of the tokoloshe that demands money every time it bonks him.&ldquo;This is a magosha tokoloshe,&rdquo; said Percy Zikhali (28) from Jabulani Hostel in Soweto.He claims the tokoloshe visits him at night and gives him great joy in bed, which he doesn&rsquo;t mind, but what he doesn&rsquo;t like is when the tokoloshe wants money.It doesn&rsquo;t want a lot, but it can be tough for the father of one to manage, especially if they have three or four rounds a night.&ldquo;It demands R10 after sex. I have to pay up because if I don&rsquo;t, we start fighting and I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll get hurt. Sometimes we have four rounds a night,&rdquo; claimed Percy. &ldquo;She is beautiful. She is a yellow bone with big boobs and a beautiful body with curves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried dating other women, but they couldn&rsquo;t give me the pleasure the tokoloshe gives me and I ended up dumping them.&rdquo; Percy told the People&rsquo;s Paper that he tried getting rid of the tokoloshe, but she wouldn&rsquo;t go and now he&rsquo;s enjoying its company.Percy&rsquo;s friend, Linda Xaba (28) confirmed Percy is not interested in women and is satisfied with the magosha tokoloshe. &ldquo;As long as he is happy, we are also happy for him,&rdquo; said Linda.Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said things may seem nice for Percy now, but the tokoloshe was sent to him by someone evil. &ldquo;He needs to be cleansed by a powerful sangoma.&rdquo;
