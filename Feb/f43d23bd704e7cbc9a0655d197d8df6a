HE PROMISES to pay good money for body parts, but he doesn&rsquo;t reveal what he will do with them once he&rsquo;s got them.The pamphlets seen on street poles and in malls offer a list of body parts the doctor will take out of your body and how much he is prepared to pay. He even applies emotional blackmail: &ldquo;If not for you, do it for your loved ones.&rdquo;The top line of the pamphlet reads: &ldquo;Dr Uba pays the best prices for all your body parts and organs.&rdquo;Human eyes are worth up to R5 000, breasts go for R1 800 and a tongue is R2 500. Testicles are priced at R1 600 each, hands and kidneys at R3 800. The pamphlet says rhino parts are also available. The &ldquo;sangoma&rdquo; who calls himself Dr Uba claims his methods are safe.&ldquo;Hurry and wash in holy spiritual water to make a full recovery,&rdquo; promises the yellow pamphlet.People have been disgusted by the pamphlets. Noma Ntshali (52) from Alexandra, Joburg said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe someone can advertise such things to the public. What does it say about our law enforcement?Marks Thela from Joburg CBD said: &ldquo;This advertisement is a fake. People must be careful of this.&rdquo; Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the pamphlet was playing with people&rsquo;s minds. &ldquo;We are warning people not to fall for such things,&rdquo; he said.Makhubele said police would launch an investigation.For two days, Daily Sun tried to call &ldquo;Dr Uba&rdquo; on the cellphone number provided, but the man who promises he will never change his name or hide his face from the public never answered his phone.
