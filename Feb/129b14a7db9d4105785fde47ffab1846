&ldquo;WE REFUSE to live with pigs!&rdquo; These were the words of residents of extension 8 in Alexandra, Joburg who say they are gatvol of a neighbour who breeds pigs. Resident Steven Diphoko (66) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are not animals and we refuse to live like pigs. This man arrived here in September and started breeding his pigs in an open space in front of our houses. &ldquo;When we approached him as the community and asked if he had permission to breed animals, he told us we didn&rsquo;t own the open space and we couldn&rsquo;t tell him what to do. &ldquo;Now we are forced to live with these pigs. The smell in this place is extremely bad. &ldquo;Some of my relatives refuse to visit me because of this pigsty.&rdquo; Another resident, Kutlwano Mokwena (49), said the pigs were a danger to the health of the children in the area. &ldquo;You know how kids can be naughty. They go there to play in the dirt and come back with infections. This place is unhygienic and we demand that this man leave.&rdquo; The SunTeam approached the owner of the pigs, Jacob Mokgalema, who said residents were jealous of him. &ldquo;They should mind their own business. I don&rsquo;t need permits or documents for my pigs. This is God&rsquo;s land and I can breed my animals anywhere I want.&rdquo; Mike Allan of the SPCA said although it wasn&rsquo;t illegal to breed domestic animals, there were procedures that needed to be followed. &ldquo;Owners need to ensure breeding is done within the law. We will send representatives to evaluate the pigs and their living conditions before we decide what to do.&rdquo;
