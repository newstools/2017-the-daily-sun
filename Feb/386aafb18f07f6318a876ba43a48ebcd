JOGGING 10km every afternoon keeps Buhle Mdlalose healthy and fit. But it&rsquo;s sometimes dangerous as his kasi&rsquo;s streets are full of tsotsis.The man (27) from KwaMashu&rsquo;s B section, north of Durban has decided to jog with his two dogs &ndash; Trouble (2) and Danger (3).&ldquo;This is because I have seen many joggers being mugged by tsotsis in the area,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun. Buhle and his dogs jog together every afternoon from 5pm to 6pm, after work. He is a plumber at eThekwini water department.&ldquo;I started to jog last year and in that period I saw a few joggers being robbed of their cellphones and pedometers. &ldquo;Last month I decided to bring my dogs to protect me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to jog with other people because sometimes they are lazy about running. &ldquo;The dogs were bought by my dad in 2015.&rdquo;He said that even though he hasn&rsquo;t been robbed, he won&rsquo;t stop jogging with his dogs.&ldquo;No one can touch me when my dogs are with me. They&rsquo;ll attack anyone who tries to rob me.&rdquo; He said he loves his dogs and they are his best friends. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;m able to share my time equally between my dogs and my girlfriend,&rdquo; he told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;She also loves my dogs and doesn&rsquo;t mind when I&rsquo;m jogging with them.&rdquo;
