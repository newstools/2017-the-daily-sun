FIFA president Gianni Infantino will continue where Sepp Blatter left off when it comes to the development of African football and women&rsquo;s empowerment in the game. Blatter, who was dramatically kicked out of Fifa, was the previous president of the international football governing body and brought World Cup to the continent when South Africa hosted in 2010.Infantino, who was speaking at the Nelson Mandela Foundation ahead of the Fifa summit next week, said that although he was still learning about African football, he realised there were needs to address. Said Infantino: &ldquo;If there is one challenge where I want Fifa to succeed it is the development of football in Africa. I am not just saying this because I am in Africa. That&rsquo;s why we have an African lady (Fatma Diouf Samoura) as the secretary-general so that we can share the responsibility.&ldquo;I have seen the true passion of football, everyone is playing on the streets and on pitches that have been improvised. This is something we have started to lose in Europe. &ldquo;Imagine if we could channel this passion with some structure, infrastructure and some professionalism.&rdquo;He said that although they were still in discussion on the number of countries to be added to the new World Cup pool, having more African teams would a good start. Fifa has also increased the number of African members on the Fifa council from four to seven.He added: &ldquo;I have been travelling since I got elected, I have been to about 10 African countries. We have been learning about their needs. Women&rsquo;s football is also an area we want to develop. There is a big gap in Africa.&rdquo;PSL chairman Irvin Khoza said he was happy with Infantino appointing Samoura to his executive committee. Said Khoza: &ldquo;I am happy the president of Fifa has shown he is a transformational leader. To us, African women build families and communities.&rdquo;
