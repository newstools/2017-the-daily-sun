WHILE most of her friends are studying at tertiary institutions, Sandisile Mtshali (21) is sitting at home doing nothing.This is because she shares an ID number with someone else. Even though she passed her matric very well, Sandisile can&rsquo;t continue with her studies.&ldquo;My life is at a standstill because I don&rsquo;t have an ID,&rdquo; said Sandisile from Joburg. &ldquo;I feel like an illegal foreigner in my country.&ldquo;I wrote my matric using a letter from Home Affairs. &ldquo;I have been trying to apply for an ID, but had no luck.&rdquo;Sandisile lost her ID while she was still at school. &ldquo;When I went to apply for a new ID at Home Affairs in Alberton, officials told me that according to their system, I shared an ID number with someone from Mpumalanga.&rdquo; She said they advised her to bring a clinic card proving where she was born.&ldquo;They also told me to bring a letter from my former school, and to come with mum to prove if she was born in Mzansi. I did that but I still don&rsquo;t have an ID.&rdquo;Thabo Mokgola, spokesman for Home Affairs, said: &ldquo;We will investigate Sandisile&rsquo;s matter to see what has been causing the delay.&ldquo;I will refer her problem to the provincial manager, who will contact her and try to speed up the process.&rdquo;
