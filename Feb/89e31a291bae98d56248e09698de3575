Out-of-form Liverpool face a tough test when they welcome high-flying Tottenham Hotspur to Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday evening.The only word to describe the Reds' form coming into this fixture is abysmal. The once title hopefuls have dropped down fifth after a run of three Premier League games without a win, while also being knocked out of both the FA Cup and EFL Cup at the end of January.The last time Liverpool tasted victory, in any competition, was against League Two outfit Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup almost a full month ago.Fullback Nathaniel Clyne admitted that the side owe their fans a big performance this weekend."It wasn't good enough against Hull and there has to be a response," he told the Liverpool Echo."The fans will be up for it and we need to give them a boost. We haven't won at home for a while and we have got to put that right."Spurs, on the other hand, have experienced contrasting fortunes and find themselves second in the standings after an impressive nine-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, which included six wins in a row through December and January.Despite the fact that his side trail Chelsea by a daunting nine points, Lilywhites manager Mauricio Pochettino insists the title race is not over yet."We are in the table after Chelsea, and we are a contender but then there are a lot of teams that are contenders," he said ahead of the match."There are a lot of games ahead. It is true that Chelsea have a big gap, a massive gap - nine points is massive - but it is not decisive."Liverpool's biggest concern is at the back, where they have been leaking too many goals of late. To compound their problems, Dejan Lovren is yet to return to first-team training but could play if he passes a late fitness test.Lucas played at center back against Hull City because of an illness to Ragnar Klavan and the Reds faithful will be hoping the Estonian will be well enough to make a comeback on Saturday.Spurs have no fresh injury news but are still without key defenders Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen, while wingers Georges-Kevin N'Koudou and Erik Lamela are also injured.
