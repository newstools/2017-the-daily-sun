SOME residents living in Mgogo-gweni in Port Alfred are still using their old toilets, even though the municipality built new ones for the community last year.The residents said they were confused when their neighbours got toilets but they got nothing. They still carry buckets of water to the toilet because the ones they are using do not flush.The residents have been using these same buckets for the past five years. Resident Mncedisi Sonjica (62) said: &ldquo;I was surprised when I did not get a toilet. &ldquo;When I asked the municipality what was going on, they said I did not register for a new toilet.&rdquo;The madala carries buckets full of water to the toilet whenever he needs to relieve himself. The residents said they have lost hope of ever getting new toilets.Khululekile Mbolekwa, spokesman for the Ndlambe Municipality, said: &ldquo;Port Alfred&rsquo;s residents are very lucky, because a lot of them received toilets. &ldquo;Not every household will get a toilet, especially during the first phase of the programme.&rdquo; Mbolekwa said the first phase of the project had been completed. He said those who did not received new toilets might get them during the second phase of the project.&ldquo;These residents just need to wait. Unfortunately I do not know how long that will be.&ldquo;Some households in other neighbourhoods also did not get new toilets, so Port Alfred residents are not the only ones who must carry buckets to the toilet.&rdquo;
