PARENTS believe their children&rsquo;s schools are safe. But school turned out to be the worst place to be for Madire Mohadi. The 16-year-old was allegedly electrocuted last Tuesday at school as she was running in the rain to her classroom.According to witnesses, the grade 12 pupil at Geluksdal Secondary School near Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, touched the door frame, which allegedly shocked her.Madire was declared dead at the scene by paramedics. Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said district officials visited the school but said it was not clear what caused the shock. Pupils told Daily Sun thugs had tampered with the electric meter boxes and stolen cables from the mobile classrooms.&ldquo;Some of the meter boxes are still open. We expected the school to fix the problem but it took too long. If the problem had been fixed Madire would still be alive today,&rdquo; claimed the pupils.An inquest docket has been opened at Tsakane Police Station.
