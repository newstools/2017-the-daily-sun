OFFICIALS in Mozambique say seven people died and thousands of homes have been destroyed in a tropical cyclone that is currently working its way across the north of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Dineo made landfall in southern Mozambique late on Wednesday and has since been downgraded to a tropical storm. Emergency officials in Mozambique are reporting downed power lines and blocked roads in Inhambane, the province that suffered the worst impact.Despite Dineo having decreased in intensity, the South African Weather Service warns high speed winds in excess of 50/km and heavy rainfall can still be expected as the storm "poses great risk" well into the weekend.The South African government has called on communities to be on high alert for the knock-on effects and to take precaution,s especially ensuring children are safe and not crossing bridges or near rivers that are at risk of flash flooding.Disaster management teams in KZN, Limpopo and in the Kruger National Park remain on standby. The South African Weather Services warns that the Lowveld and escarpment in Limpopo and Mpumalanga are likely to be most affected by the ex-tropical cyclone Dineo going into the weekend. Heavy rain leading to flooding is expected in the Ehlanzeni District of Mpumalanga as well as in the Vhembe, Mopani and Capricorn Districts of Limpopo until Friday night. By Saturday, patches of heavy rain may continue over the northern parts of Namibia and Botswana respectively.&nbsp;http://traveller24.news24.com/News/Alerts/dineo-hits-sa-stormy-weekend-ahead-20170217&nbsp;
