VALENTINE&rsquo;S DAY has become so commercialised that, for partners who don&rsquo;t have money to splash on expensive gifts, the day is something not to look forward to.&nbsp;But money doesn&rsquo;t have to be one&rsquo;s measure of love in a relationship. That&rsquo;s according to relationship advisor, Phuthuma Diego.&nbsp;&ldquo;People often tend to use material things and money to measure love. This is misleading. We all know of people who are married to rich people and have everything that money can buy, yet they&rsquo;re unhappy.&nbsp;&ldquo;Couples should create their own language of love and never measure up their acts of love and love language with other partners,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Mbali Pholo (*not her real name) from Benoni, Ekurhuleni, said she preferred acts of love.&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone can buy you expensive gifts and yet you&rsquo;re not in love with them. I&rsquo;m the type of woman who wants to be shown love and affection, although I wouldn&rsquo;t mind gifts every now and then. Imagine getting both these from the person you love the most,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;The rush of getting the &ldquo;most expensive Valentine&rsquo;s Day gifts&rdquo; has started on social media platforms, with some male partners feeling the pressure.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s embarrassing for me to not be able to provide my girlfriend with a present like an expensive phone, because my financial situation allows me to get her a card and maybe chocolate.&nbsp;&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t voiced her dissatisfaction, but I make up for my lack of money by helping her with the laundry, going to the library on her behalf to get her assignment study material &ndash; and offer her body massages whenever I can,&rdquo; said Thabo Luburu (*not his real name) from Joburg.&nbsp;Phuthuma said acts of love were appreciated by most women, as they showed that their male partners were considerate and thoughtful enough to lessen their burden of household chores.&nbsp;&ldquo;To rekindle the spark and keep the love going strong doesn&rsquo;t have to involve cash. Learn to fall in love with people&rsquo;s souls instead of their pockets,&rdquo; said Sara Mudau from Emalahleni, Mpumalanga.&nbsp;She said love and being appreciated should be an everyday occurrence instead of a once-a-year occasion.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love someone who listens and gives their time. An expensive gift can&rsquo;t compete with an involved partner, who is always there for me. I value time spent doing things we love, like reading, watching movies and taking a walk in the park,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Money solves problems, but it doesn&rsquo;t replace human involvement and quality time.&rdquo;&nbsp;This Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Phuthuma suggests that loving couples should try and rewrite their ongoing romance &ndash; by giving each other unconventional gifts and spending quality time together.&nbsp;
