The family opened a case of theft against the gospel star.

He stole from us and confessed. We want him behind bars,&rdquo; said family spokesman Sipho Ngidi.&ldquo;We could have taken the law into our own hands but decided to let the police do their job. &ldquo;KwaMashu residents beat Nhlakanipho up after he confessed. &ldquo;We stopped them, thinking they would kill him. We know he is famous but we don&rsquo;t care about that.&rdquo;When contacted for comment, Nhlakanipho told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The case is under investigation. You should ask yourself why I was not arrested if indeed I did steal that money. &ldquo;Some people make up stories about others to satisfy their agendas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not willing to answer your questions because the matter is in the hands of the law.&rdquo;
