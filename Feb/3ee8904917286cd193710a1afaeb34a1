PEOPLE can sing together but pupils find it hard to concentrate when three teachers are teaching three different classes at the same time in the same room. This is the daily chaos at Faith Mlaba Primary School in Ntuzuma, north of Durban as grade two, three and four kids are all taught in one hall.Parents have lost all hope and claim to have pleaded with the education department to move their children out of the crowded school and into an old court building which is no longer in use.The parents told Daily Sun that they are not happy their children are studying in one hall while others have to learn in congested mobile classrooms. Parent Nosipho Mchunu (35) said the only thing they wanted was for their children to have decent classrooms.SGB chairwoman Faith Mjekevu said the school has had a shortage of classrooms for about 10 years.She said they were waiting for the department to tell them when kids could be moved to the old court building.&ldquo;Parents have lost faith in the department. As the SGB we don&rsquo;t know what to say to them anymore.&rdquo; KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said there were two projects for the school.&ldquo;One is to make changes in the court building, the other is to build a new structure on the court site.&rdquo; He added that one project is in the design stage while the other is waiting for money from the next financial year.
