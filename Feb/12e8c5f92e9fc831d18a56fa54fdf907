THE protests in Bela-Bela, Limpopo may have ended now that the mayor has suspended the electricity fee increase, but for a young mum, the heartache has just begun.Karabo (10), the son of Johanna Khumalo (29), died after he was struck by two rubber bullets during a protest in Bela-Bela on Tuesday night.Johanna told Daily Sun she and her son, Karabo were never part of the protest.&ldquo;I visited a friend who lives far away from where the protest was taking place,&rdquo; she said.When she got home she realised she didn&rsquo;t have her key. She and her son went back to the friend&rsquo;s house to look for the key. As she was walking home, a police Nyala raced by.&ldquo;My son, my friend, her child and I were the only ones in the street when the police started shooting at us. They shot my son in the head and my friend in the back. I heard my son calling my name. That was the last time I heard his voice.&rdquo;The boy&rsquo;s father, Reuben Malivhoho (38), said his son was with him the whole day.&ldquo;An hour after he left my house, I heard he had been shot. The cops who did this must face the music. Karabo didn&rsquo;t deserve to die like this.&rdquo;Mayor Jeremiah Ngobeni&rsquo;s car was torched on Tuesday after protests broke out over electricity rates, but on Wednesday he said the situation was under control. Moses Dlamini, spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, said police only reported the death yesterday. He said the discharge of an official firearm was not reported to them. The failure to report this will also be investigated.
