IT IS advisable to slow down when you see wild animals on the road.This is a well-known rule on Limpopo&rsquo;s roads.But when you see an angry elephant coming your way, you better stop in your tracks!That is what pedestrians and motorists did yesterday morning when an irritated elephant bull stopped traffic on the road between Hoedspruit and Phalaborwa.The incident happened at about 7am on Sunday.Motorists&rsquo; trips were soon put on hold as the elephant claimed the road for itself and started charging at approaching cars.Some locals joked that it might have been looking for a zebra crossing!The elephant invasion lasted for more than an hour as motorists and pedestrians waited for the animal to calm down.After the elephant settled down, everything went back to normal and road users could pass peacefully.The national Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said the elephant broke through the fence of a local game reserve.Inspector Arno de Klerk of the SPCA&rsquo;s wildlife protection unit said the animal could have been provoked.&ldquo;Elephants, like other wild animals, can be provoked by little things such as having a stone thrown at them. This could cause them to respond in anger.&ldquo;Wild animal behaviour is very unpredictable and people should always give way when they encounter these beasts.&rdquo; The bull broke the fence of a local game reserve and soon confronted passing pedestrians and motorists.According to police, no casualties were reported.Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said no incidents were reported and that the elephant was lured back into the reserve by game rangers.
