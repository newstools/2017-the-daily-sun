A WOMAN S itchy nose led to a stomach-churning discovery recently . . .The Indian woman, only identified by her first name Selvi (42), felt a burning sensation in her nose one night, just after scaring away an insect which had run on her face. Well, at least she thought she had scared it away . . .The insect had in fact crawled up her nose and started digging into her brain!She asked her son-in-law to take her to hospital, where doctors discovered the roach crawling around in the skull cavity between her eyes. If it had died in there, the rotting roach would have caused inflammation in her brain, which could have killed her.Luckily doctors pulled it out, still alive and in one piece, through her nose!
