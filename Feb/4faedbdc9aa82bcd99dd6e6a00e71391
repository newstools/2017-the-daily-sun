Zimbabwe national team coach Callisto Pasuwa believes that star forward Khama Billiat has all the attributes needed to succeed in Europe and that he should seek a move there now.Billiat had a disappointing 2017 Africa Cup of Nations for the Warriors although he has been outstanding for Mamelodi Sundowns in South Africa's Premier Soccer League.The 26-year-old was also a key figure as Downs won the CAF Champions League last year.As such, Pasuwa, who was reportedly set to resign as Zimbabwe coach following the nation's exit in the group stages, told the&nbsp;Herald: "I am one person who thinks it is now time for him to move to European clubs and he has done a lot for the SA league. He has proven he can do anything in a game."Khama is one player who doesn't have one dimension of play. He can easily change, he can dribble, he can play basic football which is one area he has got an advantage if things are tough for him. He can also go into dangerous positions and passes the ball very well."
