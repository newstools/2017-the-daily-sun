GAUTENG&rsquo;S embarrassed health authorities have moved quickly to fix the broken system that led to the death of at least 94 mentally ill patients.This follows Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba&rsquo;s scathing report slamming the department &ndash; from former MEC Qedani Mahlangu to rank and file staff &ndash; for the murderous neglect.Several mentally ill patients have been transferred from an illegal NGO to a Lenasia hospital since the report&rsquo;s release, and more transfers from other illegal NGOs are underway.The report recommended that the Gauteng Mental Health Marathon Project should be de-established.It has been reversed and a team of specialists and officials are visiting NGOs that are currently caring for mental health patients who were transferred from Life Esidimeni centres. The five high risk NGOs identified by the report are being prioritised.A joint statement by the national and provincial health departments stated that they would work together to overhaul mental care in Gauten,g and that the World Health Organisation has been contacted to provide expert assistance.Meanwhile, Dr Gwen Ramokgopa was sworn in as a Gauteng MPL and appointed MEC for health yesterday.This comes as disciplinary proceedings were initiated against department officials on Friday, while a police investigation is also already under way. All cases relating to the project are to be centralised. In addition to this, the national department has started the process of reviewing the licences of all the 27 NGOs which received patients during the period of the project. Specialists advised that everything should be done to avoid any more negative impact on the patients when they are moved to suitable institutions.
