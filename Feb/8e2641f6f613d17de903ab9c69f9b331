KASIS in the Nelson Mandela Bay area are up in flames as gatvol residents protest over lack of services.The municipality and the Eastern Cape human settlements department have been blaming each other for the problem. Meanwhile, squatters in Ekuphumleni, KwaZakhele have taken their protest to the next level. On Tuesday morning they threw buckets full of kak onto motorists on Matomela and Maqanada streets. They also burned tyres and wood on the streets. Protester Nomacule Ntlanganiso (48) said: &ldquo;We are angry because we have been promised RDP houses, but they never come. In the 2015 financial year R13,5 million was budgeted to build 194 houses in our area but the project was delayed. &ldquo;We want our houses now and we have been calling on mayor Athol Trollip to come and address us, but there has been no sign of him. This is why we made the decision to dump kak on the streets.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they needed to speak to the national and provincial governments. &ldquo;Some projects are under the control of the national government and others under the provincial government.&rdquo;Eastern Cape Human Settlements spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said: &ldquo;The process of selecting beneficiaries for housing subsidies starts with the municipality.Please speak to the municipality.&rdquo;
