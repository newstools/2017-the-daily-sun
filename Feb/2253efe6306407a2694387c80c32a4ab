RANGERS in the Kruger National Park witnessed how the raging Limpopo River swept away Zimbabweans trying to cross into Mzansi.The rangers were patrolling the border between the two countries last week when they saw the group attempting to make it to South Africa.Most of them probably drowned after they were swept away. Those who managed to cross were arrested and taken to a police station at the border. The victims are believed to be from villages such as Sengwe, N&rsquo;wanedzi and Chikwalakwala. A ranger told Daily Sun: &ldquo;In December we saw a group of Zimbabweans being swept away by a flash flood.&ldquo;Two weeks ago another group died in the same river.&rdquo;Provincial police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: &ldquo;We urge everybody entering and exiting the country to make use of the authorised ports of entry.&rdquo; Kruger Park spokesman William Mabasa said they discourage anyone from entering the park illegally. &ldquo;There are dangerous animals in the park that can kill people trying to cross on foot,&rdquo; he said.
