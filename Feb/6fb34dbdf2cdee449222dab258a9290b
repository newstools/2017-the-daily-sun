Dear MizzBI am a man who is sexually active.My problem is that when I use a condom with my girlfriend, I don&rsquo;t enjoy sex at all. But when I sleep with her without a condom, I perform to the best of my ability and always satisfy her.I want to protect her, but what can we use as condoms are failing us? Please help us.- Wanting PleasureDear Wanting PleasureIt&rsquo;s great to hear that you are concerned about your sexual health and that of your girlfriend. It&rsquo;s also important to hear that you and your partner use protection. But I think it&rsquo;s time for you and your girlfriend to test other types of condoms and see what suits you best.It will also help you find other kinds of protection which can be used.
