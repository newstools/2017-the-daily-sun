RESIDENTS are suffering because of a shortage of doctors at Butterworth Hospital in Eastern Cape.Patients who need treatment for diabetes and high blood pressure are the worst affected. A nurse at the hospital said: &ldquo;Residents have been coming here since last Monday to receive medical care, but there aren&rsquo;t enough doctors. &ldquo;Old people come here to have their blood pressure checked and to receive treatment for diabetes. &ldquo;All we can do is check their files.&rdquo;Sebenzile Mphongwana (54) from Tholeni Village said: &ldquo;I have been travelling to this hospital since Monday.&ldquo;I was hoping to get treatment for my diabetes. I do not know how I am going to sleep. &ldquo;It costs a lot of money to come here. &ldquo;Just imagine coming here for a week without receiving any treatment.&rdquo;Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the hospital has several doctors, four of whom were seasonal.He said the hospital also has two clinical associates. &ldquo;One Cuban doctor left and the other one had a problem with his documents. &ldquo;One of the doctors is furthering his studies, while another is moving to Frere Hospital to become a registrar.&rdquo;Kupelo said another doctor is moving to Cecilia Makiwane Hospital and the provincial health department is working hard to find replacements.
