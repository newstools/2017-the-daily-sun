This led to security closing down the campus.Willa de Ruyter, TUT spokeswoman, said students writing exams at the Tshwane show grounds on Friday were able to do so without any interruptions. &ldquo;There are continued engagements between management and the elected student leaders. We hope common agreement will be made soon. &ldquo;We have a contingency plan should anything happen,&rdquo; she added.
