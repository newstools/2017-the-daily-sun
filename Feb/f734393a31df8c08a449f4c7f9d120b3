We collapsed.&rdquo;Arsenal need to win 4-0 in order to progress in the return tie in London on &nbsp;March 7.Wenger, though, refused to use the loss of Laurent Koscielny through injury as an excuse.&ldquo;Overall I must say they [Bayern] are a better team than us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They played very well in the second half and we dropped our level. I do not look for excuses.&ldquo;If you asked if I would have loved to keep Koscielny on the pitch, I would say yes. But no matter what we say now, it will be turned in a way that&rsquo;s detrimental to us because we had a very negative result.&ldquo;It looked like we lost our organisation. Not only did we lose our centre-back, but we had a combination of mental and organisation problems.&rdquo;Wenger&rsquo;s opposite number Carlo Ancelotti, meanwhile, praised Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara after a sparkling display that included a brace."He played very well and scored two goals," Ancelotti said."It was a perfect performance."The Italian also refused to accept Bayern were already in the last eight."The result is important, but we have another game in London," Ancelotti said.
