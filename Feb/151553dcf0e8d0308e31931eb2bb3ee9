THE Brethren Mission Church supports former African Union Commission chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma bid for the presidency. On Saturday, Dlamini-Zuma visited the church in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, with ANC Women&rsquo;s League president Bathabile Dlamini. Dlamini-Zuma will be competing with deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa for the ANC&rsquo;s top position at the party&rsquo;s elective conference later this year. Ramaphosa has received the backing of Cosatu and ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu. According to a report over the weekend, the church said the country should not miss the opportunity to make Dlamini- Zuma president. The church&rsquo;s Khwezi Masondo said: &ldquo;Dlamini-Zuma is here to lead the nation.&rdquo;Dlamini-Zuma officially launched her campaign for the presidency early this month during a visit to a church in Carletonville. In a Daily Sun article published at the beginning of the month, Dlamini described Dlamini-Zuma as a fearless leader who changed many lives. She denied rumours that Dlamini-Zuma didn&rsquo;t work well with other people. Dlamini said at the time: &ldquo;I have spoken to a lot of people who have worked with her and they all tell me she&rsquo;s a hard worker.&rdquo;
