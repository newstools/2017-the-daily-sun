MOST parents encourage their children to go to school to avoid drugs and illegal substances.But parents of pupils at Sediba Sa Tsebo Primary School in Soshanguve Block DD, north of Tshwane, were shocked when they found dagga plants growing in the school garden.The dagga was planted in between vegetables being grown to feed the pupils at the school.The parents made the shocking discovery on Monday morning.Klaas Malibe (50), a parent, said he received a call from another parent who had seen the dagga.He said it seemed as if the crop has been growing for some months.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very disappointed in the school. &ldquo;How can they grow illegal plants in front our children?&rdquo; he said.Klaas said he wondered whether pupils had seen the dagga.&ldquo;Our kids should not be exposed to such things. It&rsquo;s clear the teachers know something about this.&rdquo; Klaas said he and a group of parents plan to shut down the school today until someone takes responsibility for growing the illegal plants.&ldquo;Someone needs to account for this. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let our kids go to school until we know who planted dagga in the garden.&rdquo; Sarah Masango, another parent, accused principal Tilly Nkuna of not taking care of the school.Sarah claimed the principal does not know what is going on at the school, which is why dagga could be grown right under her nose without her knowledge. Soshanguve police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleke confirmed that dagga plants were found at the school.&ldquo;The police are still busy with their investigation. &ldquo;No arrests have been made yet because we don&rsquo;t know how the dagga got there.&rdquo; Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said the principal told the department she did not know the plants were dagga or how they ended up in the school garden. &ldquo;We urge schools to be vigilant and ensure anything planted on their premises poses no threat to pupils. &ldquo;We urge members of the community to report such matters to the police.&rdquo;
