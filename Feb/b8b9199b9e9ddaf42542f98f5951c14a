HER late husband&rsquo;s sister turned to an inyanga for his ancient knowledge of muthi. But Sesi Stuurman used the latest technology to bust the culprit red-handed.And now she will get 15 cows or R30 000 after the traditional court told her sister-in-law and the inyanga to pay up! They also have to buy a goat for the ceremony to cleanse Sesi&rsquo;s home.Sesi, of Mhluzi near Middelburg in Mpumalanga, said she installed CCTV cameras after she kept stumbling on smelly muthi, sangoma cloths, stained razors and porcupine quills in her yard almost every day. &ldquo;I knew I was the target of someone&rsquo;s evil intentions.&ldquo;I had to find out who was doing this, so I installed cameras.&rdquo; On Wednesday night, at about 11.30pm, the cameras filmed the inyanga as he loomed from the shadows, tossing muthi into Sesi&rsquo;s yard. The next morning Sesi and her son viewed the footage. The footage showed the inyanga who lived nearby. &ldquo;We confronted him and he was still wearing the same clothes. He said he had been sent by my late husband&rsquo;s sister, Elsie Masemola.&rdquo;The inyanga returned to Sesi&rsquo;s house and cleaned up the muthi. He was then taken to the cop shop, as residents were baying for his blood. Sergeant Nelisiwe Masemola said the station commander called in Inkosi Mabena to intervene. A hearing was held on Saturday, where the inyanga and Elsie pleaded guilty to the charges. The inyanga was fined 10 cows, each one costing R2 000, and Elsie five. Elsie refused to speak to Daily Sun. During the hearing Elsie claimed she wasn&rsquo;t trying to kill her sister-in-law but was simply trying to soften her up so that she would return to her late husband&rsquo;s home.Traditional healer Dr Annuary Ndlovu said this type of muthi was used by jealous people to stifle a person&rsquo;s progress.
