He needs to be psychologically examined and treated,&rdquo; he said. Senzekahle, from Ladysmith in the KZN Midlands, said his ordeal started when his family received a call from a neighbour who complained about the tractor abandoned in his yard.&ldquo;We knew my father had left it there so we went to take the tractor back home.Lately he has a habit of taking family properties and abandon them everywhere. We do not know what his intention is, &rdquo;He said while trying to remove the tractor, his father appeared.&ldquo;We argued and then he pulled out a gun and shot me. Luckily the bullet missed my brain. My older brother overpowered and disarmed him. He nearly killed me,&rdquo; Senzekahle claimed.Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed that a man was still in hospital under police guard.&ldquo;The residents beat him up.
