HE TOUCHED someone&rsquo;s wife and paid a heavy price for it.&nbsp; Isaac Mutambiri from Matholesville was beaten so badly that for a while he forgot his name and didn&rsquo;t know where he was.&nbsp; He later said: &ldquo;I will never do it again, but that was the best bum I have ever seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The incident happened in the Roodepoort CBD, west of Joburg.&nbsp; Isaac confessed that he had touched the woman&rsquo;s bum.&nbsp; She was crossing the street with her husband when he put his hand on her bum.&nbsp; She screamed that someone had touched her, and her angry husband turned around and asked who had done it. Everyone pointed to Isaac.&nbsp; The husband then beat Isaac until he fainted. When he regained consciousness he couldn&rsquo;t even remember his name! By that time the couple was long gone.&nbsp; The SunTeam saw Isaac lying on the road. When he woke up he was confused and asked: &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;&nbsp; But after about 15 minutes he came to his senses. Embarrassed Isaac said he was not proud of what he did and knew he deserved the beating.
