KATLEGO Jiyane has been living in fear for three years. The 21-year-old said her neighbour, an older woman, physically and verbally attacks her, accusing her of having an affair with her husband. Katlego, from Soshanguve&rsquo;s extension 13 in Tshwane, said she told the woman her husband is too old and cold for her and she must stay away from her, but it doesn&rsquo;t help.She said it all started when the man gave her a lift to school.&ldquo;I have never had a relationship with that man but he is obsessed with me,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;He got my number somewhere and started calling me every day. He said he loved me. I told him I don&rsquo;t love him and he should stop phoning. He made a nuisance of himself on Facebook, so I blocked him.&rdquo;Katlego said because of this, people call her a home wrecker. &ldquo;They say I can&rsquo;t keep my legs closed. If he was rich and handsome, I would understand but he has nothing.&rdquo;Johannes Khoza said he had an affair with Katlego years ago. &ldquo;I was good to her. Everything was fine until she said I should leave my wife,&rdquo; he said.Johannes said Katlego threatened to ruin his marriage.&ldquo;What I had with her ended a long time ago. She does this all the time. I am sure she is targeting somebody else now.&rdquo;Johannes said his wife didn&rsquo;t want to comment. On Thursday, Katlego is taking the couple to a Ga-Rankuwa court to file a restraining order against them.
