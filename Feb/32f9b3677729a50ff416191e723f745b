THESE gatvol pupils have been begging for a proper school for a long time.In an effort to make their voices heard, they studied in the middle of the R63 road between Alice and Fort Beaufort, Eastern Cape on Wednesday.Motorists were amazed when pupils from Mdeni Senior Secondary School in Alice staged their unusual protest.A motorist posted a photograph of the protesting pupils and teachers and it quickly went viral. The motorist who posted the picture said: &ldquo;The pupils told me the painful story of how they have been begging for classrooms because they are being taught under trees. &ldquo;They have been to the education department&rsquo;s office twice in the past two weeks, but received no help.&rdquo;The SunTeam was told community members approached Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga because the provincial education department was taking too long to build them a proper school.The department gave the school funding to build prefab structures, but there was not enough money to complete the project.More money was provided by the education department and a contractor was hired to build new classrooms. But the contractor allegedly locked all the classrooms once he found out he would not get paid because the project was being investigated.Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the contractor had not been paid.&ldquo;Officials went to the school and learning has resumed.&rdquo; Police spokesman Siya Nontshinga said the protest was peaceful and no arrests were made.
