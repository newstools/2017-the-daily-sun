UNDER Pressure AmaZulu head coach, Joey Antipas, has called for his players to start getting their act together. The Zimbabwean admitted that he is having the start he was hoping for in the second round of National First Division (NFD). Having finished the first round strong by winning four consecutive matches, Antipas was certain that they would be able to pick up where they left off. But he got it all wrong and that hasn't sits well in ever demanding Usuthu fans. He has yet to win in his three matches of the second round and has managed to collect only two points. That poor start has seen Usuthu going down the NFD table to 11th position moving from fourth. "Tectically we were weak in those matches. We need to get our act together and be solid at the back. If we don't concede goals we have better chances of winning games. Also, we need to be decisive with the ball," said Antipas. On Sunday Usuthu will also be involved in yet another KwaZulu-Natal derby against Real Kings United. This grudge match will be at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu (3.30pm). Last time these two met Kings went away will all three points beating AmaZulu 2-0. But this time young Ayabulela Konqobe has promised to leave a smile on the club faithfuls. "It's pay back time and I hope they know that," said Konqobe. The 19-year-old has been sensational at AmaZulu midfield. He had a stealing game for Usuthu in their last match against Thanda Royal Zulu last week. He said:"Coach has shown his belief in me and I'm looking to repay him for that. I'm also looking to continue with my work when we face Kings on Sunday. The advantage is within us this time. We are playing at home and we have to make that count. They beat us 2-0 at their home, now it's our time."This match will also be used as the benefit game to honour AmaZulu legend Cedric "Sugar Ray" Xulu. KZN legends and Ukhozi FM team at 2pm will be used as the curtain raiser for the big match.&nbsp;
