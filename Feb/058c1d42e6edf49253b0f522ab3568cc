SPARKS flew at Missionvale Primary School in Port Elizabeth yesterday morning when parents clashed over horny teachers.Zolela Nqabeni, a teacher at the school, was kicked out of the school by parents. About 300 parents blocked the school&rsquo;s main gate, while others stood by him.Zolela told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The main problem is caused by two cheating teachers. They kiss and touch each other sexually in front of pupils. I have openly rebuked them and we had three meetings that were documented.&ldquo;I have also been challenging the handling of the school&rsquo;s funds.&rdquo;A teacher who supported Zolela said: &ldquo;We stood by him because he is fighting fraud and corruption at the school.&rdquo;SGB chairman Faans Jantjies said: &ldquo;Zolela is ill-disciplined and he interferes with the acting prin-cipal. We do not want him in our school.&rdquo;The education department&rsquo;s Walter Ah-Shene said the situation at the school was chaotic, but he would launch an investigation.
