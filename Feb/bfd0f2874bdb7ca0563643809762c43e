THEY have to use the toilets to relieve themselves but when they get there they find horror waiting for them.Several women claim to have been raped at the toilets in Matholeville, Roodepoort on the West Rand.The women say thugs wait for them behind the toilets, which are on the edge of the squatter camp. Now they say they are scared to go there alone at night.&ldquo;When you go you have to be escorted because you don&rsquo;t know what you may find. There are no lights there, so it is easy for thugs to prey on us.&rdquo;Many of the thugs cover their faces so it is difficult to identify them.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see who they are.&rdquo; Daily Sun visited the area and found the toilets behind overgrown grass, making it easy for rapists to hide.Some of the toilets have no doors&ldquo;It is scary to go to the toilet at night,&rdquo; said one woman. &ldquo;But it is also difficult to relieve yourself in a bucket at night when there are other family members in the house sleeping.&ldquo;We are forced to go to this place.&rdquo; Another woman said what makes things even worse is that their squatter camp is not electrified.&ldquo;I was raped three times,&rdquo; she claimed.&ldquo;We sometimes don&rsquo;t even bother to open cases because we know the suspects won&rsquo;t be arrested anyway.&rdquo;&ldquo;It pains me because the people who rape might live in the squatter camp. They know me but I don&rsquo;t know them.&rdquo;Captain Nonhlanhla Khumalo of the Roodepoort police advised the women to come to the station and open cases.
