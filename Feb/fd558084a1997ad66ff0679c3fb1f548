THE family took their gogo to a hospice so she could be taken care of as there was no one at home to look after her.But now they feel it was a big mistake!This is after 62-year-old gogo Eunice Makhathini&rsquo;s family from KwaMashu J section, north of Durban found her dead on Thursday. The family claimed that her body had bruises on it.The gogo&rsquo;s grandson, Thandanani Ndlovu (33) said the family does not believe she died of natural causes and wants answers from the hospice manager.&ldquo;The hospice owner called my mum on Wednesday, telling her to come because my gogo had died. &ldquo;She told my mother she was giving her two hours to come and collect the body from the hospice,&rdquo; claimed Thandanani.He said his mum couldn&rsquo;t make it to Durban in two hours as she works in Port Shepstone.&ldquo;My mum contacted my uncle to arrange with the funeral parlour so that the body could be collected. But my uncle was turned away as the owner claimed that my mum owed R5 000 for nappies that my gogo used. We were shocked as the owner kept gogo&rsquo;s pension card and we also paid R60 weekly,&rdquo; claimed Thandanani. &ldquo;On Thursday, my mother and I went to the hospice with the cops to collect gogo&rsquo;s body. The hospice owner kept the body on the veranda covered in an old sheet. &ldquo;When we opened her I noticed bruises on her body and maggots coming out of her mouth.&rdquo; When Daily Sun contacted Ekusizaneni Children&rsquo;s Home and Hospice, a woman called Sibongile Ndlela said they were aware of the matter. &ldquo;The gogo&rsquo;s family was contacted on time but they didn&rsquo;t come. They know that the patient needs to be collected by the person who brought her to the home.&rdquo; KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket has been opened at KwaMashu cop shop.&ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,&rdquo; said Gwala.
