PLATINUM Stars must have been kicking themselves after failing to utilise their chances in their 0-0 stalemate with Orlando Pirates yesterday at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.The North West side have now played three back to back draws since December last year.Dikwena created several goal scoring chances in the first half however their finishing failed them. Captain, Vuyo Mere, Ndumiso Mabena, Solomon Mathe and Bonginkosi Ntuli could have each put Stars in a good position but they made Bucs keeper, Brighton Mhlongo&rsquo;s job easy. Ntuli was lucky not to get cautioned after handling the ball in the box after his failed attempt at goal.Failing to collect points in the second half of theAbsa Premiership will further put pressure on Cavin Johnson&rsquo; men in a difficult position as they try to navigate from the relegation threatening zone.The two injury forced substitutions for Mhlongo and Issa Sarr might have worked against Pirates but the players didn&rsquo;t show any determination failing to penetrate Dikwena&rsquo;s defence. The Buccaneers bench would be hoping the pair&rsquo;s injuries will not have them sidelined for a long time.Current PSL top goal scorer, Tendai Ndoro didn&rsquo;t even make a big impact in the match, Stars players were on him, not giving him space to breathe. Although both teams came back from the halftime break with the same fighting spirit, composure in front of goal was still missing.
