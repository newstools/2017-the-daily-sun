UEFA has handed out a total of &euro; 150 million (more than R2,1 billion) to clubs who released players for the Euro 2016 qualifying matches and final tournament, European soccer&rsquo;s governing body said yesterday.Uefa said 641 clubs from 54 national associations had benefited from solidarity payments made under an agreement to appease clubs who often complain about the amount of time players spend with national teams.For the qualifying matches, an average of &euro; 3 536 (more than R51 000) was paid to a club each time one of their players was included in the 23-man squad of a national team, whether or not he played, Uefa said.For Euro 2016 itself, &euro; 7 321 (almost R106 000) per player per day was paid to so-called Category One clubs, &euro; 4 821 (more than R69 700) for Category Two clubs and &euro; 2 410 (more than R34 800) for Category Three clubs.&ldquo;I am very pleased to see that we are able to provide financial benefits to so many clubs in order to reward their contribution to Euro 2016,&rdquo; said Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin.Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of the European Club Association (ECA), said clubs invested &ldquo;substantial resources in the development of players.&ldquo;It is important and fair to recognise and reward the clubs for the release of their players,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;ECA is pleased that a serious agreement was found with Uefa, which benefits so many clubs from across Europe.&rdquo;A similar agreement exists with soccer&rsquo;s governing body Fifa for the World Cup.Clubs have often complained that their players are involved in too many international games and sometimes come back injured, although they receive compensation under a Fifa scheme when that happens.According to the Uefa figures, Juventus received the biggest handout of &euro; 3,48 million (more than R50m), followed by Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. &ndash; REUTERS
