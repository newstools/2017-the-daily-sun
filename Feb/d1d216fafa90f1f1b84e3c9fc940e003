THE South African National U-20 head coach Thabo Senong has named his 21-man squad for the 2017 CAF African Youth Championships to be held in Lusaka and Ndola, Zambia from 26 February to 12 March. With less than 10 days to go before the kick off, Senong said his Amajita side has what it takes to take Africa by storm. Amajita are in Group B, alongside Senegal, Cameroon and Sudan. They play their games in Ndola while Group A whose games will take place in Lusaka, consists of tournament hosts Zambia, Egypt, Mali and Guinea. Four top teams from the tournament will automatically qualify for the 2017 Fifa U-20 World Cup set for South Korea on 20 May to 11 June. Said Senong: &ldquo;We are going to a tough tournament, so it is imperative that we take our strongest squad. We have managed to assess the players in the matches against Zambia last week and Mali on Sunday and this is our final squad and I am happy with it. &ldquo;They (players) understand what is expected of them in the tournament and we have set objectives for this team. We are happy that the players have experience with some coming from the U-17 national set up, some from the Cosafa Cup played last year and others from the U-23 set up.&rdquo;SQUAD: GOALKEEPERS: 1.Sanele TshabalalaBidvest Wits F.C (RSA) 2.Mondli Mpoto SuperSport United F.C (RSA) 3.Khulekani Kubheka Mamelodi Sundowns F.C (RSA) DEFENDERS 4.Notha Nature NgcoboMamelodi Sundowns F.C (RSA) 5.Repo Tercious MalepeOrlando Pirates F.C (RSA) 6.Aghmat Ridhaa CeresAjax Cape Town F.C (RSA) 7.Siyabonga NgezanaKaizer Chiefs F.C (RSA) 8.Katlego MohammeSuperSport United F.C (RSA) 9.Sandile MthethwaOrlando Pirates F.C (RSA) 10.Thendo MukumelaMamelodi Sundowns F.C (RSA) MIDFIELDERS: 11.Teboho MokoenaSuperSport United F.C (RSA) 12.Sipho Percevale MbuleOrlando Pirates F.C (RSA) 13.Wiseman Meyiwa Kaizer Chiefs F.C (RSA) 14.Phakamani MahlambiBidvest Wits F.C (RSA) 15.Sibongakonke Ntuthuko MbathaBidvest Wits F.C (RSA) 16.Kobamelo KodisangPlatinum Stars F.C (RSA) 17.Grant MargemanAjax Cape Town F.C (RSA) STRIKERS: 18.Itumeleng ShopaneKaizer Chiefs F.C (RSA) 19.Khanyisa Erick MayoSuperSport United F.C (RSA) 20.Liam Jonathan JordanSporting CP (Portugal) 21.Luther SinghSporting Braga B (Portugal)
