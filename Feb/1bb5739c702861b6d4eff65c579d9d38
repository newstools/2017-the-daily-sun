FOUR months after winning their various categories at the Gauteng Sports Awards, winners are complaining they still haven&rsquo;t received their prize monies.The Gauteng Sports Department has been called out for a foul after having delayed payment of last year&rsquo;s Sports Awards winners.The glitzy awards ceremony took place at the Silverstar Casino in Mogale City, in the West Rand, on 2 October.But winners are still waiting for their pay cheques.SunSport has learnt from reliable sources that there isn&rsquo;t even any communication from the department to the winners about when they will receive their rewards.Prize money ranged from R5 000 for each finalist, and R15 000 for winners per category, while Sports Personality Award-winner would receive R45 000 and R50 000 for the Lifetime Achiever Award recipient.The source told SunSport: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been kept in the dark. They&rsquo;ve made no effort to update us on the latest developments regarding our payments.&ldquo;Since last November they&rsquo;ve been promising we would be paid at the end of the month, but nothing has come yet. The department is playing hide and seek.&rdquo;The source added that despite reaching out to the department on a number of occasions, he was still not getting a clear response regarding the cash payout.&ldquo;I contacted the department a few times and they promised they were making enquiries, but nothing has happened,&rdquo; he said.Another source said he&rsquo;s no longer thinking about the money any more.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why this process is taking so long. I expected the money to come through before Christmas since the awards were in October. I&rsquo;m hoping the department will say something and that something will be done about this,&rdquo; he added.Some finalists were not comfortable about coming out.The source went on: &ldquo;Some of us are athletes and administrators, coming out in the open will dent our future nominations.&rdquo;When SunSport contacted, Nomazwe Ntlokwana of the Gauteng Department of Sport, she said the department had to speak to Mogale City as they are responsible for making the payments. She hadn&rsquo;t responded to our e-mail enquiry at the time of going to print.
