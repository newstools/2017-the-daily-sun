GAUTENG Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa yesterday said her department will not be rushing the transfer of mentally ill patients. The patients are being moved from non-governmental organisations to public health institutions.&ldquo;We want to ensure the patients are brought closer to home so their families can visit them.&ldquo;We are also going to use monitoring and evaluating systems to ensure patients are not harmed during the transfers,&rdquo; said Ramokgopa. Former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu was not the only official who landed in hot water after more than 100 mental health patients died when they were transferred from Life Esidimeni to unlicensed NGOs.&ldquo;The head of department and the director of mental health services are on precautionary suspension. The disciplinary process with regard to other officials has begun.&ldquo;The Gauteng Mental Health Review Board is being dealt with in accordance with the Mental Health Care Act.&rdquo;She added that the department intends to call on mental health experts to guide them, moving forward. &ldquo;We can confirm that five of the NGOs have been closed. &ldquo;The remaining 22 were assessed last week and the process to transfer patients will begin next week.&rdquo;
