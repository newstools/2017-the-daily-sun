The area was cut out when the Gwayi river burst its banks as tropical storm Dineo hit the southern African country, reports say. "National, Provincial &amp; Tsholotsho [civil protection units] with NGOs are helping at least 50 families affected by flooding in Ward 6. Massive crop destruction!" Moyo tweeted.

The "sub aqua unit" is normally used to retrieve bodies though there is no confirmation yet that lives have been lost.The department said there had been "unprecedented" flooding in Insiza district, also in southern Zimbabwe.
