SOUTH Africa&rsquo;s long distance running sensation Stephen Mokoka cannot contain his excitement ahead of his first major marathon in Tokyo, Japan, this coming weekend. Mokoka will compete in the 42,2km Tokyo Marathon in Japan on Sunday. He boarded his flight to Japan&rsquo;s capital city last night to begin his quest for a first major marathon title. His training partners, Benedict Moeng and Skhumbuzo Seme, have tipped him to secure a podium finish. The two-time Olympian is hoping to run under 2:08 as he gears up for his first official race of the season. Mokoka&rsquo;s personal best is 2:07:40. He has been training hard and says he is in the best possible shape to take on the formidable Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes. Mokoka, who is coached by Michael &ldquo;Sponge&rdquo; Seme, said: &ldquo;I just cannot wait. I will be happy with 2:06 or 2:07. &ldquo;My main goal is to run a good time &ndash; a podium finish will be a bonus. I just hope that my body co-operates!&rdquo; It won&rsquo;t be the first time Mokoka is running in Asia, as he competed in Seoul in South Korea in 2010. Mokoka has also dominated the Shanghai Marathon in China, having achieved three victories there. It&rsquo;s winter in Japan but the hard-working runner is going into the marathon with a solid plan: &ldquo;I have to be smart about it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for me to find my pace and to not make a suicidal move.&rdquo; Skhumbuzo, Seme&rsquo;s son, and Moeng believe Mokoka will make them proud.
