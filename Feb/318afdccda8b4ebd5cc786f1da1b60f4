READING must be part of our everyday life. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi was speaking at the Read to Lead campaign at an event held at Halfway House in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni on Monday.The campaign, initially put in place by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, focuses on encouraging a culture of learning and reading. Lesufi said: &ldquo;Make reading a habit. Read something in the evening before you go to sleep.&rdquo;Motshekga said listening to the radio all the time was not a good thing.&ldquo;Every time you turn on the radio you hear dance music. &ldquo;You must rather start developing a love of reading.&ldquo;Make use of your libraries. &ldquo;Start reading clubs and exchange books as gifts,&rdquo; she said. She said she was worried about bullying at schools. &ldquo;The department has decided to take steps to deal with this behaviour.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll introduce an anti-bullying programme at schools to tackle the problem.&ldquo;Bullies are evil people. Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of bullying others and thinking you are smart. &ldquo;You are preparing yourself for a life in and out of jail if you follow this route.&rdquo;
