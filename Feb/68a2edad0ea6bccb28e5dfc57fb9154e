LUKHOLO Badi (36) is the new president of Eastern Cape Cycling.He is also the founder and chairman of the Imveli Cycling Academy in Port Elizabeth.He told Daily Sun that traffic will be much lighter on our roads if more pupils and adults use bicycles.Lukholo, who is a civil engineer with more than 12 years of experience, said he will push for the teaching of cycling at schools.&ldquo;I want to talk to officials in the education department and convince them to include cycling as part of the school curriculum. &ldquo;Cycling is an endurance sport that teaches pupils about physical and mental fitness.&ldquo;It also teaches them to be healthy.&ldquo;Bicycles are expensive, so I&rsquo;ll encourage pupils to be responsible and careful &ndash; they must not lose their bikes to thieves.&rdquo;Lukholo said: &ldquo;It is an exciting opportunity I have to lead a great and experienced team to develop, empower and invest in our province.&ldquo;It is my vision to uplift previously disadvantaged people &ndash; that means black, coloured and a section of the white community.&ldquo;I would like to fast-track development and focus on primary and secondary schools. &ldquo;I will focus more on rural schools. I want to promote the use of mountain bikes in farming communities because of the terrain.&rdquo;Lukholo wants the Eastern Cape to be recognised as a cycling powerhouse.&ldquo;But all eight districts should be active and represented in our provincial teams.&rdquo; He urges municipalities to make roads safer for cyclists.&ldquo;Roads must be repaired so that their surfaces are smooth. There must also be clear signposts and cycle lanes to prevent accidents.&rdquo;
