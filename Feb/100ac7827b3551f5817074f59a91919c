BEING a slaap tiger in bed might cost you your marriage.That is according to sexologist Dr Prithy Ramlachan, who hosted a sexual education workshop on Sunday. More than 50 couples attended the workshop at Garden Court King&rsquo;s Beach Hotel in Port Elizabeth.Ramlachan, president of the African Society for Sexual Medicines, said: &ldquo;The society&rsquo;s mission is to empower healthcare professionals in Africa with knowledge about sexual and reproductive health issues.&ldquo;We also want patients to realise that talking about sexual health issues is not a sin. &ldquo;Your doctor should be able to talk about these things so you can perform better between the sheets. A third of divorce cases are caused by sexual difficulties. &ldquo;We can reduce this by empowering people with information that will help couples enjoy a fulfilling sex life. &ldquo;After all, sex is the foundation of a good marriage.&rdquo;
