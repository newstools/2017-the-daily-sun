SAFA will appoint a search committee on Tuesday that will head hunt the new Bafana Bafana coach.This was revealed by Safa president Danny Jordaan following a National Executive Committee meeting in Jorburg yesterday.Jordaan told the media that the association has received 32 CV&rsquo;s from coaches in the continent and Europe who are interested to replace coach Shakes Mashaba. Former Manchester City coach Roberto Mancini, Samson Siasia formerly with Nigeria national side, former Egypt national coach Hassan Shehata, Italian Giovanni Trapattoni and Portuguese Manuel Jos&eacute; Silva are among the experienced coaches who applied for the job. Jordaan insisted that they are looking for a coach with African and international experience of between 5 and 10 years who has vision and passion for development.Explained Jordaan: &ldquo;The post will be fielded by head hunting and not advertising. The NEC asked for a meeting on Tuesday to announce the names of the search committee responsible for the appointment. They will then make recommendations through the technical committee and NEC. Lucas Radebe, Bhuda Mathathe and Farouk Khan are all there, many other coaches and former players will also be included. But they must declare first not to be interested on the position.Jordaan made it clear that the right man will need to get results immediately.&ldquo;We hope to appoint the coach by the end of February because in March we have an important fixture against Cape Verde and we have to beat them home and away. The first big match is in June against Nigeria (2019 Afcon qualifier) and the coach must hit the ground running.
