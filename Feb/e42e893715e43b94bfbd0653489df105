SOCIAL platforms have been buzzing with criticism of Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane. The Gauteng MEC for Community Safety angered many when she went to Leeuwkop Prison in Joburg and handed out chicken meal boxes to inmates on Wednesday. The MEC treated the prisoners during a special soccer match organised for them by Moroka Swallows and Sundowns. While some angry social media users complained that the MEC was giving criminals five-star treatment, others said their tax money was going to waste. After photos of the MEC handing out food went viral on Facebook, these were some of the comments: - Siyabonga Zulu said: &ldquo;Human beings that abused, killed, tortured and raped others? Wait until they do it to you or a family member and you&rsquo;ll understand why they shouldn&rsquo;t get a sponsor.&rdquo; - Sierramike Stone wrote: &ldquo;This is heartless and Satanic. If they torture and kill why do they deserve fast food bought with our tax money?&rdquo; - Blackie Dee: &ldquo;To be honest, a criminal is a criminal. &ldquo;We have thousands of street kids starving while you give someone who has raped a mother or sister food?&rdquo; However, some people praised the MEC, saying what she did wasn&rsquo;t so bad. - Ntate Mokwena said: &ldquo;Only God can judge.&rdquo; - Zizikazi Ntonela wrote: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with buying them food for a day. Maybe the fast food company donated it. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t those of you complaining about hungry families buy them food?&rdquo; Acting spokesman for the MEC, Ndivhuho Gadisi said: &ldquo;The event was part of a social cohesion and rehabilitation programme which uses sport to unite law enforcement agencies, the community and inmates. &ldquo;The MEC used this opportunity as a platform to reintegrate inmates who are about to exit these facilities. During these events various speakers give motivational talks on safety issues.&rdquo;
