They said I was disrespectful and had no right to make such demands.&rdquo;Lenah said she and her parents went back again later to speak to the in-laws.Lenah said her parents, Maria Maphila (66) and Robert Modiba (66), told the in-laws they wanted Violet&rsquo;s husband to pay lobola as the ancestors didn&rsquo;t recognise them. They said Violet and her husband had married without their consent. But the sister-in-law refused to let them see Violet&rsquo;s corpse. She allegedly demanded that they slaughter a goat to first cleanse the bad luck in their home.Lenah said her mum fainted when she went back to the sister-in-law&rsquo;s house and was told that Violet had been buried on Saturday. &ldquo;When Violet was ill she asked us to bury her. Her father was aware that she married my brother and was a witness to their marriage.&rdquo;
