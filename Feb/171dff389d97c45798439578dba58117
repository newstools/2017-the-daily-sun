Arsenal will be hoping to get back to winning ways when they host a reinvigorated Hull City side at the Emirates in the Premier League on Saturday.After a run of four consecutive wins in all competitions, Arsenal have now lost two on the trot, suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at home against Watford before a 3-1 defeat at league leaders Chelsea. The north London side are fourth in the standings, only one point clear of Liverpool.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the press before the game: "The way we respond to our disappointing result last Saturday is vital."Since the arrival of manager Marco Silva, Hull have looked a different side and should be full of confidence after beating the Reds 2-0 last weekend, following a goalless draw with Manchester United."I want more from my team after our last two results; we have the quality to give more and play better," Silva told the press.Arsenal will be boosted by the return of midfielder Mohamed Elneny from Africa Cup of Nations duty, but full-back Hector Bellerin is a doubt due to the concussion he suffered against Chelsea. Granit Xhaka is unavailable due to a suspension.Hull City are still unable to call upon defenders Michael Dawson and Curtis Davies due to injuries, while midfielder Markus Henriksen and striker Abel Hernandez are also out injured.
