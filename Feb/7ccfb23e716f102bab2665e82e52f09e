THESE parents know crowded classrooms will have a negative impact on their kids education .So on Friday they marched to the school gates and demanded more mobile classrooms.The angry parents protested outside Peongwe Primary School in Takaneng Village, near Taung, North West.Community member Tshimologo Matshidiso said grade R pupils had to share a class with grade 2 pupils, while grade 4 pupils shared their classroom with grade 7 pupils. Grade 5 pupils are forced to share with grade 6 pupils. The overcrowding affects their concentration. Some pupils have been forced to learn in a makeshift shelter outdoors, she said.She said their problems started back in 2003 when a part of the building collapsed. The department of education promised to bring more mobile classrooms. But they only delivered one, promising instead to spend R3 million towards upgrading the school. School governing body chairman Benny Blou said: The contractor arrived in 2015 to renovate the school, but left before even beginning the job. Chief Kgosiemang Motshabi of Takaneng Tribal Authority said: Whenever it rains, those who are taught outside have nowhere to go. We urge the department to address our challenges. North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said the department will deliver mobile classrooms to the school and investigate the allegations made against the contractor hired to fix the school.
