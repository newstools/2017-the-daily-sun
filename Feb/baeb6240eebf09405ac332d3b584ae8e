GOLDEN Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen is excited to have the services of experienced Nkosinathi Mthiyane, even though it&rsquo;s only for the short term. Full-back Mthiyane has been loaned to Arrows by Orlando Pirates until the end of the season. The 28-year-old joined Pirates from Chippa United at the beginning of the season but injury kept him on the sidelines.His move to Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende came as a shock to many. Only a few weeks ago he was said to be on his way back to the Chilli Boys after Bucs concluded a deal that saw James Okwuoso and Marc van Heerden head to the Soweto giants.Larsen said he had been looking for a left-back since they let Clifford Miheso go, who played as a cover for injury-prone Lehlohonolo Nonyane. &ldquo;That position has been a problem for us,&rdquo; Larsen said regarding Mthiyane, who can also fill in as winger. &ldquo;Having a player of Mthiyane&rsquo;s calibre is exciting.&rdquo;Mthiyane, who has played for Thanda Royal Zulu and AmaZulu, was expected to start training with his new team yesterday.
