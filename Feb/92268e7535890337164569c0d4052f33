SuperSport United and Orlando Pirates have agreed terms for a loan move of Togolese midfielder Dove Wome with immediate effect.&nbsp;Wome joined United from Mamelodi Sundowns in 2014/15 season and played a crucial role in helping Matsatsantsa to lift the Telkom Knock-out trophy and grabbed the player of the tournament award at the glamourous Premier Soccer League awards.&nbsp;In the same season the 25-year-old was joint top goal scorer with New Zealand forward Jeremy Brockie (10 goals) at the end of the 2014/15 season for the club. A season later helped United to lift the Nedbank Cup with a thrilling 3-2 win over the Soweto giants Orlando Pirates.&nbsp;The Fiokpo born midfielder played over 50 games for Matsatsantsa in his two-and-a-half-year spell at the club.&nbsp;Matthews explained the rationale behind the loan move saying, "Dove is a great player and was key in our League campaign and Telkom win 2 years ago. It hurts when you know the player is high quality and that he will add value to one of your key rivals (Orlando Pirates) - but at the same time this is business and we cannot be having a player of Dove's value sitting on the bench.&rdquo; &nbsp;Matthews further confirmed that the player had been engaged face to face and understood that it was the right time for a move. &nbsp;"He himself is disappointed about losing his place in Togo's Afcon squad - so now is a chance for him to show us that he should have got more game time at us and we get a chance to balance our books in the short term and hopefully recoup the rest of our investment down the line.&rdquo;
