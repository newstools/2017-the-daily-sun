THE Soweto derby between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday could inspire or break either side.Chiefs need every point available to stay in the title race, while Pirates are desperate to restore their dented pride.Amakhosi have been on a roll as they went six games without defeat prior to their league clash with Ajax Cape Town in Athlone last night.Chiefs coach, Steve Komphela, is now enjoying some peaceful sleep, while Pirates chairman, Irvin Khoza, has had to bring in Swedish coach Kjell Jonevret to halt the club&rsquo;s slump, that has seen his side turn into a laughing stock.Bucs&rsquo; humiliating 6-0 league defeat to African champions Mamelodi Sundowns two weeks ago brought pain and misery to their fans, who resorted to violence at Loftus Stadium. This was the club&rsquo;s second worst league defeat this season as they were also walloped 6-1 by SuperSport United in the first round match played in Nelspruit.Yesterday&rsquo;s league clash against Polokwane City gave Jonevret a chance to tighten up his charges leaky defence and also sharpen their attack prior to his first Soweto Derby.Although Chiefs strikers Bernard Parker and Edmore Chirambadare have been firing blanks, Pirates&rsquo; vulnerable defence could inspire them to utilise their chances. This is also an opportunity for Amakhosi&rsquo;s latest recruit, Gustavo Paez, to prove his worth and win the hearts of hard-to-please fans. On the other hand, the eagerly awaited match and the arrival of Jonevret could revive the scoring touch of Pirates&rsquo; leading goal-scorer, Tendai Ndoro.The last time Ndoro found the back of net was on 3 December, when Bucs drew 2-2 with relegation haunted Highlands Park. &nbsp;
