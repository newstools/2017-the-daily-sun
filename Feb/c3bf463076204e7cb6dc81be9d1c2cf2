Dear MizzBI am a man who finds it painful to urinate but am scared to go to the clinic. I went to a traditional health shop and was given herbs and liquid to drink but this has not stopped the pain in my penis. Please help. -&nbsp; AnonymousDear AnonymousThe signs you have described could be symptoms of an STI or serious illness that can easily be treated after a medical diagnosis. The best way to find out what is wrong is to go to a clinic, private doctor or men&rsquo;s clinic that specialises in men&rsquo;s sexual health. Do not delay in getting medical help. If illnesses are identified in time, most of them can be treated and cured.
