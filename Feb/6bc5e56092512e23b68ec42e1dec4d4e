THESE residents used to have running water in their yards &ndash; but now they are forced to fetch water from the communal tap in the area.The residents of Lindelani section A, north of Durban, said their taps have been dry since December.&ldquo;Now we are forced to queue for water because there is only one communal tap in the area,&rdquo; said Thandi Dladla (48).&ldquo;Our taps have been dry for the past two months. &ldquo;We do not know where to report the matter because our councillor is nowhere to be found.&ldquo;What worries us is that nothing has been said, and there has never been an update for when this problem will end. The municipality is failing us!&rdquo;Another resident, Vusumuzi Cele (52), said he usually fetches water twice a week. &ldquo;I drive to the communal tap twice a week to fetch water,&rdquo; Vusumuzi told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;We need water to cook, wash our clothes and flush our toilet.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s even worse is that no one is telling us what is going on. &ldquo;The municipal officials should come to the area and tell us what the problem is.&rdquo; Mthunzi Gumede, spokesman for eThekwini Municipality, said they were not aware of the water shortage in Lindelani section A.&ldquo;A team has been sent to investigate the cause of the water cuts and they will resolve the matter accordingly. &ldquo;We urge the residents to report such matters by calling 080 131 3031, or by sending a WhatsApp message to 073 148 3477,&rdquo; Gumede said.
