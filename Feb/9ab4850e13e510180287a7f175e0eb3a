IN AN alleged mystical happily-ever-after tale of Ying finding Yang, sizzling radio personality, Claire Mawisa, has allegedly bagged herself &ldquo;the right one&rdquo;.&nbsp;And according to those in the know, Thokozani Ndaba&rsquo;s tender touch is rumoured behind the celeb&rsquo;s naughty-schoolgirl-like whimsy.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve always had the hots for each other. But I guess the time had not been right until now,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I guess the timing couldn&rsquo;t be better, as they make a hot couple and really complete each other.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second insider told of a couple that had jealously guarded its alleged alliance from the media in a bid to protect it.&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been dating for almost two years now, and are practically inseparable,&rdquo; the mole alleged.&nbsp;&ldquo;The two lovebirds have practically moved in together. They spend much of their time together at Thokozani&rsquo;s love nest.&rdquo;&nbsp;And in a very rare moment of slip, the SunTeam had also basked in the splendour of their &ldquo;romance&rdquo;.&nbsp;Recently, the pair was spotted in Cape Town unleashing a whale of public affection, cuddling and embracing as though their very lives depended on it!&nbsp;This was after an event at which Claire had been an MC, alongside popular Kaya FM radio DJ, Bob Mabena.&nbsp;When called for comment, Thokozani said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; then hung up.&nbsp;Claire was not available for comment.&nbsp;Thokozani had previously been linked to several celebs, including Afro-pop musician, Thandiswa Mazwai.&nbsp;Claire had been rumoured to have dated Theo Nhlengethwa of Boom Shaka fame.&nbsp;
