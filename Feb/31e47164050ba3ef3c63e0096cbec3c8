LEGENDARY musician Enos Lubisi is an angry man.&nbsp;Enos, from Protea Glen, in Soweto, is ready to fight award-winning hip hop artist AKA for royalties of the single, One Time, which was released last year.Enos claims AKA illegally sampled a song that belongs to the 80s pop group Future titled, Party Weekend in Gaborone, without asking permission.AKA (real name Kiernan Forbes) is alleged to be playing hide and seek with Enos, a member of Future.Enos claimed no one from AKA&rsquo;s record stable wanted to arrange a meeting.Enos said he was supposed to meet AKA and his record label&rsquo;s management last week.But he claims they went AWOL and didn&rsquo;t answer their phones when he wanted to confirm the meeting.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making a fool of me. I&rsquo;ve had enough of AKA and his record company. They know very well that AKA was wrong to sample my song without my approval,&rdquo; he claimed.&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been co-operative, then suddenly, no one wants to take up my matter. I&rsquo;ve no choice but to take legal action.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money, but I&rsquo;ll fight AKA to the end. I&rsquo;m looking for a lawyer who&rsquo;s willing to represent me. I can&rsquo;t have a disrespectful boy chowing my money,&rdquo; he said.He went on to say AKA recently bought Bonang Matheba a Gucci bag worth an estimated R50&thinsp;000.&ldquo;How do you flaunt pictures of you having a nice time when you know you owe money to a madala?&ldquo;That&rsquo;s disrespectful and I will show him flames. I released that song in 1984, and for him to sample it without me getting a share is unfair.&rdquo;AKA refused to comment and hung up the phone.This is not the first time AKA has been accused of stealing a song. In 2015, a Mpumalanga group called Juice accused him of stealing their track for his song Sim Dope. It was also reported that he was in a nasty war with hip hop star Anatii for stealing his beat.
