THE Department of Water and Sanitation is in debt to the tune of R4,3 billion. &ldquo;The department is bankrupt,&rdquo; said a senior National Treasury official.&ldquo;We first raised these issues with them about seven months ago.&rdquo;The senior treasury official said internal controls, project management and contract management have collapsed completely and that the department should be placed under administration.Daily Sun&rsquo;s sister paper, City Press, reported yesterday that the situation is so bad that in November last year, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan called a crisis meeting with Minister Nomvula Mokonyane to discuss the department&rsquo;s deteriorating finances.Mokonyane&rsquo;s department is facing investigations by both Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and the Special Investigating Unit, sparked by the City Press investigation.Mkhwebane will investigate the R26 billion Lesotho Highlands project. According to the paper, confidential e-mails, contracts and letters reveal:The department has unpaid invoices amounting to R1,7 billion for the current financial year. The Water Trading Entity, a department unit that deals with water sales and rights, has an overdraft of more than R2,6 billion.At least one of their contractors is suing the department for more than R400 million for unpaid invoices.The department&rsquo;s money problems have led to the stalling of critical service delivery projects such as the Giyani Emergency Project.Confidential department documents from August 2014 revealed the Giyani Project began with a R500 million budget. But contracts worth R2,2 billion were soon added to LTE Consulting&rsquo;s original emergency tender without the correct tender processes being followed.Sputnik Ratau, Mokonyane&rsquo;s spokesman, said the department is not broke and also denied that the department had an overdraft.
