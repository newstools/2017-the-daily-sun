FORMER crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli yesterday slammed the investigation against him, calling it a disgrace.Testifying in his defence, Mdluli told the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg that he was a big fish that had to be caught at all cost.&ldquo;The charges I&rsquo;m facing now are just a continuation of the murder charge I was initially charged with. The latest ones only came in 2010.&rdquo; Mdluli said anyone could see that the investigation was not done properly.He said the investigating officers came with prepared statements that witnesses just had to sign.&ldquo;The whole thing was a disgrace. Even the way they conducted the identity parade was questionable. My face had already been splashed all over the media, but they went on to conduct a photo identity parade. &ldquo;How is that possible?&rdquo; asked Mdluli.He said the charges against him were dreamed up and would never stick.Mdluli and Colonel Mthembeni Mthunzi face charges relating to the 1999 kidnapping and murder of Oupa Ramogile, who was married to Mdluli&rsquo;s former lover, Tshidi Buthelezi.It is alleged that they intimidated Ramogile&rsquo;s family, from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni, to tell them where he and Buthelezi were hiding. Mdluli admitted that he went to Orange Farm to look for Buthelezi but denied intimidating and assaulting anyone.He said the reason he went looking for her was because their six-year-old child was crying and asking for his mother.Mdluli told the court he didn&rsquo;t know that Buthelezi and Ramogile were married.Ramogile was killed in 1999 while pointing out information at the crime scene where he was shot at the previous day.The trial continues.
