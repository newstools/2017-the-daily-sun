They ransacked the principal&rsquo;s office, as well as classrooms and stole teachers&rsquo; payslips, school equipment and stationery.Last Saturday, tsotsis hacked open security doors and took a projector used in the school laboratory.Life Sciences teacher Nomahlubi Ngoma told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are under siege. This was the second incident in one week.&ldquo;Our school and teachers have been targets on many occasions.&ldquo;We are worried about what these criminals might do with our information, since they stole our payslips. They also stole books and broke our photocopier and a music set.&rdquo; Nomahlubi said the thugs were taking advantage of the school&rsquo;s lack of security. &ldquo;Windows have been broken all over. &ldquo;We called a parents&rsquo; meeting to find a solution and protection. Our pupils are also affected.&rdquo;Grade 12 pupil Ayabonga Dingani of New Brighton said they struggle to focus on their studies. &ldquo;I am afraid to come to school early because I don&rsquo;t know what is going to happen to me.&rdquo; Police spokesman Constable Mncedi Mbombo confirmed Friday&rsquo;s incident and added that no arrests were made. He appealed to residents to come forward with information and report to their nearest police station or call the toll-free police number.
