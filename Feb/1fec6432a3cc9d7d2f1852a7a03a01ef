FEBRUARY is supposed to be a month of love and romance. But for Mirriam Lerumo (61), the first day of the month brought only death. Her daughter Patricia (34), was stabbed six times, allegedly by her jealous ex-boyfriend. Mirriam said instead of watching her daughter and other loved ones enjoying Valentine's Day on the 14th, she was left to prepare for her daughter&rsquo;s funeral. Mirriam, from Snake Park in Soweto, said her daughter lived in New- lands, Joburg. Her boyfriend allegedly stabbed her six times with an Okapi knife in the neck and body after hearing that she had found another lover who made her happy. He was arrested the next day, on 2 February. Mirriam Daily Sun: &ldquo;My daughter was the breadwinner. &ldquo;They were together for eight years. She was unhappy in the relationship and it was clear that she was always stressed and the guy was abusive. She grew tired of his abuse and decided to leave him. &ldquo;She then met someone else, but the ex-boyfriend didn&rsquo;t take the news well. Patricia and I were very close and shared an inseparable bond. &ldquo;She shared everything with me and told me everything in her life.&rdquo; Sophiatown Police Station spokesman Captain Thomas de Bruyn said a case of murder has been opened and said the suspect would appear in court soon.
