SANGOMA Thembinkosi Kwayinto has been haunted by a scary dream in which other sangomas try to throw him into a river.For three weeks, the dream meant the sangoma from Vezeyaho section near Westonaria, Gauteng woke up in fear.Now he claims his ancestors have come to warn him after he found a bird tied up on a gravestone.The 32-year-old sangoma said he consulted the bones after his dreams, but it was hard to see who was behind it all.On Thursday, he burned impepho and used snuff to ask for help from his ancestors.&ldquo;On Saturday, I was walking along the road leading to the river next to the cemetery,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Just as I stepped in the graveyard, I saw a bird with its legs tied up tightly. It had been put on top of a grave with a cross.&ldquo;The bird was screeching loudly. I sang a peaceful song and tried to get it to sleep. It looked too weak to fly,&rdquo; said the sangoma.&ldquo;I then pointed at it with my knobkerrie that I got from my gobela, and hit it. &ldquo;I believe the bird was a sign of bad luck, and that other sangomas are jealous of me as I used to get clients from as far as the Eastern Cape.&ldquo;I also believe that after cleansing myself, I will get my customers back.&rdquo; Thembinkosi said he didn&rsquo;t want to point a finger at any sangoma.&ldquo;I will keep my faith strong and wait for my ancestors to tell me what to do with the bird.&ldquo;If the bird is for revenge, then let it be.&ldquo;I will never let my soul be owned by an evil curse,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.
