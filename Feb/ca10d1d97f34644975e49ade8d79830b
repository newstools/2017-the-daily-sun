Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune says he made a promise to the club that he will not represent another football team for the remainder of his career.The Amakhosi first-choice stopper is widely regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in Africa and has long been linked with moves overseas.The 29-year-old has picked up 12 major trophies during his time with the club, including three league titles, while registering an incredible 109 clean sheets in 234 games."I made a promise to the KC [Kaizer Chiefs] faithful, the chairman and everyone at the club and this is where I want to retire," he said on the club's official YouTube channel."It's been a special journey for me. If I have to combine all the years; five years with the development squad, 13 years with the first team, so you can see it's a great, great milestone."
