Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana says there are no easy games at this stage of the season as every team is desperately fighting for points.The playmaker is concerned by the busy schedule the Brazilians face as they catch up the matches they missed while playing in the CAF Champions League and Club World Cup earlier this season."Playing catch-up games is not easy, as we are scheduled to play a number of games in a short space of time, but as soldiers we will be fighting for vital points in each game play," he told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."As the league title defenders we have a responsibility to defend our title. But we are taking a game at a time without putting us under pressure."Look, at this period of the season there is no easy game at all, as every team fights to earn vital points. So, we will be going all out against every opposition we take on until the last game."We expect a tough game against Pirates. Every player needs no motivation and looks forward to take part in a game of this magnitude. Coming to Saturday's clash, we never read much in their (Pirates') current form, as we know what to expect from them. Surely, sparks will fly."
