THERE was drama at a joint press conference of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association and the MK National Council. The briefing, held at ANC headquarters, Luthuli House in Joburg, was called by the two factions to show unity yesterday.A few minutes after former general Siphiwe Nyanda started reading a press release, an angry former MK soldier stood up and shouted at Nyanda: &ldquo;What happened to Nokuthula Simelane?&ldquo;When you were commanding us you never called press conferences! You were there when Simelane died! You were my commander.&rdquo;The man was removed by guards. Simelane was a 23-year-old activist who went missing while on a mission to the Carlton Centre in Joburg in 1983. Her family has not yet found closure.Nyanda said he knew the former soldier who shouted at him.&ldquo;I have seen him at funerals and other places. I did not even know that Simelane was a member of MK. I have heard about this comrade&rsquo;s unhappiness.&rdquo; When it seemed like calm had returned and Nyanda was midway through his speech, another man walked in and said: &ldquo;You did nothing, while the Veterans Assocation gave us houses and other things.&rdquo;The faction led by Kebby Maphatsoe, national chairman of the assocation, sat on one side and the MK National Council, led by Nyanda, sat on the other side of the table.Maphatsoe said the two factions had found each other.
