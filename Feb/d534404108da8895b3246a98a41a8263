ORLANDO Pirates assistant coach Benson Mhlongo has come out to apologise to Bucs fans following their humiliating 6-0 defeat against Mamelodi Sundowns in an Absa Premiership match played at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. Chaos erupted at Loftus Versfeld stadium when fuming Bucs fans invaded the pitch after their side conceded the sixth goal with eight minutes before stoppage time. The players and the technical team had to run for their lives as fans threw objects and chased their players. Cops were forced to get into the pitch to restore order and stun grenades were fired to disperse fans that invaded the pitch. Bucs interim coach Augusto Palacios, who also suffered during the tiff between the Sundowns and Pirates fans, was unable to come back into the field to finish the game. Mhlongo said Palacios couldn&rsquo;t return back to the pitch because he was not feeling well. Pirates have last won a league match in November when they narrowly edged out Chippa United 1-0 at Neslon Mandela Stadium. In their previous six matches in the league, Pirates have only managed to grab two points from possible 18 points. They will hope things turn around when they host Bidvest Wits on Wednesday at Orlando Stadium. Mhlongo said: &ldquo;We cannot put blame on anyone; our opponents were too good for us. The only way to apologise to our fans is to bounce back and win our next game.&rdquo; &ldquo;If your house is burnt you need to go back and rebuild it. We do apologise to our fans. The club is expected to hold a media briefing tomorrow at Rand Stadium. &nbsp;
