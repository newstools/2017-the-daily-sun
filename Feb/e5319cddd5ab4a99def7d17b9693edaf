A MAN known to a Sharpeville family in the Vaal, south of Joburg, has been accused of raping an 8-year-old girl. According to a witness, the man was sitting at a tavern next door to the family&rsquo;s home when a woman accused him of being a rapist. A friend of the 8-year-old girl allegedly overheard the accusation by the woman and went and told her friends. Moments later the 8-year-old revealed to her family that the man had raped her on several occasions. The man denied the allegations. The girl&rsquo;s mother told Daily Sun: &ldquo;When I asked my daughter about it she said the man had raped her several times. Her sister immediately confronted the man about the allegations and he did not deny it.&ldquo;She came back furious and opened the kitchen drawer, looking for a knife. I had to cool her down.&rdquo; She said they later heard a noise from outside and when they went to investigate they found the suspect in the hands of an angry mob. The SunTeam was shown four more victims allegedly raped by the suspect. Another victim&rsquo;s mum said: &ldquo;Our daughters, young and old, are traumatised by this rapist. Let the law take its course. They must arrest him!&rdquo;Captain Attie Loate confirmed that a case of rape has been opened at Sharpeville Police Station.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know when the suspect will appear in court as he is receiving medical attention.&rdquo;
