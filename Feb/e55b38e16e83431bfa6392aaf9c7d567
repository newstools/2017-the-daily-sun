FORMER Bafana Bafana striker, Siyabonga &ldquo;Bhele&rdquo; Nomvethe, believes he still has a lot to offer AmaZulu.&nbsp;The 39-year-old is enjoying his time in the National First Division (NFD) team and is not thinking of retirement as yet.&nbsp;After 18 league games played so far in the NFD, Bhele is among top goal-scorers, having found the back of the net 11 times.&nbsp;The speedy player is six goals adrift of Royal Eagles hitman, Sedwyn George, who leads the goal-scoring charts with 17 goals.&nbsp; George is followed by Mhlengi Cele of Thanda Royal Zulu with 14.&nbsp;With 12 games remaining in the NFD, Nomvethe wants to contribute to making sure AmaZulu finish in a respectable position at the end of the season.&nbsp; Said Nomvethe: &ldquo;Anything is possible, but I&rsquo;m not in the race for being a top goal-scorer. What I want is to help the team, going forward.&rdquo;&nbsp;Usuthu have been struggling to get points in their past three games as they only gathered two points.&nbsp;In the only NFD fixture today, they will lock horns with Real Kings in a KwaZulu-Natal Derby at Princess Magogo Stadium (3.30pm).&nbsp; Bhele is optimistic they will turn around their fortunes when they host Kings.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited with my performance so far and scoring goals is important to me as a striker. It makes me happy to contribute to the team&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pressure will always be there and it&rsquo;s a normal thing for me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
