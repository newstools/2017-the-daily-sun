A last-minute equaliser saw Orlando Pirates salvage a 2-2 draw with Cape Town City in a riveting encounter at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday night.The first half was evenly balanced and provided few chances except for the goal and a shot for the hosts against the woodwork.City dominated most of the second period and looked set to claim maximum points after scoring twice, until a late intervention for the Buccaneers from a Cape Town-born player.After a fast-paced start to the game saw both teams showing good attacking intent, it was Pirates who went ahead on 20 minutes after Luvoyo Memela beat Robyn Johannes and pulled the ball back for Dove Wome to squeeze the ball over the line from 10 yards out.City pushed and probed to create chances, but the Bucs defence was well-organised and left their opponents frustrated.Eric Tinkler's side were within a whisker of scoring in the 40th minute, however, when Lehlohonolo Majoro reacted sharply to control a miss-hit shot into the box, only to fire his effort onto the upright.City found more potency to their play in the second stanza, and after Sibusiso Masina had been denied, they leveled matters through Roland Putsche's 61st minute strike, the midfielder reacting smartly to volley home a loose ball in the box.Opportunities followed for the home team to go ahead, but Aubrey Ngoma and Putsche had shots blocked, while the latter's dipping drive forced Brighton Mhlongo to back-pedal and tip the ball over the bar.City went ahead five minutes from time, Lebogang Manyama brilliantly firing into the roof of the net after a superb bit of interplay, but it was not to be the winner as Riyaad Norodien rescued a point for the Sea Robbers deep in stoppage time, the former Ajax winger picking out the bottom corner from 20 yards out.
