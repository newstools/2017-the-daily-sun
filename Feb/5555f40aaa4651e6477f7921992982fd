Mamelodi Sundowns forward Khama Billiat has highlighted the magnitude of the CAF Super Cup tie against TP Mazembe, saying that there is no bigger tie at continental level.The CAF Champions League winners will do duty against the Confederation Cup winners at the Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium on Saturday evening and Billiat has revealed his excitement ahead of the mammoth clash."This is going to be a big game. Nothing can be bigger, at least at continental level," he told the club's official website."Games like this are the only way you can measure how big or good you are."Once we had won the CAF Champions League, we knew we had to do planning for the Super Cup. We know what is coming. They know us and we know them.The Zimbabwe international dismissed any talks of feeling under pressure coming up against the Congolese giants saying that it's part and parcel of the game."We are always under pressure. We need to deliver for ourselves, for the fans, for the President, and for our families."Pressure is part of our life. Games like this build character, and ideally every game we play should be at this level and intensity."TP Mazembe are a huge team, and we will respect them. But we have to do what we do best. They have achieved a lot, but that does not mean they will be better than us."We know they are not an easy team to beat, but it will all come down to who is hungrier, and I know that we are hungry enough," he concluded.
