THE residents of Block TT in Soshanguve, Tshwane are confused about who their councillor is.They say a new ward councillor was appointed in August, but the previous one, Lucas Ngobeni, is refusing to step down.They accuse Ngobeni of sabotaging service delivery in their area.The angry residents took to the streets on Tuesday, barricaded roads with burning tyres and prevented motorists from coming into their section. They said Ngobeni has been trying to sabotage the community ever since the new councillor was appointed.Resident Allen Makwati (37) said they have not had proper services in the area since August.They had tried to speak to Ngobeni, but when they talk to him, &ldquo;he runs to the police station&rdquo; and says residents pointed a gun at him.&ldquo;None of the community members has ever threatened him. He does not want to hear our concerns,&rdquo; Allen said.&ldquo;We want the mayor of Tshwane to come and address this matter and tell us who our councillor is.&rdquo;The new councillor, Maria Skhosana, said Ngobeni was not happy when she was appointed to the position.&ldquo;I work with difficulty.&rdquo;&ldquo;I sometimes feel as if I am failing the community.&rdquo;
