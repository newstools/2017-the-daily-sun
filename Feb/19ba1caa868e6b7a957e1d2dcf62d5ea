Bayern Munich defender Mats Hummels says he is relishing the last-16 Champions League tie against an unpredictable Arsenal outfit.The two side's meet for the fourth time in five years in the Champions League and Hummels is wary of the threat that Arsene Wenger's men pose, despite the London based-outfit losing their last two consecutive Premier League games against Watford and Chelsea."It's a difficult but very attractive tie," Hummels told&nbsp;Goal."It's nice, because it's in stark contrast to all our other matches. Arsenal are a team that wants to play football, they like to be in possession."Since Arsene Wenger's been there, so about 20 years, that's what they've stood for. It will certainly be a completely different game what we face in our Bundesliga matches."So you have to classify this game in complete isolation to any others and not consider what's happened before, or what can happen after."The Germany international further suggested that league form counts little or nothing when the two teams face-off on Wednesday in the first-leg of their tie at the Allianz Arena."For me it's always difficult as you have ups and downs during a season," the defender added."They had a period where they looked the strongest Arsenal team for a long time. I think they won seven or eight league games. But that's the same as us. We have good periods and bad periods."You can't predict what sort of form Arsenal or Bayern will be in."
