PARENTS from Joe Slovo near Du Noon, Cape Town, have vowed to keep teaching their kids at the school they forced open at the beginning of the school term.But the Western Cape Department of Education has warned that whatever education was taking place at the site would not be formally recognised.The parents opened the school of prefab containers that was previously called Sinenjongo High School after hundreds of pupils in the area couldn&rsquo;t be enrolled at nearby schools. The school accommodates grade R to grade 8.Pupils have no desks or any study material and use chairs and books donated by other schools. They write in their books on chairs while kneeling on the floor.Community leader Noxolo Mayeki said: &ldquo;We have over 400 pupils and parents are still coming to register. Some pupils have been on waiting lists for over three years. Primary schools in the area are full . . . what are we supposed to do? Leave our kids at home?&rdquo;Parent Phathiswa Dlokweni said: &ldquo;We have spoken to the department about this and told them a new primary school was needed. They didn&rsquo;t do anything about it. The school hasn&rsquo;t been approved, but our kids must learn.&rdquo;Education department spokeswoman Jessica Shelver said: &ldquo;The department doesn&rsquo;t own the land. The site is not a school and any education that takes place at the site will not formally be recognised. &ldquo;Parents must work with the district officials to ensure that their children are enrolled at nearby schools.&rdquo;
