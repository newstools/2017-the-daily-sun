Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has admitted that Ajax Cape Town present a danger to his side as the Urban Warriors want to improve their lowly Premiership league position.The Glamour Boys go into Saturday evening's league contest on the back of five wins in a row in the league and will hope to continue their winning streak as they look to maintain a title challenge.Meanwhile, the Urban Warriors are yet to win in 2017 and will no doubt see the clash against Amakhosi as a valuable opportunity to have the chance to get back to winning ways in no uncertain terms.As such, Komphela says that Chiefs must be aware of the threat Ajax offer. He told the club's official website: "We are always geared up for the next game, and Ajax is next. The mood remains professional and upbeat ahead of this fixture. The team is conscious of the challenges and the massive responsibility that comes with wearing this badge."I have noted the comments from the Ajax camp. They are uncomfortable with their league position. That can pose a danger or be an opportunity to make full use of their situation. We will give them the respect they deserve, but that will not change our objective of winning this game."
