FINANCE Minister Pravin Gordhan had a tough message for South Africans in today&rsquo;s Budget Speech in Parliament, with the introduction of a new tax bracket for the very rich, state debt creeping up and almost all economic indicators and financial numbers weaker than in last year's budget.While South Africa is "once again at a crossroads" and "tough choices have to be made to achieve development outcomes", Gordhan nevertheless tried to stress the need for growth.He used the word &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; more than 50 times in his speech, but against this background said: &ldquo;Our growth challenge is intertwined with our transformation imperative. We need to transform in order to grow, we need to grow in order to transform. Without transformation, growth will reinforce inequality; without growth, transformation will be distorted by patronage."Some highlights of the budget are:Over the next three years, government will spend:- R490 billion (R457 billion last year) on social grants.&nbsp; - R106 billion (R93.1 billion) on transfers to universities, while the National Student Financial Aid Scheme will spend R54,3 billion (R41,2 billion).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - R751,9 billion (R707,4 billion) on basic education, including R48,3 billion for subsidies to schools, R42,9 billion for infrastructure, and R12,7 billion (R14,9 billion) for learner and teacher support materials.&nbsp; - R114 billion (R108,3 billion) for subsidised public housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - R94,4 billion (R102 billion) on water resources and bulk infrastructure.- R189 billion (R171,3 billion) on transfers of the local government equitable share to provide basic services to poor households.- R142,6 billion to support affordable public transport.&nbsp;&nbsp; - R606 billion on health, with R59,5 billion on the HIV/Aids conditional grant.Social grant spending and increases Social grants were increased by about 7% on average.The number of social grant beneficiaries is expected to reach 18,1 million by the end of 2019/20.The specific increases are:- State old age grant from R1 505 to R 1 600 per month;- State old age grant, over 75s from R1 525 to R1 620;- War veterans grant from R1 525 to R 1 620; - &nbsp;Disability grant from R1 505 to R 1 600;- Foster care grant from R890 to R920;- Care dependency grant from R1 505 tot R1 600; and- Child support grant from R355 to R380.Tax - A new top marginal income tax bracket for individuals combined with partial relief for bracket creep will raise an additional R16.5bn.&nbsp; - R6.8bn will be collected through a higher dividend withholding tax rate.
