The promises about higher education President Jacob Zuma made in his State of the Nation Address are little more than hogwash, Wits University&rsquo;s SRC said yesterday.&ldquo;There was nothing new in yesterday's speech, just a normal pep talk,&rdquo; secretary general David Manabile said. Students had wanted Zuma to say something about the roll-out of free, quality education. Zuma said government would pay poor students&rsquo; fee increases for the 2017 academic year. &ldquo;That thing is complete hogwash. Eight percent of R120 000 or whatever amount you'll be paying is nothing,&rdquo; Manabile said. They intended writing a response to Zuma by Monday.Political analyst, Dr Somadoda Fikeni, said Zuma had not presented a clear funding plan for higher education.&ldquo;He simply stated government commitment, which has already been communicated to the public, without revealing what the new funding plan is. It was a repeat of what the government is already doing.&rdquo;Fikeni said Zuma gave a fair amount of attention to higher education, but there was nothing &ldquo;radically new&rdquo; in his speech.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zumas-sona-education-promises-hogwash-wits-src-20170211
