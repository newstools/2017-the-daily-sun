FORMER World Boxing Council international light heavyweight champion Ryno &ldquo;The Lion&rsquo; Liebenberg has vowed to leave nothing to chance in his rematch against German, Enrico Koelling, at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park on Saturday. After his controversial defeat to the highly rated Koelling in October last year, Liebenberg reckons repeated, hard punches will see him beat the German this time.The South African is looking for revenge and plans to settle the matter once and for all. The 33-year-old Liebenberg said: &ldquo;I feel great about this rematch. I have nothing but respect for Enrico for living up to his promise of giving me a rematch.&rdquo; The lanky fighter, on a quest to dethrone the World Boxing Association international light heavyweight champion, believes he won the contest fair and square, however. &ldquo;I believe I won the fight last year. I was a victim of a hometown decision. I expect something different this time around,&rdquo; Liebenberg said.&ldquo;Preparations have been going well. I have been sparring with the best local talents in town as I prepare for this fight.&rdquo;To avoid a rigged decision, SunSport understands that the German&rsquo;s camp demanded a German judge to sit alongside a South African official and a neutral official.
