MANY football pundits regard the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations semifinal between Ghana&rsquo;s Black Stars and the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon at the Stade de Franceville tonight (9pm) as a &ldquo;final before the final&rdquo;.Both teams deserve to qualify for this year&rsquo;s final set for Stade de l&rsquo;Amiti&eacute;, Libreville, on Sunday, but just one of them can make it through to the big one.And their coaches &ndash; Ghana&rsquo;s Avram Grant and Cameroon&rsquo;s Hugo Broos &ndash; have travelled a long, muddy road with their teams to be where they are today.The Cameroonians, hosts of the 2019 Afcon, knocked out tournament favourites Senegal on penalties in a match that many punters had gifted to Aloiu Cisse&rsquo;s team.And the Ghanaians deserve a pat on the back for brushing aside cup contenders DR Congo.It has been a battle for the Black Stars, who had to rely on the experience of the Ayew brothers, Andre and Jordan, plus Asamoah Gyan after their kingpin, Abdul &ldquo;Baba&rdquo; Rahman, got injured early in the tournament. Many predicted that his injury would derail Ghana&rsquo;s campaign in the competition, but they have proved they have depth.Now, with Gyan also out with a suspected muscle sprain, the Cameroonians are hoping to capitalise on the situation. This is the Lions&rsquo; fourth semifinal appearance having last played in the 2008 edition against the very same Ghana. It is Ghana&rsquo;s sixth consecutive Afcon semifinal appearance as they continue to gun for the Afcon title they last won in 1982.The two teams&rsquo; 2008 Afcon semifinal tie was won 1-0 by Cameroon, with Alain N&rsquo;Kong slotting home the solitary goal in Accra, Ghana.The Black Stars have yet to bag a win against Cameroon at Afcon, while Cameroon only have the one victory over Ghana. The other two clashes ended in draws.Ghana came so close to winning Afcon in 2015 but the lottery of penalties saw Ivory Coast walk away with the coveted trophy.Reports have it that Grant is pushing his medical team very hard to have Gyan available for tonight&rsquo;s clash &ndash; which is not a pipe dream considering how desperate the talented striker is to win this year&rsquo;s cup.Grant said they lacked a quality striker of Gyan&rsquo;s calibre in the victory over the DRC, but he was relieved that Jordan Ayew was able to do the job before his brother, Andre, completed their two-goal cushion.&ldquo;We missed Gyan,&rdquo; Grant said. &ldquo;He is very experienced. But I think he is getting better. If he is okay we will give him a chance.&rdquo; Gyan smiled when quizzed about his fitness, saying: &ldquo;I want to play but only if this injury allows me to.&rdquo;
