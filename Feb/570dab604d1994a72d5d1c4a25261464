THE death of 94 mentally ill patients had barely sunk in when more families came forward to share stories of how their relatives died in non- governmental organisations. Last week, health ombudsman Malegapuru Makgoba released his report into the deaths of the patients transferred to various non-governmental organisations in Gauteng. The Mdluli family from Mofolo, Soweto is demanding the truth after the death of their relative, Vusi Mdluli (58). The family said Vusi died last year after being moved from Sterkfontein Hospital to an NGO called Khethimpilo.Bheki Mdluli (54), Vusi&rsquo;s older brother, said: &ldquo;My brother suffered a painful death. Doctors&rsquo; reports state he died of dehydration and starvation, but his death certificate indicates he died of natural causes.&ldquo;The last time we saw him alive was in June. He was very ill. &ldquo;We discovered he was sleeping on the floor and asked why he had no bed.&ldquo;We were told he couldn&rsquo;t control his bladder, so they couldn&rsquo;t give him a bed. &ldquo;A few weeks later we were told he had died.&rdquo;Thabo Mesebe, the provincial spokesman, said government is in talks with the committee representing the families. Gauteng Premier David Makhura has promised to implement the health ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations without delay.
