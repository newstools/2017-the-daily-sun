SUNDAY SUN reported last month that DJ Christos&rsquo;s marriage was allegedly a sham &ndash; after it was rumoured he found a new squeeze!It has now been claimed the new woman in his life is none other than DJ Sakhe Motshoene.Several sources have confirmed that the pair is dating, and Sakhe allegedly isn&rsquo;t hiding the fact that she&rsquo;s dating&nbsp; the DJ.A friend said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad about this whole thing, as Sakhe is young. To be the cause of another woman&rsquo;s misery knowingly is really not on!&rdquo;Another friend said it&rsquo;s unfair that wives always get blamed when their husbands go astray.&ldquo;The side chick must also bear the blame. Why must it always be the wife&rsquo;s problem when the man decides to bring problems into the marriage? Sakhe must take some of the blame.&rdquo;This has raised eyebrows in the music industry.DJ Sakhe is building her profile as a performer and is still working towards her big break.DJ Christos is a renowned DJ and producer, owner of the record label, Katsaitis Music.His wife, Tebogo, is building a name for herself as a businesswoman, events manager and DJ.DJ Sakhe said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not dating, but we do work together and that&rsquo;s how I know him.&rdquo;Tebogo said: &ldquo;I have no comment on whatever story you&rsquo;re writing.&rdquo;DJ Christos was unavailable for comment.
