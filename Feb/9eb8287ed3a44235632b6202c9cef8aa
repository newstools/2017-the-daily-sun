A SANGOMA accused of harassing his neighbours has been &shy;arrested. Yvonne Mmutlane (66), from Snake Park block 12 in Soweto, said for years the sangoma had been healing people in the kasi. However, about four years ago, things changed and Yvonne claims the sangoma started to act strangely and harass them.She said: &ldquo;He would just wake up and beat everyone he saw or throw stones at people&rsquo;s windows. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to see women wearing pants. He chases them down the street and strips them naked.&rdquo; Yvonne said Monday was the last straw for her because the sangoma broke her windows. &ldquo;I was scared and I thought he would beat me up. &ldquo;All I did was greet him and suddenly he started throwing stones at my windows.&rdquo; Yvonne said other residents, who were already gatvol of his behaviour, called cops and he was arrested. &ldquo;We are tired of his behaviour and we no longer want him in our street.&rdquo; Bheki Mazibuko, another neighbour, who also opened a case of assault against the sangoma, claimed that he was once beaten by the sangoma too. &ldquo;He broke my arms after breaking my house windows. I got him arrested,&rdquo; said Bheki.Richard Tshabalala (59) said he opened a case of harassment against the sangoma after he came to his house and insulted him.
