SHE thought she had met her true love on Facebook.But when the smart young woman realised she was being scammed, she decided to come forward and warn other women.Angry Lebohang Chauke (26) from Protea Glen, Soweto told Daily Sun how she almost became the victim of a con man.&ldquo;I met him on Facebook. We soon exchanged numbers and he then phoned me, saying he was from England,&rdquo; said Lebohang.She became suspicious as the man&rsquo;s accent didn&rsquo;t sound like someone from England. A few days later the man confessed his love and they started dating via social media. But the scam finally became clear when the online lover phoned again last Thursday, saying he had bought her clothes as a gift.&ldquo;He sent me pictures of the clothes, but when I asked him when he would be sending them, he said he had a technical problem with the courier in England and asked me to deposit R2 000 into their account.&ldquo;When I suggested he first pay the money into my account, he said he couldn&rsquo;t because of his financial situation. That&rsquo;s when I realised it was a scam!&rdquo; She pretended to play along.Then someone who pretended to be working for the courier called and told her that her goods had arrived at OR Tambo Airport.&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s accent sounded exactly the same as the one I was supposedly dating.&rdquo; Lebohang told the People&rsquo;s Paper she confronted the man and told him that she would report him to the police.&ldquo;He sent an SMS threatening to kill me, saying he knew where I lived.&rdquo;Moroka police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza warned people to be careful of those they met on dating sites. &ldquo;It is difficult to trace them as most of them don&rsquo;t use their actual details. &ldquo;They create fake emails and locations,&rdquo; he said.
