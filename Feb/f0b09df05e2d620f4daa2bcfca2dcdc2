THE MULTICHOICE Diski Challenge will go down to the wire once again and the champions will only be decided on 25 February, the final day of competition.With only one game left before the curtain goes down only two teams, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic, still have a chance of walking away with the title at the end of the day. Sundowns could have clinched the title with three games to spare, but the Young Brazilians made mistakes in crucial matches which dented their hopes of winning the league.Sundown suffered a 2-1 defeat to Maritzburg United last month and drew 1-1 with Free State Stars early this month. Celtic made all the right moves as Downs slipped up but their 3-2 defeat to Ajax Cape Town at King Zwelithini Stadium on the weekend ruined everything for the ambitious club.Downs are now back at the top of the table after edging Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 on the weekend. They lead the log table with 31 points. Celtic are second with 30 points. Sundowns mentor David Notoane told SunSport that it was a learning curve for his charges and that the pressure of being at the top of the table affected them, as Celtic kept a close chase on them.Sundowns will now face Cape Town City FC next on the final day of play, while Celtic take on improving Baroka FC. Said Notoane: &ldquo;We had to fight for the No 1 position and it has not been an easy fight. It&rsquo;s now or never for us, we know what is at stake. &ldquo;We need to make sure we get three points against City in the last game to wrap things up in style.&ldquo;When we were leading the table before, there was too much pressure, which the youngsters couldn&rsquo;t handle. Still, we did not throw in the towel, we remained hopeful.&rdquo;Notoane singled out 25-year-old striker Samuel Julies as their most influential player, who helped the team reclaim the top spot. &ldquo;Julies has been a key player for us, his experience has come into play at the right time.&rdquo;
