EFF GAUTENG has laid 94 murder charges against former MEC Qedani Mahlangu and Gauteng Premier David Makhura.They have also charged the 27 NGOs, transport providers and everyone else implicated in the death of the 94 Life Esidimeni Hospital patients.The ANCYL in Gauteng has also laid charges of culpable homicide and corruption against the former MEC.Chairman Matome Chiloane said: &ldquo;We are still appealing to the premier to resign. We are appealing to his conscience as the accounting officer.&rdquo;EFF chairwoman Mandisa Mashego said death does not move the ANC. The party laid the murder charges at Joburg Central Police Station.Mashego said it would not be fair to point a finger at only one person. &ldquo;Mahlangu cannot be held solely responsible. The whole cabinet and the premier should be held accountable. The problem with her is that historically, she does not listen. Every time we raised this issue at the legislature, we were reprimanded. As the EFF we are going to keep a hawk&rsquo;s eye on the case.&rdquo; Meanwhile, the Progressive Youth Alliance slammed what it called &ldquo;opportunistic elements seeking to gain cheap political mileage&rdquo; out of the tragedy. &ldquo;We call upon the ANCYL to desist from joining the agents of counter-revolution using this painful period . . . to attack the ANC.&rdquo;It gave the league seven days to withdraw a 14-day ultimatum to Makhura.
