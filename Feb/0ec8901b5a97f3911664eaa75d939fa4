A BIG showdown is looming between the South African Football Association (Safa) and Bidvest Wits over the release of red-hot striker, Phakamani Mahlambi.Wits has refused to release the on-form youngster for South Africa&rsquo;s Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations tournament taking place in Lusaka and Ndola from today until 12 March.On Friday, the local team left for Ndola without him, as coach Thabo Senong described Mahlambi&rsquo;s absence as a big blow.Yesterday, Safa claimed that an agreement was reached that Mahlambi would depart for Zambia today, after last night&rsquo;s match, in which Wits played against Mamelodi Sundowns. When asked about the possibility of Mahlambi joining Amajita in Zambia today, Wits coach Gavin Hunt said: &ldquo;You know where we stand about the Mahlambi issue.&rdquo;Hunt, has been adamant that his striker will not be playing in the Under-20 Afcon in Zambia.Senong&rsquo;s charges open their campaign against Cameroon at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola tomorrow night (6pm). Amajita have been drawn in Group B with Cameroon, Sudan and Senegal.Safa CEO, Dennis Mumble, had earlier said that football&rsquo;s motherbody would take strong action against Wits if they failed to release Mahlambi. According to Mumble, Safa were not going to dance to Wits&rsquo; tune and he made it clear that the country came first.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already notified the club that we will take action against it if it doesn&rsquo;t release the player,&rdquo; Mumble said. &ldquo;The bottom line is that the national team takes priority over the club, and we are not going to budge on this.&rdquo;The Safa CEO said it did not matter that the tournament fell outside the Fifa calendar. Said Mumble: &ldquo;A lot of clubs tend to fall back on the excuse of saying this tournament is not on Fifa calendar, but Safa is the one that proposed the international calendar to Fifa, and we know what the proposal behind that calendar is.&ldquo;Junior national teams don&rsquo;t fall under Fifa dates, but the national federation is responsible for that. So, we are going to act on the Mahlambi issue.&rdquo;Earlier in the week, Hunt maintained his stance and said: &ldquo;The club has made a decision not to release him, and it ends there. The club has made a decision, and that&rsquo;s how it works.&rdquo; Senong said Mahlambi was part of his main strategy in Ndola. &ldquo;Safa are handling the matter. We would like to have him because he is an important player,&rdquo; Senong said.Mahlambi said it was not his decision whether he goes to Zambia or not.&nbsp;
