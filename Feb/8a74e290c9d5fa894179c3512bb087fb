HE knows that choosing a coffin is a very distressing time. But Nikezile Ndlovu also knows that a beautiful coffin or casket can comfort a family during difficult times. The 28-year-old from Mtubatuba, northern KZN makes a living out of coffins and caskets. Nikezile&rsquo;s skill is what sets his designs apart from other coffin makers in town. &ldquo;I started Survivors Legacy in 2016 after I completed my training course in Joburg. I had enrolled for coffin and casket manufacturing at Trimo Training Consulting after sitting at home for more than seven years doing nothing.&rdquo; He said that was after he realised how good he was at woodwork. After matriculating in 2003, Nikezile used to make bedside tables for his family. &ldquo;I never thought that I would end up owning my own company. At first I struggled because I didn&rsquo;t have materials or a space to work from. But later on I approached a local councillor to give me space at the youth centre so that I could start making coffins.&rdquo;Nikezile uses the youth centre as his workshop and puts aside money to buy materials. He said he is not making lots of money but his business is promising as his clients are happy with what he offers.&ldquo;Some people say I am brave to make coffins because they are scary. But for me, coffins are my friends and I even rest inside them when I am tired.&rdquo; One of his clients, Siya Khumalo (32) from Khula Village in Mtubatuba, said: &ldquo;His coffins are affordable and beautiful. I used his service in December and I was very happy.&rdquo;
