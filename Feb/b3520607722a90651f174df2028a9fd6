&ldquo;I AM not Velaphi!&rdquo;Bafanyana Xulu (61), is tired of being teased.Velaphi is a name given to scooter drivers in the kasi to ridicule them. The nickname is taken from a television character named Velaphi, who was portrayed by Ray Ntlokwana in the &lsquo;90s.Velaphi was a messenger who did silly things and always got into trouble when he made deliveries on his scooter. Bafanyana from Lindelani, north of Durban said he was sick of being called Velaphi and decided to put two signs on his bike. One reads: &ldquo;uVelaphi unyoko&rdquo;, which means Velaphi is your mum.Below that he wrote &ldquo;Hallelujah amen. Born to attack&rdquo;, because he is a man of God who only attacks those who insult him.He said ever since he put up the signs, people have stopped making fun of him. &ldquo;I have been patient with the people who have been calling me Velaphi since 2007. But in 2012 I decided to put signs on my bike because pupils and taxi drivers keep mocking me.&rdquo; Resident Sipho Gazu (37) said they didn&rsquo;t mean to offend Bafanyana. &ldquo;We were just being affectionate because his bike reminds us of Velaphi.&rdquo;
