MAGISTRATE Essie Mukhari denied bail to Mark Scott-Crossley. The magistrate was delivering judgment on Scott-Crossley&rsquo;s bail bid at Naphuno Magistrates Court in Lenyenye, Limpopo on Friday. Advocate Johan Engelbrecht, Scott-Crossley&rsquo;s lawyer, told the court his client was sick and being kept in jail would jeopardise his health. Scott-Crossley (49) allegedly ran over Silence Mabunda (39) with his bakkie in Hoedspruit, Limpopo on 14 December. This was after the two men had an argument in town earlier that day. Mabunda claims he was assaulted by Scott-Crossley and had his cellphone smashed.Scott-Crossley handed himself over to the police in January. His attorney said he was not on the run, but had been on holiday. Investigating officer Captain Richard Boshomane told the court Scott-Crossley paid a R4 000 fine in 2006 for assaulting an inmate in Barberton Prison in Mpumalanga, where he was serving a five-year sentence for throwing Nelson Chisale into a lion&rsquo;s den. &ldquo;He has other pending cases of theft and three of assault. &ldquo;He might interfere and intimidate witnesses if released,&rdquo; said Captain Boshomane.Silence&rsquo;s brother, Jan Mabunda (40), along with ANC and EFF members who had come to offer support, welcomed the judgment. The matter has been postponed to 24 March while police continue with their investigation.
