HE WAS only 11 years old when he started surfing at Muizenberg Beach, in the Western Cape with a damaged board.But that is a distant memory for 28-year-old Kwezi Qika, South Africa&rsquo;s first black longboarding champion.After winning the South African Junior Longboard Championship in 2005, Kwezi went on to compete at the International Surfing Association&rsquo;s world championships in California and France, climbing to 43rd in the world rankings in 2007.The surfer from Ocean View, Cape Town said he was drawn to the ocean as a child. But he was unable to swim and too embarrassed to admit it, he stayed on shore while others were swimming.&ldquo;We would sit on the beach watching surfers in the water,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Eventually, I went into the water. &ldquo;After I stood on a board for the first time, I was hooked. &ldquo;I surfed for two years before I learned how to swim.&rdquo;He said he enjoyed the sport so much he started entering competitions. With the help of Gary Kleynhans, a former surfing champion and owner of a surf school, Kwezi started competing in national tournaments. He said he loves the ocean, but it demands respect.&ldquo;The ocean is like a woman you respect. She&rsquo;s that lady who can smack you as soon as you think you&rsquo;re the best.&rdquo;
