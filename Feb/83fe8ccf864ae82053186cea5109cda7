IT IS now down the wire! The Multichoice Diski Challenge (MDC) will on Sunday leave spectators on the edge of their seats as Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City cross swords in the final showdown of the tournament.Despite suffering a setback of being docked a point for fielding a suspended player (Thabang Sibanyoni), Sundowns are still favourites to walk away with the title against Cape Town City at Sinaba Stadium (12pm). Downs are leading the MDC table with 31 points, only separated by a single point from Celtic in second place. Celtic will on Sunday face Baroka FC at Tsakane Stadium at the same time.Sundowns, who have finished as runners up the past two seasons, will enter their clash against City in similar fashion to last season when they were leading the log after 14 games.The Brazilians need to win against City to win the trip to the Netherlands as a draw would put them at risk should Celtic win their match. The MDC champions will tour the Netherlands from 17-26 March.Sundowns mentor David Notoane is confident that they will be crowned champions on Sunday. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need to worry about Celtic. They are the ones who should worry about us. Last year we were worried about Golden Arrows,&rdquo; he said. The Brazilians will be without their target man Sibanyoni. Keletso Makgalwa and Samuel Julies are expected to shine for Sundowns to help them lift this year&rsquo;s championship trophy.SuperSport will broadcast both matches live. The Sundowns-City encounter will primarily be on screen with a split screen used to intermittently cross over to the Celtic-Baroka match every five minutes and immediately whenever a goal is scored.The Diski Challenge activations team will also be handing out tickets at different locations in and around both townships tomorrow and Saturday. Each fan will be allocated two tickets.
