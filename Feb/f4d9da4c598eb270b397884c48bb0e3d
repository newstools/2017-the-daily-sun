The Premier Soccer League has charged Mamelodi Sundowns and their player Thabang Sibanyoni with contravening Rule 55.1 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code and the NSL Rule 54.1.4. This is after Mamelodi Sundowns fielded Sibanyoni in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge fixture on 04 December 2016 despite the player having accumulated four yellow cards and therefore making him ineligible to take the field by reason of automatic suspension for one match.&nbsp;Mamelodi Sundowns and Sibanyoni will appear in front of a Disciplinary Committee convened by the League on O8 February 2017.&nbsp;
