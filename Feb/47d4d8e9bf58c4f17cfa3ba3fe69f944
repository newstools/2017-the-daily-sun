WITH the Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations (U-20 Afcon) tournament around the corner, Mzansi U-20 coach Thabo Senong is collecting the final pieces of the puzzle. Senong and his junior national team are in the final stages of their preparations ahead of the eight-nations tournament in Ndola and Lusaka, in Zambia, from 26 February to 12 March. Amajita have been drawn in group B with Senegal, Cameroon and Sudan. They will play two friendly games against pre-tournament favourites Mali in Polokwane today and on Sunday before Senong announces his final squad for the U-20 Afcon. Mali have been drawn in group A with host nation Zambia, Egypt and Guinea. The top four teams at the youth tournament will automatically book a spot at the Under-20 World Cup finals in South Korea in May. Speaking at the SAB league skills camp in Pretoria earlier this week, Senong was beaming with confidence as he addressed coaches who had earned their Caf Level C coaching licences. Amajita lost 2-1 to Zambia in a warm-up game last week. Senong said: &ldquo;The players are in camp working hard and the morale is high. It will be a dream come true if we qualify. But our focus is on the opening game against Cameroon (27 February).&rdquo; Amajita will travel to Zambia on 23 February to start their bid to qualify for the World Cup. Senong said the SA Football Association was talking with clubs in Europe, including Braga and Sporting of Portugal, regarding players, as well as with Bidvest Wits locally, to negotiate the release of red hot striker Phakamani Mahlambi. Ajax Cape Town midfielder Grant Margeman joined the team on their trip to Limpopo yesterday.
