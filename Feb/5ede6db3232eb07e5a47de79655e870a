PROPHET Light Monyeki of Grace Living Hope Ministries from Soshanguve, Pretoria held a conference over the past weekend.&nbsp; On Sunday the prophet mixed deadly poison Rattex,in water and gave some members of the congregation to drink.&nbsp; This was to demonstrate power by faith as said on the Grace Living Hope Ministries Facebook page.&nbsp; The caption said, " The man of God, Prophet Light Monyeki demonstrates power of faith by causing congregants to drink Rattax; deadly poison to show forth their faith. As he was doing that he said &ldquo;we do not need to proclaim faith because we are believers. If nyope boys can smoke Rattax for more than 8years, who are we? Death has no power over us&rdquo;. Then he declared life from above upon the water mixed with Rattax; and spoke nourishment unto bodies and healing unto the sick. A multitude of congregants voluntarily ran to the front to have a drink of the deadly poison. After declaring nourishment and healing, Prophet Light was the first one to drink.".&nbsp;
