THE family of a kidnapped boy cannot sleep because they fear for his safety.Vusumzi Mabude (14) from Oliver Tambo&rsquo;s home village of Nkantolo, in Bizana, was last seen when he left for school on Friday.His mum Bhekiswa (45) said when she saw his school uniform in the house, she assumed he had changed clothes and gone to his uncle&rsquo;s house, where he and his cousins herd livestock together. But when she phoned his uncle&rsquo;s wife on Saturday she was shocked to hear that her son had never come to his uncle&rsquo;s house! The distressed mum rushed to the cop shop and reported her son&rsquo;s disappearance. The next day, she and three close family members received SMSes threatening to kill Vusumzi if they didn&rsquo;t pay up! The SMS demanded R6 000 from the boy&rsquo;s father, Vuyisile Mabude, who works in Joburg. The message said Vuyisile owed the kidnapper money for a job done in December. The message threatened to dump the boy&rsquo;s body in a donga if the money was not paid. The SMS also said that the boy was being kept in Flagstaff, a nearby town. Relative Akhona Njenjana (31) said he called the number and a man who spoke isiZulu answered.&ldquo;He said he wanted the money deposited through Spar by Monday morning 11am.&rdquo;The family said the man called again yesterday, angry that they had not met his deadline. Bhekiswa said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat, not knowing where my eldest child is and whether he&rsquo;s eating.&rdquo;Brigadier Mthuthuzeli Mtukushe confirmed that a missing person&rsquo;s case was opened. Officers are investigating.
