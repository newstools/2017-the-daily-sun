Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka believes that the club can only make further progress after defeating Free State Stars 3-1 in Tuesday's Premiership clash.The Glamour Boys started 2017 in convincing fashion with the victory over Ea Lla Koto with Siphiwe Tshabalala, Bernard Parker and Willard Katsande bagging the goals. Rooi Mahamutsa grabbed a late consolation for Stars.Maluleka, who is reportedly in the process of extending his deal at Naturena, starred for Chiefs as he took home Man of the Match honours.He told the club's official website: "We fought very hard, we could have killed the game off in the first half because we had a couple of chances that we should have put away."I think in the second half, they came at us and we drifted back a bit more but as the game went on, we scored the third one. We were looking to get the three points today, pick up from where we left off before the break. So from here we can only go forward."The Steve Komphela-coached outfit next face Maritzburg United in the league on Saturday. The action gets underway from 20:15 at Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg.
