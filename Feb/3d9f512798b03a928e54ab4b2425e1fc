DUMISANI Chauke&rsquo;s star keeps shining bright. The Baby Proteas assistant coach, who was just appointed the new Limpopo Baobabs mentor, is looking to elevate the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League side to greater heights. Chauke was the assistant of Jenny van Dyk at the Gauteng Jaguars last season.The Baobabs had a tough first two seasons in the league, struggling to compete with stronger teams and finishing at the bottom of the standings. The former netball Proteas player said her aim for this season was to get the Limpopo side to eighth in the standings. Said Chauke: &ldquo;It will be tough but we can&rsquo;t do worse than the last two seasons. This is an opportunity for me to grow as a head coach.&rdquo;The Malamulele-born mentor faces the struggle of not training with her charges every day, as she is based in Tshwane. However, she said their weekly training camps would have the players ready for the tournament, which starts in April. She added: &ldquo;The players have individual programmes that will keep them sharp as we work on getting ready for the competition. The challenge is that many of the girls live all over Limpopo, while some are in Gauteng. &ldquo;Once the competition starts, the girls in Polokwane will meet with assistant coach Elmarie Craig twice every week, while the ones around here will meet with me.&rdquo;Another challenge is that the players are full-time students and employees, who may not be able to make it to all the training sessions.
