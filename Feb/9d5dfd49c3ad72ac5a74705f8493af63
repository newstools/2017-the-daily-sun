LEADER of the EFF in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe, was arrested on Friday. It happened during the state of the province address. This time, Sedibe has been charged with fraud. He appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate Court and was granted R1000 bail. Sedibe&rsquo;s arrest came soon after the sitting started, when chaos erupted in the chamber. Sedibe and other EFF MPs were escorted out of the chamber by the police. &ldquo;I do not know why I&rsquo;m being arrested,&rdquo; said Sedibe while sitting in the back of his car under the watchful eye of a cop. &ldquo;Right now, as you can see, they are escorting me to the police station so I can be charged. &ldquo;As soon I am aware of the charges, I will let you know. &ldquo;Let them arrest me.&rdquo;But EFF MPs would not let their leader be marched off to the back of the police van. They dared the cops to arrest them as well. They pushed and challenged the cops to arrest ANC MPs as well.&ldquo;We have opened many cases against some of the ANC people who are sitting in the chamber,&rdquo; said EFF secretary Alfred Skhosana. &ldquo;We demand that the police arrest them too. &ldquo;We opened cases from 2015, but nothing has happened yet. &ldquo;If the law operates equally, the ANC people must be arrested too.&ldquo;These are cheap political games and these people won&rsquo;t stop us. &ldquo;The struggle will continue. We will follow up on all the cases we opened against the corrupt leaders of the ANC who remain in the chamber. We want to see justice being served.&rdquo;Brigadier Leonard Hlathi confirmed Sedibe&rsquo;s arrest, and said that he will appear in court today. However, he wouldn&rsquo;t say more about the charges.
