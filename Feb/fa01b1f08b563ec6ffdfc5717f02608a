HOME Affairs has given new Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret the thumbs up to start working in Mzansi from today. The department&rsquo;s spokesman, Thabo Makgola, told SunSport yesterday that they would issue the Swedish-born mentor with an authorisation to start his job immediately. This means Jonevret might be on the Bucs bench for the first time when they host Polo&shy;kwane City at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). His next match is the Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on 4 March. The 54-year-old mentor replaced Muhsin Ertugral, who resigned in November last year following Pirates&rsquo; humiliating 6-1 defeat to SuperSport United in the league.Jonevret joined Pirates on a three-year deal on Monday. Makgola explained: &ldquo;We received his work permit application, but there are still outstanding documents that he needs to provide us with. In the meantime we will issue him an authorisation to work. This allows him to work in the country fonot more than 90 days while we process his application.&rdquo;Pirates submitted Jonevret&rsquo;s application on Tuesday and were due to receive the authorisation before the close of business yesterday.Jonevret, who will be assisted by Harold &ldquo;Jazzy&shy;queen&rdquo; Lekgodi and Benson &ldquo;Mayanga&rdquo; Mhlongo, has a huge task to halt Bucs&rsquo; downward slide. The hard-to-please Pirates fans are yet to recover from the terrible 6-0 thrashing at the hands of Mamelodi Sundowns, which was marred by violence at Loftus Versfeld. The violence prompted Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza to hire a permanent coach in a bid to end their slump.
