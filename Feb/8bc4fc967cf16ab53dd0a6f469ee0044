MANDLA Masango is enjoying his new lease of life at SuperSport United under head coach Stuart Baxter.Masango won the Absa Premiership and MTN8 in 2014-15 under Baxter before joining Danish club Randers.Baxter swooped to sign Masango (27) on loan in the January transfer window and the move has paid dividends.Masango, who joined United three weeks ago, won the Man of the Match award on Wednesday when his two goals in just under a minute helped sink Maritzburg United 4-1 at the Lucas Moripe Stadium, keeping Matsatsantsa in the title race.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be back,&rdquo; said Masango.&ldquo;But the three points are more important than the award. I am happy to be back with coach Stuart. He brings out the best in me and the other players. He is like a father figure to me.&rdquo;On his future Masango said there was a possibility he could make his move to United permanent at the end of the season: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy here. It&rsquo;s a great club with fantastic players, anything is possible. We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see what happens.&rdquo;Baxter was thrilled to have Masango back: &ldquo;He has been great. I did not want to rush him.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s like coming home for Masango, with five former ex-Chiefs teammates in the squad. Said Baxter: &ldquo;He is comfortable and knows the dressing-room, which helps him settle.&rdquo; He will play Masango in a new role: &ldquo;He will play more wide.&rdquo;The coach was happy with his side&rsquo;s second half blitz against the Team of Choice. But he hinted he would make a few changes for tomorrow&rsquo;s clash with struggling Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium (8.15pm). &ldquo;I will see how the legs feel in training,&rdquo; he said.He could be minus striker Kingston Nkhatha, who scored on Wednesday, and defender Onismor Bhasera.Said Baxter: &ldquo;Kingston came off with a knee injury while Bash was involved in a car accident and is still not 100%.&rdquo;He is wary of Highlands: &ldquo;Like Maritzburg, they are a potential banana skin, so we&rsquo;ll take nothing for granted.&rdquo;Maritzburg head coach Roger de Sa was disappointed with his side in the second half after they led at the break through a Kurt Lentjies goal: &ldquo;We made a couple of schoolboy errors in the second half. They are a quality side and if you make those kinds of mistakes they will hurt you &ndash; and they did.&rdquo;Maritzburg host Free State Stars at Harry Gwala Stadium on Sunday and De Sa warned: &ldquo;We have to pull up our socks. I believe we have the character to bounce back.&rdquo;
