BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt believes the points they dropped in the first round of the season could come back to haunt them at the end of the campaign.The Clever Boys beat Orlando Pirates 2-1 in an Absa Premiership match at Orlando Stadium midweek to register their third win in eight matches.Although the victory saw the Students return to the top of table, Hunt is still haunted by the results of five matches they played last year. &ldquo;Look, we had five bad games before Christmas where I think we conceded a goal in the 95th minute to Cape Town City (lost 3-2), in the 94th minute to Highlands Park (2-2) and Maritzburg United (1-1) also scored right at the end as well. &ldquo;We drew at least three games which certainly would have got us up the table a bit farther. We were not playing badly, just conceding poor goals. We had a bad run and if you look at the league, we cannot afford to do that. &ldquo;We pulled ourselves back into the pack, where we could have been six or seven points clear at the top. Be that as it may, we just have to keep going.&rdquo;Hunt stressed that his charges would need to improve their performance when they tackle Reunion Island side Saint-Louisienne in the second leg of the Caf Champions League preliminary round at Bidvest Stadium tomorrow (6pm). Wits scored a crucial away goal at the weekend despite losing the first leg 2-1. Wits winger Gabadinho Mhango, who scored the goal, will hope to continue his rich vein of form, also having scored twice in their victory over Bucs.&ldquo;What we did at the weekend was taxing, especially with the heat. We played at night, the pitch was heavy, it was difficult. I have no doubt we can beat them at home.&rdquo;
