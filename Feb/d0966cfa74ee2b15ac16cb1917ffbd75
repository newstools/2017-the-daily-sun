EPHRAIM &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba failed in his bid to get re-instated as Bafana Bafana head coach after a CCMA hearing yesterday.But Mashaba is not going down without a fight and will now take his dismissal by the SA Football Association to arbitration.Mashaba was fired in December by a Safa disciplinary committee when he was found guilty of gross misconduct, insubordination and bringing Safa into disrepute.However, Mashaba&rsquo;s lawyer Claudio Bollo said last night: &ldquo;Regrettably we were not able to mediate a successful resolution of this case at the CCMA. So we are taking the matter to arbitration.&rdquo;Bollo is hoping to have a date set for the arbitration hearing in the next few days.Said Bollo: &ldquo;We believe we have a strong case to get Mashaba re-instated as Bafana coach and that is why we decided to go to arbitration.&rdquo; Bollo also disclosed that he will be in court on 14 February in a bid to interdict the SA Football Association from appointing a new Bafana head coach before the arbitration case is finalised.Said Bollo: &ldquo;It would be pointless for Safa to bring in another coach until this matter is resolved. That is why we want to block any such appointment.&rdquo;Bollo said if they fail to get Mashaba re-instated they would seek compensation from Safa. Mashaba still has 18 months to run on his contract.
