Riky Rick caused a stir with his acceptance speech at this year&rsquo;s Metro FM awards last night.When Riky&rsquo;s Sidlukotini won the award for Best Hit Single last night and he went up to collected the award, no one was ready for the statement he was about to make.The rap superstar starts his acceptance speech by saying &ldquo;I thought I would be more excited to get this, if you know my raps you know what I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;He then goes on to add fuel to fire over rumours speculating that artists from Mabala Noise and Ambitiouz Entertainment had their awards paid for.&ldquo;Shout out to all the kids that never get on radio, that can&rsquo;t get their song played on radio because they don&rsquo;t have enough money. Shout out to all the kids who put out music videos, that never get their music videos played on TV because they don&rsquo;t have the money,&rdquo; he said on stage.He then went on to call out the content that he hears on radio, at an award ceremony hosted by a radio station, so spicy.&ldquo;90% of the s*** I hear on radio is garbage. If you&rsquo;re a kid watching this right now, forget radio. If they don&rsquo;t let you play on radio you better go to the internet and make your songs pop on the internet,&rdquo; he continued.And then his mic was cut.This caused a social media eruption of reactions to what Riky said.One person who agreed with him, was world-renowned dj, Black Coffee.The artist took to Twitter in his own rant to share his thoughts on the state of SA radio stations.&ldquo;I guess we've been quiet for too long.....Respects to @rikyrickworld for speaking the truth,&rdquo; he said on Twitter.Black Coffee also went on to say that Metro FM should stick to their day jobs.&ldquo;This is definitely not helping the Culture..Most Artist before us died poor...we are trying to fix our industry. Help &nbsp;us instead,&rdquo; he said.After having his mic cut, Riky took to Twitter to speak his mind. He started by saying that radio stations should not play with us because we are not stupid.&ldquo;"If n****z can pay for these f****** awards then my n***a I dont want them..." - RIKY RICK 2016,&rdquo; he said on Twitter.Watch Riky's acceptance speech here:STOP PLAYING WITH THE PEOPLE...
