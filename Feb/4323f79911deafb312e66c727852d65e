OTHER kids have by now settled in at school, ready to tackle the rest of the academic year.But Nokuthula Mkhize&rsquo;s 16-year-old son, Sipho, is sitting at home.This comes after he was allegedly &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; from a high school in Durban two weeks ago for refusing to take subjects he didn&rsquo;t want to do.Nokuthula (61) from Mayville said Sipho wanted to do geography, life science and history, but his teacher allegedly said he could only take tourism and hospitality.&ldquo;Sipho did not do well in those subjects the previous year, and when I went to inquire, I was told that the classes for the subjects he wanted to do were full,&rdquo; claimed Nokuthula.She said she asked his teacher how the class could be full as her son had been in the same school since grade 8.&ldquo;The next thing was that my son was given a transfer letter. The teacher didn&rsquo;t ask me if I was okay with that and I didn&rsquo;t request it.&rdquo;Nokuthula said she&rsquo;s been looking for a new school for her son since then but with no luck.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that my son will end up taking drugs.&ldquo;He leaves home in the mornings and only returns at night,&rdquo; she said, adding that she was very disappointed with how the teacher handled the matter.&ldquo;Even the school principal didn&rsquo;t have time for me when I was at school,&rdquo; claimed Nokuthula.She wants the department of education to intervene.Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KZN MEC for Education, Mthandeni Dlungwana, said Nokuthula should contact the district office as soon as possible.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have a pupil sitting at home at this time of the year,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.
