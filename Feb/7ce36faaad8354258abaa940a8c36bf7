Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says that most foreigners don't understand the importance of the FA Cup like their English counterparts.United face Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in a fifth round clash on Sunday, and said that he has learnt during his time in England to give the world's oldest club competition the "respect" it deserves.&ldquo;Maybe we foreign managers... not everybody studies and understands the culture of this country," Mourinho told the press ahead of Sunday's match."[The upsets are] because of attitude. Because you think it's easy and it's not easy. Also, the lower leagues' teams are getting better and better."Maybe we don't have as many English managers with that culture as we should."Mourinho admitted that he didn't always regard the FA Cup as important as he does now, citing a surprise defeat to Newcastle in the competition. In 2005, Mourinho's Chelsea side played the Magpies in the League Cup final over Liverpool and Champions League against Barcelona."I gambled too much, I focused too much on Barcelona and Liverpool," he continued."It was good because we beat Barcelona and we won the final against Liverpool, but the feeling I threw it away was not good, so I don't throw it away."If I lose, I lose because the opponent was better or because we didn't play well, but I'm not going to throw it away."I'm going to Blackburn with that respect. I go serious."I am going to change a few players, but am going with a good team because I respect the competition a lot and Manchester United demands that you go serious to every game."
