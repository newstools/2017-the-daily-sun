BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic&rsquo;s MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach Duncan Lechesa is not pressing any panic buttons ahead of their last game of the season on Sunday. Lechesa is fully aware that it is no longer in their hands who is crowned 2016-17 MDC champions, with Mamelodi Sundowns also in close contention. Celtic will keep their fingers crossed on Sunday that Cape Town City do them a big favour by beating Sundowns, who are almost home and dry with the Diski Challenge title.The City of Ekurhuleni will host an historic event as the two main games of the weekend will be played simultaneously within 35km from one another for the first time. Sundowns and City will battle it out at Sinaba Stadium, while Celtic will be up against Baroka FC at Tsakane Stadium at the same time (12pm) on Sunday. Victory for Sundowns will see them lay their hands on the MDC trophy and end Celtic&rsquo;s dream of being crowned champions &ndash; no matter the result of Celtic&rsquo;s encounter with tricky Baroka.Sundowns go into this game leading the MDC table with 31 points, while Celtic are second in the table with 30 points &ndash; one point behind the leaders. These two teams have been neck-and-neck in the past four matches and it&rsquo;s now or never for both teams. Celtic coach Lechesa said: &ldquo;This season we have done exceptionally well and we are proud of that. &ldquo;We face unpredictable Baroka next and it will be a tough encounter for us. It is not in our hands, we just need to go there and get maximum points.&rdquo; The winning team will get a trip to Netherlands where they will participate in an MDC international cup that will be played for the first time this season.
