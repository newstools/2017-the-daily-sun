Mamelodi Sundowns star Anthony Laffor has expressed his delight and gratitude at extending his deal with the champions of Africa for a further two years.The Liberia international, who played an influential role in helping Downs to bag their maiden title in Africa's most prestigious club competition, also revealed his gratitude to everyone with an interest in his career at Chloorkop.He told the club's official website: "When I went back home to Liberia I took my Champions League winning jersey to the president of the country (Ellen Johnson Sirleaf) and I want to continue doing so in future."I have a better opportunity here at Sundowns to play against the best in the continent and the world, hence I chose Sundowns. I'm eternally grateful to the club president, coaches and the supporters for the support and love."Laffor is likely to be involved when the Brazilians resume their league campaign against Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium.
