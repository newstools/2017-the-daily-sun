IT WILL be sink or swim for Highlands Park when the Absa Premiership resumes on Tuesday. Surviving relegation is non-negotiable for the Premiership rookies.The Tembisa-based outfit have been told to pull up their socks in the second half of the season and save the sinking ship. Highlands have the worst defensive record in the league, having conceded 29 goals in 15 matches. They are second from bottom on the log with 13 points. But the mandate going into the second round of matches is clear for the rookies &ndash; they have to avoid the dreaded axe at all costs. Veteran coach Gordon Igesund worked hard during the club&rsquo;s camp in Cape Town on repairing their leaky defence. Avoiding defeat in their opening two games against Cape Town City in the Mother City on Tuesday and against Polokwane City at Makhulong Stadium next Sunday will be a step in the right direction. Led by their veteran football administrator Sinky Mnisi, Highlands donated football equipment to schools around the famous kasi yesterday as part of their campaign to reinvest in their community. And they realise it would be catastrophic for their passionate Tembisa fans to see their team go down. Defender Eddie Ngalo says they have been working hard in their bid to survive the axe. Ngalo told SunSport: &ldquo;Our biggest objective is to survive relegation. We played a couple of friendlies in Cape Town and the coach has implemented some of his plans. Things are looking good.&rdquo; Mnisi emphasised the importance of maintaining the club&rsquo;s status and believes 32 points will guarantee their survival: &ldquo;Our biggest problem is the defence, but we have plugged some holes. We won&rsquo;t leak too many goals any more.&rdquo;Siyabonga Nhlapo, on loan from Bidvest Wits, is one of the defenders that has been roped in.
