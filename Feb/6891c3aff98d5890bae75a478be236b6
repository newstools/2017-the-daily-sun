Alex Mthiyane, Gagasi FM presenter, lodged a complaint at the Press Ombudsman about the article.&nbsp;In the article we stated: &ldquo;A source said Alex appeared at the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court&hellip;&rdquo; We retract the statement in the article that Mthiyane appeared in court. There is no evidence that he did appear in court. The charge against him about a missing cellphone had been withdrawn.&nbsp;Visit www.presscouncil.org.za for the full finding.
