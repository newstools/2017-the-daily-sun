MAMELODI Sundowns&rsquo; MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) coach, David Notoane, will travel to the Netherlands with younger players to allow them to get a glimpse of European football during their upcoming tour of the country.The MDC champions will be in the Netherlands from 17-26 March, where they will play in two matches and compete for the MDC International Cup. Said Notoane: &ldquo;At Sundowns we are on the global stage, the opportunity to go to the Netherlands means the boys get to test their skills at the level our first team is used to. For me, from a tactical point of view, it&rsquo;s an opportunity to rub shoulders with the coaches out there and pick up one or two tips.&rdquo;Notoane admits it wasn&rsquo;t easy finally taking the title after finishing second in the last two seasons. He said they didn&rsquo;t talk much about how they had lost out to Golden Arrows last year, although he reminded them that they wouldn&rsquo;t want to go through that experience again. The former Amajita assistant coach applauded the PSL for organising their match and that of Bloemfontein Celtic at different venues.He said: &ldquo;We worked hard psychologically to make the players believe that until it is mathematically impossible to win, we will keep fighting. We looked at last season &ndash; and it hurt.&rdquo; Sundowns striker Keletso Makgalwa, who harbours ambitions of playing for the first team, said they worked hard to get the title. He said: &ldquo;Now I feel ready and confident enough to play for the first team.&rdquo;Midfielder Tlotlo Leepile hopes the trip to the Netherlands will help him get a move back to Europe. Leepile was based in Portugal before coming back to Mzansi to join Sundowns. &ldquo;I like playing in Europe because there are more opportunities for me to become a better player,&rdquo; he said.
