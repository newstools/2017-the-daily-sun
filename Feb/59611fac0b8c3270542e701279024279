WHEN a father went to check on his seven-year-old son on Sunday, he was shocked to find he had a bruised back.The son allegedly told him that his mother (24) moered him with a stick because he had burst a waterpipe in the kasi.Now the father (31), from Umlazi, south of Durban is fuming because he suspects his son is being abused.&ldquo;I know that when children have done something wrong, their parents punish them. But this is abuse.&rdquo; He said his son, who lives in Umlazi with his mother, tells him that his mum beats him when he makes mistakes.&ldquo;I use to think my son was exaggerating until now. I tried to speak to his mother. &ldquo;She told me I have no say because I haven&rsquo;t paid her family for damages for making her pregnant. She added that I can&rsquo;t take him to live with me until I&rsquo;ve paid the damages.&rdquo; He told Daily Sun that he does piece jobs to survive and can&rsquo;t afford to pay.The mother said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt him like that. It&rsquo;s just that I was angry that he burst the pipe. &ldquo;Children are beaten when they&rsquo;re naughty. That doesn&rsquo;t make it abuse. I admit that I hurt my son but it wasn&rsquo;t my intention.&rdquo; Ncumisa Ndelu, a KZN Department of Social Development spokeswoman, advised the father to report the matter to social workers.&ldquo;They will investigate and act in the interests of the child.&rdquo;
