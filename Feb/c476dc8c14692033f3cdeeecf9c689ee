The last two years have been hell on earth for Priscilla.&nbsp; She lives in fear, wondering which of her children will be the next to die.&nbsp; Of her eight children, four have died by the bullet.&nbsp; &ldquo;My family is cursed and we don&rsquo;t know what to do to avoid the next deadly bullet,&rdquo; said Priscilla Sithole (58) from Lawley, near Lenasia, Gauteng.&nbsp; &ldquo;My children keep on dying and they all die the same way. They all get shot.&rdquo; She said she had eight children, six boys and two girls, and four of the boys have been killed in separate incidents. &ldquo;At this rate I fear my children will continue dying and I will be left with none at all.&rdquo; She said her ordeal began when her firstborn, Bandile Sithole (26), was killed on 11 April 2015 after being struck by five bullets while driving a taxi.&nbsp;&ldquo;He died in front of his passengers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In August that year his twin brother Bayanda was shot by an unknown man while visiting his girlfriend. In September last year her youngest, Banele (20) was also brutally murdered when he was attacked in their house during an ambush. &ldquo;I was also shot five times. I spent two months in hospital but I survived. My son died.&rdquo; The fourth son, Odwa (25), died on 11 February. He was invited to a DJ&rsquo;s gig in which he also took part. &ldquo;During the night he came back to eat and told us he was going back to fetch his equipment. That was the last time I saw my son.&nbsp; &ldquo;Later we received news he was shot by unknown men while packing up his equipment.&rdquo; Sister Lolo Sithole (27) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We all fear for our lives because of the way my brothers are dying. We are hoping for some kind of divine intervention.&rdquo; Police spokesman Aubrey Moopeloa confirmed a case of murder has been opened and said police are still investigating the latest case.&nbsp;&nbsp;
