THE ward councillor believes the electricity problem can be solved, but it will need commitment from the people. Zanele Khumalo, ward 62 councillor in eThekwini, told Daily Sun yesterday that Fairbreeze residents in Tongaat, KZN needed to notify her of any suspected izinyoka so that she can report them to the police and the municipality. This follows an ongoing protest during which residents closed the R102 with burning tyres and rubbish, demanding to have their lights back on. They have been in the dark since Sunday.She said she has called Eskom technicians to fix the problem but she fears the lights will soon go off again.&ldquo;People steal cables and make illegal connections which makes it difficult to solve the problem permanently.&rdquo; Sam Ntombela, a resident and ward committee member, said: &ldquo;Protesting residents are asking why they are the ones who experience power cuts while those in the suburbs always have electricity.&rdquo;He agreed that the izinyoka problem troubled them but said that was a long time ago. &ldquo;At the moment we can&rsquo;t be sure what causes the power failure because all the izinyoka we knew of back then were reported and jailed.&rdquo;Resident Nontombi Ncube (36) said she threw away all the meat in her fridge yesterday because it was rotten.Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, said a case of illegal gathering is being investigated by the Tongaat cops.She said a group of about 250 people from Magwaveni were protesting. &ldquo;They blockaded the R102 road with burning tyres and rubbish. No injuries were reported.&rdquo;
