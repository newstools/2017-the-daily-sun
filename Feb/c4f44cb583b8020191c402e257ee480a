PITSO Mosimane says it would be unfair to judge fringe players on their performance in Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; 1-1 draw with Chippa United on Tuesday. Mosimane had made eight changes to his starting lineup for the Absa Premiership clash with Chippa.&ldquo;It is very difficult to judge them on a pitch like this but they gave me their bodies, they gave me their legs,&rdquo; Mosimane said. &ldquo;They tried, they fought. But football should not be about fighting, it should be about playing. Conditions forced us to fight.&ldquo;It reminded me of the Africa Cup of Nations where the west Africans use their body strength &ndash; and they can manage in poor conditions. I don&rsquo;t want to be too critical about this game, that would be unfair. I&rsquo;m happy with the point, given the conditions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking home the point and am trying not to be too greedy.This reminds me of the point we got against Ajax Cape Town last season, which was crucial for us. We could have lost but got a point. &ldquo;But I think we had more chances. Teko Modise could have used his experience in the first half at the back post when he hesitated. Again in the second half, he made a different decision when he should have brought it down and slotted it home. Leo Castro also missed a soft one.&ldquo;But we all tried, that&rsquo;s all I can ask for,&rdquo; the coach said.Mosimane is now gearing up for Saturday&rsquo;s Caf Super Cup final against DR Congo giants TP Mazembe at Loftus Versfeld. The Downs coach will be a lot happier with the Loftus pitch. &ndash; MZANSI FOOTBALL
