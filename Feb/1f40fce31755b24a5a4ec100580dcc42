THE GLOVES have come off in the row between the SA Football Association (Safa) and Bidvest Wits! The Clever Boys have refused to release their red hot striker, Phakamani Mahlambi, for the Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations in Lusaka and Ndola, Zambia, from 26 February to 12 March. Amajita coach Thabo Senong announced his final squad for the Youth Afcon but the Clever Boys, via CEO Jose Ferreira, have made it known that their star player is going nowhere. Safa CEO Dennis Mumble said, however, that they would fight Wits on this matter. He threatened the Clever Boys with legal action if the Under-20s leave for Zambia without the in-form player. The competition falls outside Fifa calendar dates but Safa has vowed to fight the club with all its might to force them to release the 19-year-old former Transnet School of Excellence midfielder.Mumble insists that Safa calls the shots and that Wits have no choice but to play by the rules. Mumble said: &ldquo;We have included him (Mahlambi) in the final squad for Zambia and we expect the club to release him. &ldquo;We have already notified the club that we are going to take legal action if they fail to release him. &ldquo;The bottom line is Safa takes priority.&ldquo;The country comes before the club and we are not buying into the excuse that this competition does not fall on Fifa dates. &ldquo;Safa makes the rules in the junior competition and Wits have no choice but to release the player.&rdquo;Mumble confirmed that they had shortlisted five candidates for the Bafana Bafana coaching job. &ldquo;We will make an official announcement at the end of the month,&rdquo; he said. Meanwhile, Fifa president Gianni Infantino, who is in Mzansi for the Fifa summit, made his first official visit to Safa House yesterday. The 46-year-old said he was impressed by the state of SA football: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure for me to be here in Mzansi. &rdquo;
