THE mayors of local and district municipalities were on their way to address residents on Wednesday and the people were already in full song.But instead of singing praises, the angry residents were chanting &ldquo;Voetsek, siyazabalaza!&rdquo; While the mayors were still trying to address residents&rsquo; complaints, chaos erupted and the officials had to be escorted away for their own safety.Tempers had already flared when the mayors did not turn up for a meeting on Tuesday with residents of Itsoseng in Lichtenburg, North West.The two mayors finally arrived on Wednesday to address residents, but they were met by a hostile crowd.Daniel Buthelezi, the mayor of Ditsobotla Local Municipality, had a tough time getting proceedings under way as the angry community wanted to know why the MECs responsible for various departments were not also there.Buthelezi and Justice Makolomakwe, the mayor of Ngaka Modiri Molema District Municipality, were finally allowed to address the people, and afterwards the community had an opportunity to respond.But chaos erupted when people left towards the mayors.Residents said there had been countless meetings, marches and letters written to government asking for clean water for all areas, as well as a staffed police station, functioning healthcare and properly fixed sewerage systems and pothole repairs. When Buthelezi responded, the impatient crowd jeered, saying that he always only made promises.The two mayors were then quickly taken to their cars and left, escorted by bodyguards and police officers. Some people ran towards the main road, apparently in an attempt to prevent the officials from leaving.
