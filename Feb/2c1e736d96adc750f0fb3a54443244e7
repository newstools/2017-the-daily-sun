TWO Nelson Mandela Bay sergeants scooped the Visible Policing Team of the Year award. The award was at the National Excellence Awards held at the Sun City resort in Rustenburg, North West on Friday.Sergeants Severiano Blundin and Sphumelele Msindwana, members of the Port Elizabeth flying squad, are a two-man team that has been performing the same duties since 2015. Police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci said during this time they arrested 211 suspects for serious crimes, recovered 157 motor vehicles and seized 528kg of dagga and 43 101 mandrax tablets. She bragged about the cops&rsquo; integrity, saying they could not be bribed.Soci said the two spotted a suspicious looking vehicle while performing their duties in March. &ldquo;The driver refused to stop when asked to do so. The sergeants gave chase and managed to force the vehicle off the road. &ldquo;When they approached the vehicle, Sergeant Blundin noticed five cooler bags in the car. &ldquo;He searched the vehicle and the suspects offered the cops up to R150 000 if they let him go. &ldquo;The two refused the offer. When they opened the cooler bags they found bags containing 1 000 Mandrax tablets with a street value of R3,2 million.&rdquo;
