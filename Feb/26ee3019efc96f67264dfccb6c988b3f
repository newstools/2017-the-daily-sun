New Orlando Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret goes straight into battle when Bucs host Polokwane City in a Premiership encounter on Saturday afternoon.The match at the Orlando Stadium is set to kick off at 15H30.Jonevret was only announced as the Pirates coach on Monday morning, but a temporary work permit means he will take his seat on the technical bench in Soweto this weekend.With a Soweto derby showdown against Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs to come next, Jonevret has little option but to hit the ground running.The Swede inherits a side that have gone eight matches without a league win under caretaker boss August Palacios. The Sea Robbers did, however, show great endevour and spirit to come back from 2-1 down to grab a point away to high-flying Cape Town City in their most recent action."I've seen them play for a few games and there's a very talented group of players but little less of confidence I think," Jonevret said."To start with of course you have to go back to basics, and start a little bit all over. I'm not going to change everything, I'm going to sit down with the staff and the coaches and discuss what we can do better," he explained.While Pirates are 10th on the standings with 20 points, Polokwane are four positions and four points better off in sixth spot.&nbsp;The Limpopo side are, however, yet to win in 2017 after drawing all three of their matches since the league restarted.Their coach, Luc Eymael, knows his side needs to be wary of a Pirates contingent eager to impress their new boss."Coming into the game, yes the players [of Pirates] will try to show their skills in front of the new coach but I'm sure and I hope we will respond very well," Eymael told&nbsp;KickOff."We'll try to do the best we can to compete against Pirates despite the fact that they are a big team and they've a new coach.""You know my philosophy is not to play for a draw, we'll try to collect the three points. We know that it is very difficult but we'll try to do our best," he added.Goalkeeper Jackson Mabokgwane serves the second of a two game ban for Bucs, while Rise and Shine have no suspensions or injury issues.There have been no reports that winger Thabo Rakhale is back from injury, but for the most part, Jonevret should have a full strength squad available.The first round encounter ended in a 1-1 draw.
