SEX is a beautiful experience between two responsible people.Chomi, it is just as much your responsibility as it is ya bae to protect yourself. Birth control is not morally wrong as it gives you an opportunity to delay parenthood and enjoy it later when you are ready.Having a child as a teenager can place a lot of restrictions on your future by limiting your education which reduces job opportunities, and gives you a lower degree of independence. Chomi, this does not have to be you! Your answer lies in the double-up method = birth control + condoms. Using this method reduces your chances of unplanned pregnancy, HIV and STIs.IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW Respect your body and that of your partner, and do not be pressured Know your status!
