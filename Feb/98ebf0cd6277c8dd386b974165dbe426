EIGHT years ago, madala Phumzile Ntintili thought he was doing the right thing when he questioned possible corruption in his village.But instead he lost his job and is heartbroken every time he sees the building that caused his troubles.The 60-year-old year from Mnceba Village in Ntabankulu said in 2009, he worked as a foreman for a construction company hired by Ntabankulu Municipality to build a community hall in Dungu Village.He claimed he was suspended after he raised concern about the monthly salary of R3 300 being paid to a ghost worker. He said he worked for the construction company for three months and finding the alleged irregularity led to his suspension. He said he was told to wait for a call for his disciplinary hearing but it never came. Instead, the hall was completed while he was left with unanswered questions.&ldquo;I had faith that the municipality would investigate and deal with the project manager, but instead I lost my job without being told why. &ldquo;The municipal management of that time was informed of what was happening but I was left out while it seems people ate money.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Lixolile Petela said the construction the madala speaks of was completed in 2009 and the municipality would not reinstate anyone after construction was completed. He said Phumzile is damaging the municipality&rsquo;s reputation as he has been quiet all these years.&ldquo;I cannot confirm the allegations of a ghost worker but am aware of the project. It was completed and all the people who worked there were fully paid. If Phumzile was suspended, no way could he be reinstated after the project&rsquo;s completion, as all workers lost their jobs.&rdquo;
