Dear MizzBOften when I am making love with my man the condom breaks. We usually carry on without it. Would a female condom be a better option for us?- ConfusedDear ConfusedCondoms are very effective when used correctly. A lot of things can be responsible for breakage, such as incorrect wearing of the condom, using it beyond the expiry date and storing it in a warm place. The friction that happens during sex can weaken the condom but this can be prevented by applying lubrication. Female condoms are a great choice for protection and they&rsquo;re highly effective when used correctly.
