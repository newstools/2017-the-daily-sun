A GROUP of protestors, led by the SA Football Players Union (Safpu), took advantage of Fifa president Gianni Infantino&rsquo;s visit to Safa House to picket outside yesterday.Safpu leaders claim former Golden Arrows midfielder Clifton Miheso, a union member, was forced at gunpoint to sign a contract termination letter by the PSL club &ndash; and they want Fifa to be informed. This is Infantino&rsquo;s first visit to Mzansi since he was elected Fifa president last year. He took over from the disgraced Sepp Blatter, who was banned and expelled from world football&rsquo;s mother body. Safpu&rsquo;s claims that the picketing was a genuine call on Fifa to investigate Miheso&rsquo;s claims, as these were not taken seriously by the local soccer association. Safpu said in a statement last month: &ldquo;Players are denied their democratic right to belong to the trade union of their choice. We wrote to Safa, they never had the decency to acknowledge our letter and yet we are expected to regard them as the football authority in this country.&rdquo;Safa CEO Dennis Mumble responded to Safpu allegations yesterday: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not something I want to comment on because I do not really know what it is exactly. &ldquo;They have not asked us to do anything. You can&rsquo;t just go up to a person on the street, they must come and meet us. &ldquo;I am still waiting to receive something from Safpu regarding this issue. &ldquo;Ask them to show you a copy of the letter they sent us.&rdquo;
