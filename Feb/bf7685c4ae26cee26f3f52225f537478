MUSICIANS claim that events promoter Ben Moseme is not a man of his word.This comes after Ben cancelled the annual 80s Legends Extravaganza Concert, three days before the event.According to music legend William Mthethwa, the concert was scheduled for Boxing Day at the Phakisa race course in Welkom, Free State. William claimed Ben had told them that he was having problems with the local municipality and had made an undertaking to pay each of the booked artists &ndash; Condry Ziqubu, Om Alec Khaoli, Steve Kekana, Babsy Mlangeni, Blondie Makhene and William &ndash; R5 000 each as compensation.&ldquo;He apologised for the cancellation and said he&rsquo;d faced challenges with the local municipality. He told us that he could not pay us the full R15 000 amount but would give us R5 000 each by the end of January,&rdquo; said William.An angry Blondie said they are prepared to take legal action against Ben.Blondie said: &ldquo;This is the reason why artists die as paupers. This man has disrespected us and we are going to sue his a**!&rdquo;.After several attempts to reach Ben, he said he was busy on a conference call.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk now. I&rsquo;m on a conference call. I will only be available later,&rdquo; said Ben. Later, he was no longer picking up calls.
