THANDEKA Sithole was grabbed half-naked, videotaped and beaten up for allegedly sleeping with another woman&rsquo;s man. But the 20-year-old denies the allegation &ndash; and so does the man. Their denial did not stop Precious Mabuza from severely beating Thandeka with a stick in front of villagers at Langeloop, Mpumalanga. In the seven-minute video, which went viral on social media, Precious can be heard calling Thandeka names. Thandeka told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I told her I did not even know her boyfriend.&ldquo;I fled to the street, but she caught up with me and forced me to take off my skirt. She carried on beating me.&rdquo; In the video Thandeka is ordered to strip. Precious then stabs at her punani repeatedly with the stick. Thandeka said: &ldquo;I cannot sleep with the pain in my punani. I heard she is out of jail and I&rsquo;m angry. I will get her.&rdquo; Precious said she now feels bad about what she did, and she has since left the village. &ldquo;I am not proud of what I did, but she cheated with my man. I reacted badly, but I am not a bad woman.&rdquo;Tonga police spokesman Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said Precious had been arrested was released on bail on Monday.
