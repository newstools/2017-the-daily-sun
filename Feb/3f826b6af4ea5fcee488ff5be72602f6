Another source close to Bibo said although the star was banned from the field, Neo had become his source of strength. &ldquo;Two weeks ago, Bibo threw Neo a baby shower as sign of appreciation for how she stuck with him through his rough times and ban from the soccer fraternity. &ldquo;And that is not normal for him. He used to give Neo headaches. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d come home late and take midnight phone calls from different women.&rdquo; A third source alleged: &ldquo;When Pulane&rsquo;s naked pictures surfaced on social networks, Bibo told us he will never speak to her again because she had embarrassed him in front of the whole nation. &ldquo;But now he is busy giving her attention even though she wants nothing to do with him.&rdquo; When called for comment, Neo told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Hehehe, butle abuti,&rdquo; before she hung up. Bibo, Pulani and Katlego were not available for comment at the time of going to print as their phones rang unanswered.
