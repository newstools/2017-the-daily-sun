HOME Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba yesterday said most immigrants are not involved in crime. He was speaking at a church service in Sunnyside, Tshwane, after violence flared up between locals and foreigners in the capital on Friday. Gigaba said immigrants add value to South African society, as many of them are teachers, nurses, doctors, lecturers and engineers. Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura has condemned violence and intimidation against foreigners in Joburg and Tshwane. &ldquo;We cannot afford to see the killing of foreigners. Let us all stand up and say: not in our name.&rdquo; The issue also caught the attention of President Jacob Zuma, who said: &ldquo;We just cannot co-exist with crime and criminals, whether they are South Africans or foreigners. &ldquo;They must be harshly dealt with within the law.&rdquo; Meanwhile, in Sebokeng, in the Vaal, five armed men went on a rampage and broke into shops over the weekend. They shot one shopkeeper and hit another with a gun before making off with R10 000. Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said the victims told cops the men demanded money before telling them to go back to their own countries.They also told them to stop bringing drugs to the area. &ldquo;A case of business robbery has been opened but no arrests have been made yet,&rdquo; he said.On Friday, Gigaba held a meeting with 30 African Union ambassadors to discuss tensions between South Africans and foreigners. The meeting took place after residents of Pretoria West and surrounding areas protested against illegal immigrants. &ldquo;We expect the ambassadors will appeal to their nationals to respect the laws of the country in which they live,&rdquo; said Gigaba.
