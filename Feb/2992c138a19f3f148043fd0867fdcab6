TSHIDISO regrets taking his lover on holiday to spend some quality time together.That&rsquo;s because he is now all alone while his lover of eight years is in another man&rsquo;s arms. The SunTeam met up with Tshidiso Moloi (30) on Sunday, standing outside the entrance of Phiri Guest House in Tshwane.He was crying hysterically, surrounded by three backpacks and plastic bags filled with clothes.When he calmed down he said: &ldquo;I will never date a white woman again.&rdquo;He said that he took two weeks leave from work just so he could treat his woman to a special Valentine&rsquo;s Day. He said they arrived in Tshwane last Sunday from Brits, in the North West.&ldquo;I wanted to show her how much I loved her. I had never taken her out because she was always busy looking after our three children.&rdquo;&ldquo;Everything was fine between us until just now. We were in our booked room when we had an argument. It escalated and security threw us out.&rdquo; He said as soon as they were outside, they were approached by a mlungu carrying a knobkerrie.&ldquo;The man threatened to beat the hell out of me. I just stood there and watched as my girlfriend walked away with him.&rdquo; Tshidiso refused to say what they had argued about.He said what worries him is that he was the last person her family saw her with. Tshidiso said he will not report the incident to the cops. &ldquo;She left willingly. It was as if she had planned the fight because the man was already waiting for her outside the guesthouse.&rdquo; He said he wants nothing to do with her but he still has her ID, clothes and cellphone.
