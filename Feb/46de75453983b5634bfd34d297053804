LAST YEAR a tornado destroyed Ntshilibe Junior Secondary School. The parents took it upon themselves to raise funds to have the school, situated in Ndobe Village outside Port St John&rsquo;s, fixed. This followed several empty promises from the education department to have the school fixed. Now, a year later, another tornado has struck the school, leaving parents afraid that they might have to dig deep into their empty pockets again to raise money for repairs. The school was left with no roof and shattered windows when strong winds blew through the area late on Saturday afternoon.Principal Oscar Luzwathi and SGB chairman William Nkungu said after the previous incident, the parents, together with the school&rsquo;s SGB, had raised R30 000 to have the damage fixed.Luzwathi said: &ldquo;The department promised us temporary structures but nothing came of it.&rdquo; He added that they reported the matter to the provincial office in Bhisho.Malibongwe Mtima, the provincial education spokesman, said he will have to check on the department&rsquo;s system to see whether the problem had been reported.&ldquo;Normally inspectors are sent to the affected school to check the extent of the damage.&rdquo;
