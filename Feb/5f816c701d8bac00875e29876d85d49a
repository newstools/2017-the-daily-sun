BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt insists that their 2-0 league defeat to defending Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday won&rsquo;t affect their title aspirations. The defeat paved the way for SuperSport United to overtake them at the top of the table following a 1-0 win over relegation-haunted Highlands Park on the same day. Wits are a point behind United and Cape Town City on 34 points.However, Hunt is concerned because his side will be playing a lot of matches in a short period due to their involvement in the Champions League, where they will face Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the first round, first leg at the Al-Salam Stadium in Cairo on 11 March.Said Hunt: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk about title aspirations now. We have played only 17 games and still have another 13 to go. If it was five games to go, then certainly. There is lot of football still to play. &ldquo;As you know we&rsquo;ve got to play a midweek game before a Champions League game, which is something we never did last year. So that&rsquo;s also going to be very difficult for us.&rdquo;Hunt was disappointed that his players failed to utilise the chances they created, which caused them to drop points.Said Hunt: &ldquo;I was just disappointed. We didn&rsquo;t deserve to lose. Sundowns scored two goals from free kicks, one of them in injury time. We were pressing, trying to win the game but our final ball wasn&rsquo;t good enough. We were very unfortunate.&rdquo;Hunt also criticised the Loftus pitch, saying it affected their game plan. He is positive they will overcome the setback and recharge their energy levels ahead of their next league clash with Bloemfontein Celtic at Bidvest Stadium on Friday (8pm).
