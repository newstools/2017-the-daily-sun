HE was beaten, kidnapped and left for dead.But Dionisio Bilo (47), a security guard at a workshop in Meyerton, Midvaal in Gauteng, survived.&ldquo;I was working night shift on Saturday when four men tried to break into the workshop. &ldquo;I went after them but they ran away,&rdquo; he said.Bilo said he called his mlungu boss, who said he would send his wife to the factory because he was on holiday.But then the boss&rsquo;s three sons arrived.&ldquo;They asked me questions because they did not know who I was.&rdquo;When the wife arrived she confirmed Bilo&rsquo;s identity and left at the same time as the cops. &ldquo;The sons said I must identify the robbers, but I told them I didn&rsquo;t know them,&rdquo; said Bilo.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when they started beating me with wooden poles and telling me they were going to kill me.&rdquo;Then they allegedly blindfolded him, took his cellphone and money and drove him to the Free State.&ldquo;They left me in the bushes. I was in pain and bleeding.&rdquo;They drove away but came back immediately.&ldquo;I heard them saying, let&rsquo;s find him and finish him off.&rdquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t find him and left. Bloody, dirty and in pain, he walked 70km through the night and got to his home in Meyerton the next day.Amos Msimanga (53) who alerted Daily Sun to Bilo&rsquo;s ordeal, said the same men called him names when he was walking with Bilo close to the factory.&ldquo;They told me they do not want to see me because I am a crook,&rdquo; he said.Constable Maria Letsele, a police spokeswoman, said that cases of assault, kidnapping and common robbery were opened at the Meyerton cop shop.&ldquo;Two suspects were arrested and appeared on Friday in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court and again on Monday for a bail application.&rdquo; She did not know what the outcome was.
