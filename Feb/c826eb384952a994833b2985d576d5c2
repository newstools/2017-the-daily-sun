ROGER de Sa says he won&rsquo;t be changing much when Maritzburg United get back to Absa Premiership action on Wednesday. The former Ajax Cape Town coach said the Davids brothers, Fadlu and Maahier, did an amazing job in charge of the club after the departure of Ernst Middendorp last November. De Sa will make his debut as the Team of Choice head coach when they face Polokwane City in their Premiership clash at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm). He said in this match he would be banking on the good away run that United had in the first round of the league matches. Said De Sa: &ldquo;Fadlu and Maahier have done well in the couple of months they were in charge. I really don&rsquo;t have much to change &ndash; in fact, there is nothing to change. The players are committed and ready to go again. &ldquo;The away run speaks volumes and that is what I will be banking on when we play on Wednesday. I realise that Polokwane beat us at home in the first round but this time things will be different.&rdquo;The Team of Choice accumulated more points away than at home in their first 15 matches. They played seven games away and managed to get 11 points. At home they played eight matches and collected eight points. Against Rise and Shine, De Sa will have to try and get maximum points without his skipper, Kurt Lentjies, who will be serving his first of a two-match suspension. He was shown a red card in the last match of the first round against Bidvest Wits. De Sa also said he was looking forward to playing KwaZulu-Natal neighbours Golden Arrows away in the first round of the Nedbank Cup next month. &ldquo;I was hoping for a home draw but it&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m sure this derby will be as good as the others I&rsquo;ve been involved in before.&rdquo;
