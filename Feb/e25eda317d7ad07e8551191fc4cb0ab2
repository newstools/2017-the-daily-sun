POLOKWANE City coach Luc Eymael has lauded his players&rsquo; fighting spirit. City managed to steal a last-minute goal to grab a point in their 1-1 Absa Premiership draw with Highlands Park in Tembisa on Sunday. The Belgian mentor said the halftime talk helped his charges draw strength and put in the work until the dying minutes of the game. Said Eymael: &ldquo;At half-time I asked my players if they thought those boys were better than them. They said no. I asked if we could play better football than them, they said yes. &ldquo;I told them they had to go back onto the field with big hearts because we had to fight until the end if we wanted to leave with points. &ldquo;They did it well. It means I transferred the fighting spirit to my players but I can&rsquo;t play for them &ndash; my career is finished. I am happy the players showed fighting spirit.&rdquo;Although Eymael pushed his players on the field, he said he wasn&rsquo;t part of the scuffle that erupted between the two benches after the match. Tensions were high between the two teams after the game and it almost came to blows. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why because I didn&rsquo;t say a thing to Highlands Park. I went there to celebrate but certainly not to intentionally provoke them. I am not that kind of coach, I am a fair play coach. I said &lsquo;I am sorry&rsquo; to them because I was not being provocative.&ldquo;It (the celebration) was not directed at them, it was directed at my players. I knew it was the last minute of additional time (when we scored), I did it out of happiness,&rdquo; said Eymael. He said he was disappointed with how they conceded their goal. They had studied their opponents and should have been more wary of Highlands. &ldquo;We deserved the draw. I studied the team and when you study a team and concede such a goal, you have to be disappointed because your players are not doing what you asked,&rdquo; he said.
