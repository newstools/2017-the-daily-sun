HEAVY rain all over KZN since last week might have claimed the life of a 40-year-old man.This comes after the discovery of a decomposed body of an unknown man in the Tugela River in Mandeni, northern KZN. A police source told Daily Sun that a group of men who were fishing in the river on Wednesday notified them about the body they saw floating in the water near the Ehlanzeni area. &ldquo;It was not clear where and when he had drowned but we assume that it might have happened a few days ago when the northern part of the province experienced heavy rain.&rdquo; He said residents who live on either side of the river cross it each time they leave or return to their homes. He said cops suspect that the increase in the water level of the river might have led to the man drowning. Captain Nqobile Gwala, a KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed the incident. &ldquo;Cops were called to the scene where the body of an unknown man was seen. &ldquo;Upon arrival they noticed that the body had no arms and the right leg was also missing. &ldquo;An inquest docket was opened at Sundumbili cop shop for investigation.&rdquo; She urged families missing people of the same age who have disappeared in the past few days to come forward so that they can check if the body that was found belonged to any of them. Families with missing relatives can contact Sundumbili Police Station on 032 454 7830/32/33 to make arrangements to identify the body.
