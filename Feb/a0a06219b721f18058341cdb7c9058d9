THE 36-year-old mum was moving her 12-year-old son to another school and asked for his transfer card.She got the card but she wasn&rsquo;t prepared for the comments on it. The card issued by the school in the Vaal said her son was raped in 2013, was HIV-positive, and that he was diabetic and epileptic.The shocked mother from De Deur took her son to the clinic where test results showed he was not HIV-positive.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they have their own proof or what, but I took my son for tests and the results say he is healthy.&rdquo;The mum said she approached the school to get an explanation but she didn&rsquo;t have any success.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking this up with the department. This is an insult and it has traumatised me.&rdquo;She said although she managed to send her child to a new school, she didn&rsquo;t know how would this affect her son in the future.Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said this was a very serious allegation and they wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take disciplinary action against the principal.&ldquo;We would like to apologise unconditionally to the pupil and his parents for the statement made by the school.&rdquo; Bodibe added that district officials will visit the school to investigate the matter and asked the parent to present the evidence.
