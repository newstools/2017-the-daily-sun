Dear MizzBI am a 23-year-old woman.My father abandoned me before I was born. I want to improve my life but I do not have any support. What can I do?- Needing HelpDear Needing HelpIt is important that you know that the decision your father made to abandon you is not your fault.He is the one who chose not to be a part of your life.Do not blame yourself for his actions.A real man stands by his choices and accepts the responsibilities that accompany the decisions he makes.There are plenty of opportunities available to you. What are you interested in?Lots of organisations, retail shops and private companies offer learnership programmes.Go out there, knock on doors and ask for information.Make sure you only approach legitimate businesses, as the companies you work for will be your future references.
