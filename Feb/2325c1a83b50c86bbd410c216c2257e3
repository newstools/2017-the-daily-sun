THE Independent Electoral Commission has not decided when elections will be held to elect new leaders for Nquthu Municipality.The commission is still waiting to meet co-operative governance MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube about her decision to dissolve the council. IEC spokesman Mawethu Mosery said the commission is aware of the MEC&rsquo;s decision, but is still waiting to meet her.He said: &ldquo;The commission cannot make any decisions at this stage because we are yet to meet the MEC. We want her to officially tell us about her decision regarding the council.&rdquo;On Monday, Dube-Ncube announced that the Nquthu council has been dissolved and said elections will take place to vote in new leaders.Dube-Ncube said since she placed the municipality under administration last year, there have been seven attempts to elect municipal leaders.&ldquo;This is the only municipality in the country that has no mayor, speaker or executive committee,&rdquo; said the MEC.Her decision was criticised by the Inkatha Freedom Party, which obtained a majority in the council during last year&rsquo;s local government election. The IFP claimed that Dube-Ncube&rsquo;s decision was motivated by the fact that the ANC did not win the municipality.IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala said the party is still going to meet to discuss Dube-Ncube&rsquo;s decision.&ldquo;We will then be able to comment on the matter.&rdquo; ANC provincial secretary Super Zuma said they suggested the council be dissolved a long time ago.&ldquo;We suggested this after the election results were announced. &ldquo;We were not satisfied at all. &ldquo;When the IFP accused Dube-Ncube of being jealous because the ANC didn&rsquo;t win the election, we simply took their accusations as cheap political tactics.&rdquo;
