SOUTH AFRICA will introduce a national minimum wage of &nbsp;R3 500 a month in 2018. This was said by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday. It happened after long negotiations between government and labour unions. Supporters of a minimum wage say it can stimulate growth as workers can spend more and also reduce inequality.Critics say it could lead to increased unemployment as employers will be unable to afford higher wage bills. Credit ratings agencies have said agreeing on a minimum wage would help Africa&rsquo;s most industrialised economy hold onto its investment-grade rating by stabilising the labour market and reducing the number of strikes.&ldquo;The balance we have sought to strike is that it must not be too low, so it does not affect the lowest-paid workers, but not so high that it leads to massive job losses,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said. He added that the national minimum wage &ndash; equating to R20 an hour &ndash; would come into effect in May 2018. &ndash; REUTERS.
