HE IS funny on stage &ndash; but what he allegedly did at a wedding ceremony was no laughing matter!Comedian Felix Hlophe is accused of acting like a diva last weekend at the Durban wedding of Dr Sifiso Makhanya. Sources allege that Felix, who was the MC, rushed off to another gig.The groom&rsquo;s brother Ayanda Mdluli said: &ldquo;I know the guy is a comedian. But he wasn&rsquo;t funny at my brother&rsquo;s wedding, he was annoying. He hasn&rsquo;t come back to us to explain or apologise. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want him to return the money. But we want him to know that he must never do to other people what he did to us, because they&rsquo;d teach him a lesson,&rdquo; said Ayanda.Another source said: &ldquo;Zuluboy is a good friend of the family. So he agreed to act as MC without getting paid.&rdquo; Zuluboy confirmed that he took over as MC after Felix left the reception.Felix blamed Dr Makhanya for arriving two hours late &ndash; at 5pm. &ldquo;I told him I had another gig and he told me to f**k off. He sent friends to threaten me. I then left,&rdquo; said Felix.But he told Sunday Sun he couldn&rsquo;t make it to the next gig in time. &ldquo;I was running late and had to ask one of my friends to stand in for me,&rdquo; said Felix.
