A FRIENDSHIP that lasted for almost five years has come to a tragic end. Siyanda Ngcobo (26) was stabbed on Sunday at a tavern in Cabazini Village, Greytown in the KZN Midlands.Siyanda is nursing his wounds at home after spending a day in Greytown Hospital.He sustained serious injuries to his face, head and chest in the incident.Now Siyanda feels his friend was jealous and wanted to rearrange his face.&ldquo;These scars will stay with me forever and no woman will want me. I&rsquo;ve known her for about five years but we&rsquo;ve never had such a fight,&rdquo; said Siyanda. He told Daily Sun that demanding his cellphone back was the main reason that he was attacked.&ldquo;We used to spend a lot of time together at Lubi&rsquo;s Shebeen and she would borrow my cellphone as she loved playing games on it. &ldquo;But on 25 January, she took it and never gave it back. I forgot to ask for it as well. The following day when I told her to bring it back, she denied having it,&rdquo; said Siyanda.He said the days went by as she began avoiding his calls until they met again at their boozing spot on Sunday. Then a quarrel broke out following another confrontation. &ldquo;She was having a beer when I approached her. When I asked her where my phone was, she broke a bottle and started stabbing me.&rdquo; He claimed that if he had not been rescued by other patrons, he would be dead.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting whatever we had in the past behind me. I want her to rot in jail for nearly killing me for a phone. I now realise she was never a good person, just a thief who laughed with me, pretending to be a good friend.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened at Greytown cop shop after the suspect attacked a 26-year-old man at a local shebeen. &ldquo;No arrest has been made at this stage,&rdquo; said Zwane.
