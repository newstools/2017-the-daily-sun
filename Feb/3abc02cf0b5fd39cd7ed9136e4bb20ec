VUYO MADOLO was a very active young boy who loved to imitate bigger kids.After a cousin got a tongue piercing last month, four-year-old Vuyo cried and told his mum he wanted one too.His mum, Elizabeth Shabangu (32), repeatedly told him that he needed to be older before he could pierce his tongue. And, she pointed out, the tongue ring was in most cases meant for girls, not boys.But young Vuyo from Etwatwa East in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, was not convinced. He kept asking for a tongue ring.&ldquo;He was just a child and I thought he was playing around and would outgrow it,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.&ldquo;We are shocked by what happened to him.&rdquo; On Thursday, Vuyo was crying, with chest pain and was coughing up blood.His dad, Ishmael Madolo (34) said: &ldquo;We rushed him to the Far East Hospital in Springs.&rdquo; An X-ray showed an earring caught in his chest. The child had swallowed it as he was trying to put it on his tongue.&ldquo;They gave him some medication and made another appointment but the date was a bit far. &ldquo;We decided to take him to Joburg Hospital, where an operation was arranged for Monday.&rdquo; But Monday was too late. &ldquo;My child died on Friday, in pain,&rdquo; Ishmael said.
