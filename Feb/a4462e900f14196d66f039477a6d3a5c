LIVING with a disability is no longer supposed to be an obstacle to anything &ndash; especially love!That is what Salome Sizani (36) has decided.Eight years ago she fell head over heals in love with Victor Thamande (40), who is physically disabled. The two met at a park and, they say, it was love at first sight.Ever since then, the couple from Mamelodi in Tshwane have been inseparable.So for them getting married was the only thing left to do.But Salome&rsquo;s family, especially her brother, Timothy Sizani, are having none of it. He is refusing to accept Victor&rsquo;s lobola because of his disability. As a result of this, Salome is spitting fire. She said: &ldquo;He is my soulmate and no one is going to stop me from spending the rest of my life with him.&ldquo;When I introduced him to my family it was not because I wanted them to make a mockery of him.&ldquo;I just wanted them to accept him the same way I have.&rdquo; According to Victor, Timothy allegedly insulted him. &ldquo;He told me that I won&rsquo;t be able to take care of his sister because of my disability.&rdquo;Victor said he wants to do things the right way but it is getting harder for him to tolerate the disrespectful Timothy.&ldquo;I have become a laughing stock in my area because of his insults.&ldquo;I know my grant money is not enough, but for the past five years I have been taking care of her with that as well as with piece jobs that I get.&rdquo;Salome said if her brother continues to cause trouble they will get married at Home Affairs. When Daily Sun contacted Timothy, he said he was not against his sister getting married, but he was worried about the person she would be marrying.&ldquo;All I want is for her to be happy and to be with a man who will be able to take care of her. I do not want her to struggle financially,&rdquo; he said.
