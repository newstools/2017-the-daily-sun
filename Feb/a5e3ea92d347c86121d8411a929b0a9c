RESIDENTS of Phiphidi outside Thohoyandou are reeling in shock following Mashudu Masiagwala&rsquo;s murder.Mashudu (62) was shot and killed outside his house by unknown attackers on Tuesday night.His family said he had left the house to go to an outside toilet when he was shot.They believe his murder was planned but they&rsquo;re not sure who is behind it.This brings to three the number of family members who have died in the space of three months.Three weeks ago, family member Johannes Masiagwala died and in November the family buried Ntondeni Masiagwala. The latest incident has shocked the peaceful village.Neighbours said they heard four gunshots and a scream before a vehicle sped off. Mashudu&rsquo;s daughter Suzan Masiagwala said the family was watching TV when her father went outside. &ldquo;Soon afterwards, we heard gunshots and a scream followed by a vehicle speeding away.&ldquo;We phoned neighbours who told us the shots were from our yard. &ldquo;We were scared to go out and only this morning did we realise my father had been killed,&rdquo; said Suzan. Mashudu&rsquo;s son Avhazwifuni Masiagwala said the family was in shock. &ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know what happened but strongly believe our father&rsquo;s death was a well organised hit. &ldquo;Our father did not have enemies. Or if he did, we didn&rsquo;t know about them.&rdquo; Avhazwifuni said his father worked far away and only came home on Fridays. &ldquo;It surprises us how his attackers knew he was home. And how did they know about the movements which led to his killing?&rdquo;Captain Takalani Malogwa confirmed the incident. &ldquo;A murder case has been opened but no one has been arrested. We appeal to anyone with information to go to the nearest police station.&rdquo;
