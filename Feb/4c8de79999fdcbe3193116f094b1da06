She doesn&rsquo;t respect her brand &ndash; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Thato.Touch Central station manager, Martin Vilakazi, said: &ldquo;I told those guys to call me or text me if they want to enquire about one of our presenters. I don&rsquo;t know why they came to you guys. Sammy is doing a great job here. They just want to ruin her image.&rdquo;Sammy Sosa refused to comment and hung up the phone.
