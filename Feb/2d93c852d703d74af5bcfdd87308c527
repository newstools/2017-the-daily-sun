PROTESTORS blocked several streets in Atteridgeville this morning, preventing residents from going to work, Gauteng cops said.They also threw rocks and burned tyres, said spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini."We are not yet sure why they are protesting. We are not sure whether it's about the [anti-immigrant] march," he said.He could also not give an estimate of how many people were taking part in the protest at this stage but said police were monitoring the situation.The police were also investigating reports of a newspaper truck that was looted.Tshwane metro police spokesman Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they had received reports of several shops being looted, but had yet to confirm the incidents.Morning Live anchor Leanne Manas tweeted that a news camera and other equipment had been "confiscated" by protesters in Atteridgeville.She later tweeted that the news crew managed to negotiate with protesters to get the equipment back."#Atteridgeville protestors say media portray them in a negative light &amp; call it #xenophobia when all they want is to get rid of criminals," she tweeted.On Saturday, residents of Pretoria West raided homes they alleged were being used as brothels and drug dens. They called for "pimps" to release prostitutes. Two houses were set alight.On 11 February, at least 10 houses allegedly being used for drug dealing and prostitution were set alight in Rosettenville, Johannesburg.
