THE people are angry and they showed it by setting fire to the mayor&rsquo;s car.&nbsp; Bela-Bela in Limpopo was covered in smoke as mayor Jeremiah Ngobeni&rsquo;s personal VW Polo was burnt, and a building and tyres were set alight yesterday. Residents are accusing the municipality of increasing rates by R466 for what is called an electricity fee, without consulting the people, and also for withholding a corruption report. The mayor was driving to the protest when his car was attacked. He ran to a police Nyala after his car was petrol bombed. A resident said: &ldquo;Before we protested we spoke to the municipality and they told us the rates fee will be reduced in June, but we can&rsquo;t wait until then.&rdquo; Another resident said they want the municipality to release an audit report into alleged corruption and maladministration at the municipality. &ldquo;They obviously don&rsquo;t want us to know what&rsquo;s going on in the municipality. We won&rsquo;t rest until we get that report and this unreasonable fee is scrapped.&rdquo; Daily Sun contacted Ngobeni who said he was going to a meeting and we should call back. His phone was off later. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the police arrested several people for public violence after a building was torched and the mayor&rsquo;s car was set alight. &ldquo;We had to use rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. It is not clear if anyone from the community got injured but two cops were slightly hurt by stones,&rdquo; he said.
