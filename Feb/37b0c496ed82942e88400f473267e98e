GOGO Tinyiko Ndlovu (63) could not believe her eyes when she found half a loaf of bread buried in her yard on Monday.&ldquo;I was removing weeds from the yard when I noticed a small hole in the ground covered in sand,&rdquo; said the gogo from Makuleke Village in Malamulele, Limpopo.&ldquo;At first I was scared, but I eventually opened the hole to see what was inside it.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s when she discovered the bread.&ldquo;I suspect someone is trying to kill me with muthi,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who and why any person would try to do such evil to me, because as far as I am concerned, I do not owe anyone in the village anything.&rdquo; Asked what she did with the bread, she said: &ldquo;I peed on the bread to destroy the evil, then I put it in a plastic bag and threw it away in the bush.&rdquo; Tinyiko said she believed urine could kill any muthi meant to destroy anybody.The gogo lives alone as her five kids work in Joburg. Traditional healer N&rsquo;wa-Xithlangoma Chauke said: &ldquo;The person who buried the bread in gogo&rsquo;s yard wanted to kill her.&rdquo;Chauke advised the gogo to consult a powerful inyanga to help her stop the evil person from proceeding with the plan.
