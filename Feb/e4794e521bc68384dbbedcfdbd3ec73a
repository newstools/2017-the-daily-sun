IT WAS late on Friday night when Portia Makuto (39) and her boyfriend had a big argument.&nbsp; And when Portia couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, she decided to go to bed in their shack in Mandela Section, near Westonaria, Gauteng.&nbsp; But the next morning she woke up to a big surprise.&nbsp; Portia said she found that her live-in-lover, Siyabonga Mashao (48), was gone and so were the groceries they had bought!&nbsp; Portia called the neighbours and they walked down the street, following a trail of rice lying on the street.&nbsp; They thought the rice might lead them to the boyfriend and they were right.&nbsp; They found Siyabonga sleeping in a shack by himself.&nbsp; Portia told Daily Sun: &ldquo;On Friday night he accused me of cheating.&nbsp; &ldquo;I just went to bed because I was tired of fighting.&nbsp; &ldquo;He just left, but I never thought he would take the groceries. When we found him in the shack I asked him why he had taken the groceries because both of us paid for food.&rdquo;&nbsp; Siyabonga said: &ldquo;I was wrong to take the groceries. I took them because I was angry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I paid R500 for the groceries. I suspected Portia had a new lover because she would stay out for a long time even when I called her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The community helped the couple make peace.&nbsp; Community leader Mjuli Skholiwe told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Our aim was to make peace between the two. It&rsquo;s good when these issues are resolved without fighting.&rdquo;&nbsp;
