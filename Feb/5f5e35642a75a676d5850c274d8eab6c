ORLANDO Pirates&rsquo; new head coach Kjell Jonevret is bracing himself for Saturday&rsquo;s Absa Premiership derby against arch-enemies Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium.The Swedish-born coach joined Bucs last week and oversaw last weekend&rsquo;s 1-1 draw against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium, but can expect a much tougher battle against high-riding Amakhosi, who have turned the corner after a rocky start to the season.Bucs, on the other hand, are rocking from one crisis to the next. This culminated in chairman Irvin Khoza appointing Jonevret, who is not well known as a coach outside of Sweden and Norway.Jonevret had only been given the green light from Home Affairs to work last Wednesday and that did not give the new mentor enough time to work with and get to know his players ahead of their clash with City.With the derby looming Jonevret said: &ldquo;I would have liked to have gone into the derby on the back of a win. We made mistakes against City. At least I will have a week to work with them before the derby.&rdquo;Jonevret said he thought Pirates played &ldquo;pretty good football&rdquo; against Rise and Shine but understands the task before him. He realises he has plenty of work ahead if he is to restore Bucs&rsquo; pride after a shocking season, where the defence had conceded 12 goals in two league matches (6-1 against SuperSport United and 6-0 against Mamelodi Sundowns).Said Jonevret: &ldquo;We missed chances to score, especially in the second half, where we created enough chances to have collected the three points. But I think it will be easier for me this week. &ldquo;I will have more time with the players to be able to analyse the game and work on mistakes.&rdquo;Jonevret&rsquo;s main priority will be to get the confidence back &ndash; especially for leading goal-scorer Tendai Ndoro, who still leads the goal-scoring charts with 11 league goals despite not finding the back of the net since the brace he scored in the 2-2 draw with Highlands Park on 3 December.
