Orlando Pirates caretaker coach Augusto Palacios feels the Premiership side are fit and ready for the second half of the Premiership campaign.The Buccaneers ended the first-half of the season languishing in 10th place, but, with two games in hand, they have an opportunity to climb as high as fifth if they can win both.With this in mind, Palacios feels the preparation during the break will hold the Soweto giants in good stead as they target a solid start after the break.Their most recent friendly fixtures against Black Leopards saw the Sea Robbers run out 4-0 winners with Thamsanqa Gabuza grabbing a brace and midfielders Mpho Makola and Riyad Norodien adding gloss to the scoreline.Palacios led his side out for a second 90 minutes against the same opposition, with a different starting XI, but getting a similar result, this time winning 5-0.Tendai Ndoro's continued his impressive form which sees him lead the top scorers charts, with a treble - while attacking midfield duo Bernard Morrison and Gift Motupa both chipped in with solitary strikes."It's not about the number of goals but rather the physical condition and the attitude of the players that we are interested in," he told the club's website."All the players are focused and you can see it during training and when playing, we are very happy about this."
