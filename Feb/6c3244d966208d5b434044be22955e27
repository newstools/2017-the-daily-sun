THEY came armed with hammers, pangas and sjamboks to evict the Mpanza family from their home.They even climbed onto the roof and ripped off the metal sheets. And when Sibusiso Mpanza saw the state of his family&rsquo;s house in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni last Thursday, he collapsed from shock!Now his family is demanding police take action against the 16 young men.The Mpanza family told Daily Sun the woman who allegedly sold the house without their knowledge is now facing criminal charges after they opened cases of fraud and malicious damage to property.In the meantime, Sibusiso and his siblings are homeless.However, community members have vowed they will not allow the people who have bought the house to occupy it. &ldquo;I came home to find the house had no doors or windows. &ldquo;Residents couldn&rsquo;t do anything because the men were armed with dangerous weapons,&rdquo; said Sibusiso. He said when they asked the men to see their title deed, they produced fake papers.&ldquo;Their papers were signed in 2015, but our mum died in 2008. My mum didn&rsquo;t come out of the grave to sign the papers and sell the house!&rdquo; He said community members told him police had been at the scene when it all happened, but that they allegedly did nothing to save the house.Community member Jabulani Nhlane (36) said police should have protected the property. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said police were investigating cases of malicious damage to property and fraud. No arrests have been made yet.
