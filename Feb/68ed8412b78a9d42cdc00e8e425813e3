Resident Loyiso Mbalula (25) said: &ldquo;We live like pigs because our area is filthy.&ldquo;The municipality hasn&rsquo;t been collecting rubbish since December last year.&ldquo;We were told that a group of women who used to clean our area were stopped by the municipality. The women were doing an excellent job. &ldquo;But today we are forced to close our doors and windows because the whole area smells terrible.&ldquo;Some residents dump used nappies as well as dead dogs and cats.&rdquo; ANC ward chairman Khantolo Mataka blamed the DA municipality for the mess.Mataka said: &ldquo;The DA ended the contract of the women who used to clean the area. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t even inform us when they took that decision.&ldquo;But we have reported the matter to the councillor.&rdquo;Councillor Bongo Nombiba told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The termination of the contract affects the whole area negatively. &ldquo;The DA failed to explain why they terminated the contract.&ldquo;Now the whole community is suffering because there&rsquo;s rubbish all over the place.&rdquo;Mthubanzi Mniki, spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, said: &ldquo;Deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani, who is also the chairman of public health, said he will follow up the matter.&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not acceptable for people to live with uncollected rubbish.
