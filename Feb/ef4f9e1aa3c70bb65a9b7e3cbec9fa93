THE leaked Public Protector&rsquo;s report is not final and it will probably change, but the ANC Youth League doesn&rsquo;t want to wait.A huge crowd of league supporters matched to Absa headquarters in the Joburg CBD where they handed over a memorandum to officials at the bank.The march &ndash; organised by the league and ANC Women&rsquo;s League &ndash; follows a leaked preliminary Public Protector&rsquo;s report into apartheid debt.The report found the bank may need to repay a R2,2 billion bailout to the government of the time. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has emphasised the leaked report is not final and could still change dramatically.ANCYL Gauteng chairman Matome Chiloane said: &ldquo;If Absa doesn&rsquo;t pay back the money in 21 days, the youth league will occupy all their branches.&ldquo;We are giving them some time to pay back the money they stole many years ago.&rdquo; Chiloane said the march was attended by at least 25 000 people.Youth League president Collen Maine said members are willing to die for economic freedom and President Jacob Zuma must remove ministers who get in their way, calling them unpatriotic traitors.&ldquo;We are demanding the board and management of Absa pay back the money received from the South African Reserve Bank. &ldquo;The bank should do the honest thing, like their loyal clients who pay the loans without the bank taking them to debt collectors. The loan must be paid in full and with interest,&rdquo; said Maine, adding that bank representatives acknowledged receiving the memorandum and said the bank will reply to the league soon.
