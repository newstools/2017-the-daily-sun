GOGO Mafavuke Masinga (95) hated candlelight. She said it hurt her eyes and disturbed her sleep.But she was found burnt to death in her shack in Zamazama Village in Umhlabuyalingana, northern KZN on Sunday.Villagers said she may have forgotten to put out her candle, but her grieving granddaughter, Agnes Skombo (42), suspects foul play.&ldquo;Gogo had no electricity, so it wasn&rsquo;t an electrical fault. She never lit candles.&rdquo; Agnes said she last saw the gogo alive on Saturday evening when she bathed her and put her to bed.&ldquo;I live in the neighbourhood. &ldquo;I often came to her shack to take care of her. I was the only close living relative she had. &ldquo;When I left her shack, she was already in bed.&rdquo; Agnes said she was woken up by a neighbour&rsquo;s calls at about 2am, telling her the gogo&rsquo;s shack was on fire. &ldquo;When I got there, she was already dead. &ldquo;We pulled her lifeless body out of the shack and waited for the cops.&rdquo;KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said an inquest docket was opened at Emanguzi Police Station.&ldquo;The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated. &ldquo;No foul play is suspected at this stage and we are waiting for the post mortem results before we can comment further.&rdquo;
