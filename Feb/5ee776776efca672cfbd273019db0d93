THERE WAS no trace of his dead mum for almost a month.&nbsp; But then, according to residents, his guilty conscience forced him to lead cops to a shallow grave under the floor of his house.&nbsp; HE KEPT SAYING HE WAS SORRY HE KILLED HIS MOTHER, SAID A NEIGHBOUR. Nobody can explain why the 46-year-old son would kill his 72-year-old mother.The gogo who lived in Migson Manor, south of Joburg, went to take care of her son in Fine Town.Cecilia Mkahejane (44), a neighbour from Fine Town, said she last saw the gogo on 20 January when the gogo sent her to the shop to buy chips.&ldquo;When I didn&rsquo;t see her again I wondered what may have happened to her, but thought she may have gone back to her own place in Maxima,&rdquo; she said.But on Friday the relatives started asking questions.A family spokeswoman said she called her aunt on Friday, but her cellphone went straight to voicemail.&ldquo;I told other family members we needed to check on her,&rdquo; said the relative.She said they even went to Orange Farm Police Station, which sent them to a local mortuary where there was body of an elderly woman. &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t her,&rdquo; she said.They went to the son&rsquo;s house on Saturday.&ldquo;We asked him where gogo was and at first he tried to lie. He said she was taken to Bloemfontein by another relative named Thabo.&rdquo;But the family does not have a relative named Thabo. That raised the alarm and they started looking around the house. &ldquo;We asked him about a spot in the house which had soil and a carpet and that is when he confessed,&rdquo; claimed the relative.They removed the carpet and saw the grave. &ldquo;This has broken our hearts,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Who in their right mind would kill their own parents, bury them under the floor and sleep in the same house?&rdquo; Neighbours told Daily Sun they were shocked when the 46-year-old son confessed to killing his mother and then allegedly burying her before putting a mat and a sofa over the grave.&ldquo;He kept saying he was sorry he killed her,&rdquo; one resident said.The cops were called and on Sunday morning the gogo&rsquo;s remains were exhumed as neighbours gathered in the street outside the house.Police spokesman, Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng confirmed a case of murder was opened.&ldquo;The suspect was arrested at the scene and charged with murder,&rdquo; said the cop. He will be appearing in court soon.
