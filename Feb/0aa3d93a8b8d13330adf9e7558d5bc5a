A VIOLENT showdown is brewing between two ANC groups. One group, led by the North West Business Forum, plans to march to the provincial legislature in Mahikeng, North West today to physically remove Premier Supra Mahumapelo from office.But the ANC Youth League in the Ngaka Modiri Molema district will march to the same venue to protect him. The Business Forum accuses Mahumapelo of allowing corruption and mismanagement in his administration, while the youth league supports his decision not to give tenders to members of the forum. Sello Mogodiri, secretary of the forum, said they are not backing down even though the youth league also plans to march. The ANC in North West defended Mahumapelo, saying the forum consists of disgruntled ANC members who are not getting tenders from government. Provincial secretary Dakota Legoete said the business leaders failed to prove allegations against Mahumapelo.
