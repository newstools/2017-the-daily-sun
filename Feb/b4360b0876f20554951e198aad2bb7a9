Now we&rsquo;re waiting for the PSL with a date of the sitting. For now, I can&rsquo;t really reveal details of the case,&rdquo; said Mtimani.Eagles&rsquo; general manager Richard Makhoba said: &ldquo;This is a contractual matter between the club and the player. The club can&rsquo;t discuss such matters in the media. We hope to sort this before the DRC,&rdquo; said Makhoba.
