A LECTURER at Coastal KZN TVET College&rsquo;s Umlazi campus faces disciplinary action for allegedly refusing to teach a gay student.Bheka Khanyile (20) said being gay apparently got him on the wrong side of one of his lecturers. The second year office administration student claimed the lecturer made fun of him in front of everyone on Monday. &ldquo;She asked me if I was born with a 4-5 or a punani and everyone laughed.&rdquo; &ldquo;She told girls to seduce me and see if my 4-5 would get an erection. But the students didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;He said at first he cried, but then he reported her to the college management and the South African Students Organisation (Sasco). He said Sasco visited the campus on Tuesday and spoke with management, who instructed him to forgive the lecturer. Bheka&rsquo;s mother, Nomthandazo Shezi (44) said: &ldquo;She made fun of my son and must pay for that. I&rsquo;ve accepted him for being gay.&rdquo; Sibongiseni Khumalo, the Durban Gay and Lesbian Society Centre project co-ordinator, said they too would meet with the college management once they had spoken to Bheka. Sasco provincial secretary Mqondisi Duma said the lecturer must apologise publicly. The college&rsquo;s principal, Sibhanana Ndlovu praised Bheki for being brave and reporting the matter.&ldquo;The college will investigate the matter internally and the lecturer in question will be disciplined. We&rsquo;ll also make sure that the student gets the support he needs.&rdquo;
