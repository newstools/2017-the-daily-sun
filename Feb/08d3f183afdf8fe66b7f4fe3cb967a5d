THEY call their area Donosa.This is because they are forced to squat and kak in the bush or at the nearby mine dump.They say that all their toilets are full and are not being serviced by the &shy;municipality. Residents of Donosa section in Matholeville squatter camp in Roodepoort, Joburg, said squatting in the bush was risky because thugs often hide out there.The residents claim that they have complained to their local councillor &ndash; but he told them there is nothing he can do.Community leader Angie Mojahi said: &ldquo;We are told the trucks that drain the kak cannot come into our area because the roads leading to the squatter camps are too narrow.&ldquo;We can either use the buckets or go to the bush.&ldquo;When the toilets were delivered to our area the roads were already narrow. These people are just being cocky. I don&rsquo;t know why they can&rsquo;t bring long pipes to drain the kak.&rdquo; Residents said no one cares about them because they are living in a squatter camp.&ldquo;They only know us when it is time to vote, because they benefit while we get nothing in return,&rdquo; said one resident.Spokesman for the City of Joburg Virgil James said they would send the query to the relevant department to resolve the problem as soon as possible. &ldquo;It is not healthy for residents to be living under such conditions,&rdquo; said James.
