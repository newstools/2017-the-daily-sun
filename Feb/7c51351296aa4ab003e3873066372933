DANIEL&rsquo;S debt cost him his house but he is ready to fight back.Daniel Ntuli (63) has written on the walls of the house in Chiawelo, Soweto and says he is not going anywhere.When he took a loan of R2 000 from mashonisa Mishack Ramadzi in August, he left his title deed as surety.Daniel didn&rsquo;t pay the loan and one day made a terrible discovery.&ldquo;I had been cheated out of my own house,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.Daniel said the department of human settlements told him that he was no longer the title deed owner. But Mishack told the People&rsquo;s Paper that Daniel sold the house willingly. &ldquo;We went to the police station three times, where Daniel signed over the house. Now he is changing his story,&rdquo; said Mishack. &ldquo;The house has been sold and the new owner is Tshidi Mathe.&rdquo; Daniel&rsquo;s grandson, Nkosana Ntuli (36), said Daniel is not well, mentally or physically. &ldquo;Somebody from our family was supposed to be there to represent him,&rdquo; Nkosana said.Tshidi (35) said the house is hers.&ldquo;I followed all the procedures with my lawyer and bought the house for R290 000 from Mishack, who told me he was an agent.&rdquo; Gauteng Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said Tshidi is the current owner of the house.&ldquo;We will ask our lawyers to look at both complaints and come up with a final decision as to who is the rightful owner. &ldquo;And we will look at Daniel&rsquo;s medical condition to check whether he was fit enough to sell the house.&rdquo;
