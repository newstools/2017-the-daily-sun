NELSON Mandela Bay&rsquo;s taps will run dry in 15 months if it does not rain. The Metro is on the brink of being declared a disaster area. Barry Martin, the municipality&rsquo;s director of infrastructure and engineering, yesterday raised the alarm. This was during the visit of an international delegation to Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality&rsquo;s disaster management centre in Port Elizabeth.Martin said the metro&rsquo;s water crisis is worsening by the day and will continue if there is no drastic intervention. &ldquo;Our dam levels are now at 49%. We will be declared a disaster area as soon as we go under 40%. We have to cut our use. We are targeting usage of 250 megalitres per day. We are currently using between 290 to 303 megalitres and are way over our target.&ldquo;We will shift our focus to industrial areas and schools as well as people who fill swimming-pools.&rdquo; Last year eight provinces, except for Gauteng, were declared disaster areas due to drought.
