GROWING up in rural Limpopo did nothing to shatter Ashley Makhubele&rsquo;s dreams.Instead, he worked hard to become the successful man he is today.Ashley (25) was born and raised in Julesburg, near Rhulani Village, Limpopo.Drawing inspiration from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Ashley decided to design a social media app called SmartApp.He said his app will give popular social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter a run for their money.He told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;It took almost three years to design this app. &ldquo;SmartApp will bridge the gap between socialising and buying and selling products.&ldquo;The app will be launched later this year.&rdquo;Ashley said many people are looking forward to using his social media app.He currently works at a Pretoria-based civil engineering firm.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret choosing civil engineering as a career because my dream was to learn how to design and construct roads, buildings and bridges. I&rsquo;m in love with anything that has to do with design, which is why I made the app.&rdquo;
