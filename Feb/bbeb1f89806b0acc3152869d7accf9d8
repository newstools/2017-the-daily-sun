A NUN almost landed up in heaven while travelling on a road named after a saint.During her short trip to collect blocks for her convent on Wednesday, Amata Langa (69) overturned her bakkie, but managed to escape death.The bakkie overturned on Old St Faith&rsquo;s Road in Oshabeni, near Port Shepstone on the KZN south coast.When Daily Sun arrived at the scene, gogo Amata was in an ambulance and had suffered minor injuries. She was transported to Assisi Clinic for medical assistance.Amata told the People&rsquo;s Paper she lost control of her bakkie. She suspects the load she was carrying was too heavy for the old vehicle.&ldquo;I had come to take 300 blocks for the convent, but I suspected that amount would be too much for the bakkie to carry. &ldquo;I ended up loading 160 blocks and planned to come back to fetch the remaining 140. &ldquo;While I was driving I felt the vehicle changing direction. &ldquo;I tried to avoid the oncoming motorists and ended up overturning the bakkie. Thank God I survived the accident.&rdquo;One lane had to be closed after the accident.
