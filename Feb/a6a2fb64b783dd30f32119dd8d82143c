IT&rsquo;s been two weeks since blind Nomathendele Nsimbi went missing.The madala (55) from Ndabeni Village at Ndumo, in northern KZN, allegedly went boozing with men in his neighbourhood. His family thought he then went to a relative.He hasn&rsquo;t come home and efforts to find him have been futile. His family fears he might have been kidnapped.His cousin, Nkosini Nsimbi (56), said hopes of finding him alive were very low.&ldquo;The disappearance of elders in this village has become very common. None of them are found alive. An elderly woman who disappeared last month was found mutilated and floating in the river after a few weeks.&rdquo; He said it also happened to another madala from Manguzi in 2014. &ldquo;We appeal to anyone who may have information on my cousin&rsquo;s whereabouts to assist.&rdquo; Nkosini said after the matter was reported to the cops on 6 February, a search was held in the bush nearby. &ldquo;We searched the whole day but did not find him. Even sniffer dogs could not find him.&rdquo; Mathenjwa royal household spokesman Ernest Mathenjwa said: &ldquo;We should work hard to find the culprits so they can pay the price.&rdquo; Colonel Nqobile Gwala confirmed Nomathendele was reported missing on 6 February. &ldquo;If you have information, please call 035 5910 001 or 08600 10111.&rdquo;
