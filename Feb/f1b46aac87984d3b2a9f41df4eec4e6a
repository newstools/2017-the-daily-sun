THESE residents are sick of crime. On Sunday, people from G section in Umlazi, south of Durban, showed their anger by burning down a four-roomed house and two shacks believed to be owned by thugs. Residents hunted down the alleged criminals, saying they wanted to teach them a lesson. However, by the time the crowd got to their homes, they had already fled. The trouble started after four members of the Mzila family were shot and killed on Saturday. The four-roomed house belonged to a suspect, who was shot during a gun fight with cops. Police escorted the suspect&rsquo;s family out of the area on Sunday, but the family&rsquo;s bakkie was stoned by angry residents. A resident said: &ldquo;These thugs are young boys who are driven by drugs. They break into people&rsquo;s houses and rob them.&rdquo;Another resident said: &ldquo;They terrorise us and we don&rsquo;t feel safe at night. I always make sure my door is locked.&rdquo;KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of public violence was opened. &ldquo;A suspect was arrested and is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo; She said a suspect had also been arrested in connection with the Mzila killings. &ldquo;He will appear in the Umlazi Magistrates Court today on charges of murder, attempted murder and robbery. We are still looking for another suspect.&rdquo;
