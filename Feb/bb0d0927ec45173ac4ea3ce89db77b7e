TWO PARAMEDICS were responding to an emergency call.Minutes later, they were lying by the side of the road as patients! The ambulance they were travelling in collided with a huge hippopotamus said to have been crossing the road. The incident took place on the notorious Moloto Road outside Pretoria on Monday night. The hippo, suspected to have come from Roodeplaat Dam, is said to have wrecked the entire front of the ambulance. Life24 emergency services spokeswoman Merica Blake said her colleagues did not see the beast while driving down the road. She believes the lack of road signs warning people about animals in the area could have contributed towards the accident.&ldquo;Moloto Road is famous for car accidents. That is why are extra careful when using the road. The problem though is there are no signs warning motorists about animals around. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have expected something like this to happen,&rdquo; said Blake.The injured paramedics are recovering at a local hospital, while the hippo was reportedly killed on impact. Cassie MacDonald of the SPCA&rsquo;s wildlife unit said the accident was unfortunate and unexpected.She said hippos mainly walk around at night. &ldquo;These animals spend most of their day in the water because of their skin sensitivity and to regulate their body temperature as well. They then go grazing at night.&rdquo; She added that in recent months, hippos have suffered a lot because of the drought and that has forced them to move around more.&ldquo;Because of the drought, hippos have suffered. Even though they are not classified as endangered, they are protected.&ldquo;Drought has forced them to travel long distances to look for food. That on its own endangers them.&rdquo;
