JOMO Cosmos captain Frederic Nsabiyumva believes consistency will be the key for them to finish in the top three in the National First Division (NFD) this season. Ezenkosi have been doing well at home, collecting 13 points in their last five home games. The club recently announced that they would not use Olen Park as their home ground any more but rather Tsakane Stadium due to an unresolved dispute between the local North West municipality and the Leopards rugby team, current tenants of Olen Park. Cosmos are fourth in the standings with 26 points from 17 outings, only one point adrift of Black Leopards and Royal Eagles, who are in the second and third position respectively with 27 points each. Ezenkosi will visit Real Kings at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Sunday (3:30pm). Jomo Sono&rsquo;s charges will go into this game high in confidence after defeating struggling Milano United 2-1 at Tsakane Stadium on Wednesday. Nsabiyumva said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no going back for us now. We have not had a good start to the season in the first round but we are moving in the right direction now. &ldquo;Maintaining consistency is the only thing we need to do to make sure we keep our promotion hopes alive.&ldquo;We have a crucial game this weekend against Kings and we are going there to fight for the win.&rdquo; The two teams played a goalless draw in the first round at Olen Park. Meanwhile, Limpopo based Black Leopards have also raised the bar in the NFD since the arrival of Brazilian mentor Jean Francois Luscuito. Luscuito replaced Jairos Tapera, who was sacked after 10 games in the first round. Lidoda Duvha have played seven games under the Brazilian&rsquo;s tutelage, winning four and drawing the other three.Leopards visit Mbombela United at the KaNyamazane Stadium tomorrow (3:30pm).
