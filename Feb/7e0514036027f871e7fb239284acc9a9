STREET vendors are complaining. They say it&rsquo;s difficult to do business while cows stroll through their trading stalls while they are trying to sell fruit and vegetables.The cows bump into their tables and leave their dung lying around.It is happening in the rural towns of Bhambanana, Mkuze, Jozini, Ndumo and Obonjeni in northern KZN.The vendors said the problem has been going on for three years.They appealed to the Jozini Municipality to implement the by-laws.Vendor Nomasonto Mathenjwa (47) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lose our customers.&ldquo;Nobody wants to buy food in a filthy, stinking place where flies are buzzing around. &ldquo;The cattle bring so much filth. &ldquo;Sometimes they eat cabbages from our tables and destroy our belongings.&rdquo; Resident Magawula Tembe (51) said the matter has often been reported to the former municipal council.&ldquo;Nothing was done. The problem seems to be worsening.&ldquo;We talk about this matter in our villages but the owners of the cattle don&rsquo;t seem to listen. &ldquo;It is difficult to identify the owner of each cow from the large herds we often see in town.&rdquo; Mayor Delani Mabika said his council was working on revising old by-laws in order to implement new ones that will help to deal with the problem.He said the issue of cattle in towns was not as bad as it&rsquo;s made out to be by the vendors.&ldquo;There are just occasional incidents where cattle come to town unattended. Even though it is not acceptable, Jozini is a rural municipality and one can expect this sort of thing to happen.&rdquo;
