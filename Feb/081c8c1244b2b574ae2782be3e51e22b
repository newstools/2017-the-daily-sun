They are selling drugs and prostitution and the municipality is helping them. They must leave."Some foreign nationals faced the group, shouting at them.A group calling itself the Mamelodi Concerned Residents is leading the march to the Department of Home Affairs in protest against immigrants in South Africa.Law enforcement officers will be deployed along the route and at venues where memorandums will be handed over, the cops have said.Earlier on Friday morning, protesters blocked several streets in Atteridgeville, preventing residents from going to work and school.Rocks were thrown and tyres were burnt.Officials later cleared the debris so that traffic could flow freely.Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said the police could not confirm whether or not the protest was related to the march.No injuries were reported and no arrests have been made."Looting of a truck was reported.
