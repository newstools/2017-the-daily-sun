SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter believes the arrival of Mandla Masango can only help to better increase the club's options in attack.Masango previously enjoyed a successful working relationship with Baxter at Kaizer Chiefs, scoring plenty of goals as the club won a variety of major honours.His form for the Glamour Boys won him a move to Randers in Denmark's Superliga in 2015, though in recent times he has fallen out of favour with the Horses.As such, he bagged a loan move to Matsatsantsa in January and is expected to become a major part of the co-Premier Soccer League leader's attack.Baxter said in an official club statement that he hoped this to be the case, saying: "We have a nicely settled squad right now and were not really looking to bring in anyone mid-season, but when the chance came to sign Mandla I had the confidence of having worked with him before so I know he will adapt quickly and hopefully add an extra spark as we compete on domestic and continental fronts."
