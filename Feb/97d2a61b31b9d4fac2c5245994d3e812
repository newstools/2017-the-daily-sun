KASI parents are urged to ensure that the transport that carries their kids to school is roadworthy.They should also make sure the vehicles are not overloaded.That&rsquo;s according to the Eastern Cape Department of Education and the cops.This after the SunTeam saw an overloaded, speeding white bakkie in KwaNoxolo kasi, Port Elizabeth last Friday. The vehicle was loaded with about 20 pupils who were coming back from school. The bakkie didn&rsquo;t even have a canopy to protect the little kids from the scorching sun.Malibongwe Mtima, spokesman for the education department, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We have asked the transport department to help us trace the bakkie.&ldquo;We have also been speaking to parents to stop putting their kids&rsquo; lives at risk. &ldquo;We are running a campaign about the dangers of unroadworthy scholar transport. We hope the parents will work hand-in-hand with us.&rdquo;A principal at a school in Korsten said it was wrong for kids to be transported on unroadworthy vehicles.&ldquo;I tried to raise the matter at a parents&rsquo; meeting last year, but I ended up being ridiculed. It appears some parents don&rsquo;t care about the safety of their kids.&rdquo; A parent said she pays R450 a month to a bakkie owner to drive her grade 9 son to Korsten.&ldquo;Taxis make our kids late for school. Bakkies are used around the area and are cheap.&rdquo;Constable Mncedi Mbombo said: &ldquo;We are totally against the use of bakkies to transport kids to school.&ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s the parents&rsquo; responsibility to check if their children are transported in roadworthy vehicles.&rdquo;
