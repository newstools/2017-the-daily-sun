THE booming sound of stun grenades exploding and the stinging fumes of teargas filled the air outside Greenhills Stadium in Randfontein, west of Joburg yesterday.This after a stubborn EFF crowd tried to force their way into the venue where Gauteng Premier David Makhura was delivering his State of the Province Address.The singing and toyi-toying crowd ran in all directions as the police retaliated.One EFF member turned around and hit a cop with a brick on the chest before disappearing into the crowd.The angry protesters prevented VIP guests from getting to the venue.Some EFF members carried white crosses. One of their placards read: &ldquo;Arrest David Makhura for murder of 94.&rdquo;They held flags and banners referring to the death of mentally ill patients with words like, &ldquo;Remember Life Esidimeni 94&rdquo;.In his speech, Makhura accused officials of hiding facts from him, the minister of health and the health ombudsman. He called on all leaders to handle the matter of migrants with sensitivity and care. This follows the torching of homes in Rosettenville, Joburg and other incidents of violence, xenophobia and vigilantism directed at foreigners in Tshwane and Ekurhuleni.
