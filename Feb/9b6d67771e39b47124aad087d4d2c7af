MAMELODI Sundowns do not know when to stop! The 2016 African Champions League, 2017 African Super Cup and 2015-16 Premiership champions have made a habit of winning everything.The Tshwane giants have added the 2016-17 MultiChoice Diski Challenge crown to their list of accolades with an incredible 4-1 victory over Cape Town City at Sinaba Stadium in Daveyton yesterday.As part of the package for winning the Diski Challenge title, Downs will tour the Netherlands from 17-26 March, where they will take part in the MDC International Cup on 25 March.They will also attend SBV Excelsior&rsquo;s match against AFC Ajax on 19 March before watching the training session of the national Royal Dutch Football Association team.It was second time lucky for Sundowns coach David Notoane, who tried before to claim the trophy without luck &ndash; and third time lucky for the club.The title triumph became a reality after their nearest rivals, Bloemfontein Celtic, lost 6-3 to Baroka FC at Tsakane Stadium.Siwelele had Sundowns sweating throughout the season but Notoane has had the last laugh.Baroka slaughtered Celtic, thanks to a Sepana Letsoalo hat-trick and goals by Brian Masha, Isaac Selemela and Sipho Mmakgolane. Wana Vuyisile and Tshegofatso Mabaso (brace) scored for Celtic. Mabaso is the top scorer with 12 goals. Downs captain Motjeka Madisha, Keletso Makgwala, Samuel Julies and Eric Ntlaba all found the back of the net for the champions, while Shaquile Abrahams was able to score a consolation goal for the Capetonians. The other clubs which have won the trophy are University of Pretoria and Golden Arrows.The scoreboard could have looked worse for City but Downs missed several clear chances in the first half. City keeper Gershin Kock did well to save his side from further embarrassment.
