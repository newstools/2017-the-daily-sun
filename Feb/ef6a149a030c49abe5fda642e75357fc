An in-form Kaizer Chiefs take on struggling Highlands Park in a Premiership encounter at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday.The Glamour Boys are on a good run having won four of their last five league matches while scoring 10 goals along the way.&nbsp;The prolific form of veteran's Siphiwe Tshabalala and Bernard Parker will also no doubt be pleasing to coach Steve Komphela.However, despite the improved results, defender Ramahlwe Mphahlele has warned against complacency. He told the club's official website: "I watched their last game against Polokwane City at home, and obviously they have a good team.&nbsp;"I am actually surprised that they are at the bottom of the log, because they have good players who have the experience of playing at the highest level."We have to be at our best if we want to beat them and switch on from the first whistle to the last and take our chances. In all honesty we are expecting a win against them."In notable team news, Eric Mathoho is unavailable for Chiefs as he is serving a suspension for picking up five yellow cards. For the Lions of the North, Stavros Tsichlas is also out with suspension.&nbsp;
