OLYMPIC silver medallist, Hezekiel Sepeng, has tipped middle-distance specialist, Elroy Gelant, to break the 13-minute barrier in the 5 000m. Sepeng, who is Athletics SA&rsquo;s manager, believes Gelant will enjoy a great year in the track.The 30-year-old is in Kenya attending a one-month training camp with some of the best middle-distance runners in the world.Gelant, who is Caster Semenya&rsquo;s training partner, is coached by Jean Verster. The Rio 2016 Olympian has been sent to Kenya as part of the preparations for the IAAF World Championships to be held in London in August.Sepeng also enjoyed regular training camps in the East African country in the 90s.The late Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, who was coached by Sepeng and veteran runner Hendrick Ramaala, are some of the athletes who reaped the rewards of training with the Kenyans in their country.Gelant, who is a national record holder in the 5 000m, aims to better his time.Sepeng said: &ldquo;South African runners don&rsquo;t believe in training camps lately. But Kenyans are the best in the world because of their camps.&ldquo;Our athletes should have regular training camps with them to improve their performance.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pushing Gelant to break the 13-minute barrier in the 5 000m. He&rsquo;ll return to SA a better runner.&rdquo;Sepeng said Gelant, who returns home later in the week, will return to Kenya for another month.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been struggling to adjust to slow races, but that will soon change. Focus has shifted from qualifying for the finals to securing a place on the podium,&rdquo; Sepeng said.&ldquo;Gelant told me Kenya has opened his eyes as athletes there train in the morning, afternoon and also have night sessions.&ldquo;Now, the plan is to get him on another trip. Maybe, he&rsquo;ll be joined by 10 runners. I had camps in Kenya for years and they helped me achieve better results.&rdquo;
