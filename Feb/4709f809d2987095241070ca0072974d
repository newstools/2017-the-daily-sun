THE bank teller allegedly knew that the owner of a bank account with R1,55 million in it had recently died and the account had been frozen.While on duty, she was captured on the bank CCTV camera apparently helping herself to the money.Katlego Malibe (31), a former FNB bank teller at Bushbuckridge shopping mall, Mpumalanga, appeared in the Mhala Regional Court on Wednesday. She faces six charges of theft, all allegedly committed during her time as an employee of the bank. The theft was discovered after the husband of the woman who died approached the bank about activity on the account. The bank&rsquo;s internal investigation revealed that R1,55 million had been taken illegally. Malibe allegedly withdrew R450 000 from the account on 21 April 2011. Two more transactions of R200 000 each were made on 26 and 28 April. Amounts totalling about R300 000 were withdrawn on 4 and 6 May.On Wednesday the court reviewed the video footage on the days the offences were allegedly committed, with forensic investigator Charleen Govender and bank fraud unit investigator Thomas George giving evidence. Branch manager Lionel Barnabas testified that the accused was one of their employees and said she was trained to treat clients&rsquo; information with privacy. She knew she was not allowed to make any transaction without the provision of positive identification. &ldquo;We have forms for whistle-blowers, and if she was being compelled to commit the crime, she could have reported the matter to the branch or regional manager,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have documents that prove she attended all the training. The bank lost R1,55 million that we have to repay to our customer, because it was a member of our staff who committed the crime.&rdquo;Magistrate Elmarie Theron postponed the case to 10 March to allow for Malibe to consult her lawyer. Her bail has been extended.
