MAYBE the tight security and news of soldiers being sent to Parliament had something to do with it.The State of the Nation Address red carpet was as dull as ditchwater. Even though the red carpet was rolled out for guests and ministers, no one walked on it - they crossed it on their way into the National Assembly. Few guests or ministers rocked the fashion stakes.Even Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba and his wife, regarded as a celebrity couple in past years, didn&rsquo;t have the sizzle factor. Dali Tambo and wife Rachel gave it a shot but still there was no cigar. National Freedom Party leader Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi was hot in her red number but it was painful to see her walking with difficulty due to illness.The best traditionally dressed had to be Mashledi Mojalefa. As expected,the EFF didn&rsquo;t entertain the fashion parade and arrived in their trademark red overalls, with women delegates sporting red pants and black T-shirts.EFF treasurer Leigh-Ann Mathys paraded her charms even in simple red pants and an ordinary shirt.Typically, the DA did not miss a chance like the red carpet, to steal a moment. Its leader Mmusi Maimane and other leaders were the only ones to walk the red carpet with a banner remembering the mentally ill patients who died at NGOs last year.
