SOCCER PLAYERS BEWARE!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a con artist out there ready to cheat you out of your money.&nbsp; HE PRETENDS TO BE AN AGENT BUT HE IS NO MORE THAN A CHEAP CROOK. The bogus agent pretends to be Free State Stars&rsquo; boss, Rantsi Mokoena. He tried to convince Baroka FC&rsquo;s show-boating YouTube sensation Tshepo &ldquo;Skhwama sa Matariana&rdquo; Matete and a coach simply known as Mathe to deposit money into his bank account. He said he would fly them to Bethlehem where Stars are based and get them fixed up with contracts at Ea Lla Koto. The scam took another turn when former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Steven Ncanana arrived at OR Tambo airport on Monday expecting to fly to Bethlehem to join Ea La Koto, after being contacted by a man impersonating Mokoena. But there&rsquo;s no airport at Bethlehem at all. Mokoena is furious that the con man is using his name: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s infuriating that this imposter is using my good name and that of the club to try and con players and coaches out of money with false promises. &ldquo;He must be stopped. I want to make sure everyone knows about this &ndash; don&rsquo;t give this con man money.&ldquo;He tries to trick people by saying he is Rantsi Mokoena and that they must deposit R4 500 into his account to pay for a flight to Bethlehem, and that they would get a trial or job when they arrive.&rdquo;It&rsquo;s a huge scam, stressed Mokoena: &ldquo;Firstly, there is no airport in Bethlehem. Secondly, we pay players&rsquo; and coaches&rsquo; expenses to travel to Bethlehem if we are interested in them. This guy is completely bogus.&rdquo;Former Chiefs star Abel Shongwe is Matete&rsquo;s agent and was shocked when his player told him of the con man.Daily Sun is in possession of the bogus agent&rsquo;s cell number. He failed to answer his phone despite several attempts to contact him yesterday. Shongwe said: &ldquo;Tshepo smelled a rat when so-called Rantsi told him to deposit money for a flight to Bethlehem, as he knows there are no flights to that town. &ldquo;I know Rantsi well, having recently sold Mohammed Anas to him. I told Tshepo to forget about the incident. I&rsquo;ll sort it out.&ldquo;The corruption in South Africa is sickening. People are trying to con players out of hard-earned money. Luckily Tshepo was too clever for him.&rdquo;
