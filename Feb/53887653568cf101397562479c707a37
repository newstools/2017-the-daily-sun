CLAUDIA Mutlanyana (43) feels no sorrow now that her brother is dead.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy my brother is dead. It&rsquo;s good riddance. The community will finally be at peace now that he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Claudia.Her brother, Thabiso Mutlanyana (38), was shot dead two weeks ago during a gang-related incident in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. &ldquo;He was a monster who destroyed the lives of many people and caused havoc in the community,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I hope God forgives his sins because as a family, we have not forgiven him.&rdquo;She claimed her brother was involved in crimes such as robbery, drug dealing, human trafficking, hijacking, house breaking and business robbery.To make things worse he recruited young vulnerable boys to do his dirty work.&ldquo;Our parents died when we were very young and we grew up as orphans. That affected him badly as he got exposed to a life of crime,&rdquo; said Claudia. She said her brother found himself sucked into a world of darkness.&ldquo;He did very bad things that I can&rsquo;t even describe. He caused so much. Today people still look at me and point fingers, holding me responsible for his actions. It won&rsquo;t be easy to clear our family name of his evil deeds.&rdquo;SAPS spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa confirmed that police are investigating a case of murder.
