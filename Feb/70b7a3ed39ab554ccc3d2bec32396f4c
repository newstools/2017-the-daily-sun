Dear MizzBPlease help me. My teenage daughter has sores on her private parts and she complains of a bad smell and a discharge. I do not know what to do because she said she is a lesbian.Although I struggle to accept her lifestyle, I thought it meant I would not have worry about sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. How do I support her? -&nbsp; ParentDear ParentIt is good that you have an open relationship with your child. The first thing you need to do is take her to the doctor so she can get treatment. Every relationship that involves unprotected sex carries the risk of sexually transmitted infections. Encourage your daughter to call a support group such as LoveLife for more information.
