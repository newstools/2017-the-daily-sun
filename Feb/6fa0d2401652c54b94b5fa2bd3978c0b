FORMER Mamelodi Sundowns and Zimbabwe national team coach, Ian Gorowa, wants to start afresh.This after the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) lifted his ban for alleged match-fixing involvement.A relieved Gorowa told SunSport he was happy his name had been cleared and wanted to focus on getting back to his first love &ndash; football. He said he couldn&rsquo;t wait to shout out instructions from the dugout.&nbsp;Gorowa was banned for 10 years after he was suspected of attempting to fix the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between the Zim Warriors and Swaziland in March last year. He had always maintained his innocence.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a happy man now because it has been a very tough year. I didn&rsquo;t know whether I was coming or going, but this is a closed chapter now.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want my life back now,&rdquo; said the former Moroka Swallows mentor.&nbsp;He said he received a letter from Zifa president, Phillip Chiyangwa, last week confirming the lifting of the suspension.&ldquo;It has been a long year for me, but I always knew I was innocent. It was not easy for me, but God kept me going as I never lost hope.&nbsp;&ldquo;I learned to accept things that I had no control over and left everything in God&rsquo;s hands. Today I can safely say God has heard my prayers as I&rsquo;m a free man.&rdquo; He said he wanted to get back to football soon and believed he still had a lot to offer.&ldquo;I kept myself busy, reading the latest coaching methodologies because I knew I would be back. I&rsquo;m readily available now and eager to offer my services to any club that needs me.&rdquo;
