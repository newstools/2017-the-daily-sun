AN ELDERLY woman said she was promised a house, and she reapplied during the local government elections on 3 August.Now she is wondering what became of her application. Sarah Siwela &ndash; who lives in a two-roomed house near Mbombela in Mpumalanga &ndash; said she was promised her vote would seal her RDP house application. The gogo said ward councillors have forgotten what they promised.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was assured that I would get an RDP house. I applied several times, especially at election time, but until today, I live in this unfinished house and it is hard.&rdquo; Life is difficult for the 66-year-old pensioner who lives at Gobhoza, in Daantjie just outside Mbombela.She shares the house with her three grandkids and her daughter. &ldquo;I wish I could get a new house so my grandkids could grow up in a warm home.&rdquo;The department of human settlements confirmed that Sarah applied for the house in 2013. Department spokesman Freddy Ngobe said: &ldquo;As she applied for a house she is in line to receive a house in due course. Each year we build 10 000 and there are many people who need houses.&rdquo; &ndash; AENS
