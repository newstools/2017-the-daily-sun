Dear MizzBI am an HIV-positive woman of 22. Now that I know I am dying, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I have not even told my family because I feel like I have disappointed them. How do I tell my loved ones about this? I need their support.- Needing SupportDear Needing SupportIt is not easy to find out you are HIV-positive.However, it is important to know that HIV is not a death sentence if you are willing to change your lifestyle. Your plans for the future do not have to change. You can still study, get married and have children. All you have to do is to practise caution. Once you have educated yourself about living with HIV, it will be easier for you to talk to other people about it. This is probably one of the most difficult situations you have ever faced, but your life is not over.Your goals and dreams are still waiting for you to pursue them. Your success will depend on your attitude towards the condition.
