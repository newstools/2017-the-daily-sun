CORRUPTION Watch has a message for officials guilty of demanding bribes.&ldquo;The public is no longer prepared to play along with this type of transaction,&rdquo; said the organisation.It said the public is now more vigilant about reporting these incidents, as well as the names of those involved in corruption. It urged the public to stop being willing participants in this form of corruption, adding that as long as the public continues to pay bribes, the problem will continue. The message follows an incident in which a Tshwane Metro cop was found guilty of corruption in the Cullinan Magistrates Court on Wednesday for asking for a R100 bribe.It was reported that the 38-year-old officer pleaded guilty to requesting a bribe from an undercover agent of the National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit on December 2015. She was charged under the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act of 2004 and is due to appear in court on 29 March for the magistrate to consider the pre-sentencing report. Ronald Menoe, deputy director of Corruption Watch, asked members of the public to report corruption to the toll-free number 0800 23456 or through a WhatsApp number on 072 013 5569.
