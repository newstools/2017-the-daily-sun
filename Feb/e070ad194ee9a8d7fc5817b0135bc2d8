MZANSI&rsquo;S fastest man Akani Simbine wants to follow in his idol Usain Bolt&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp;After his meteoric rise in the sport last year, all eyes will be on Simbine in major world athletics competitions this year.The sprinter won the hearts of fans worldwide after his impressive performance at the Olympic Games and Diamond League series last season.In June, Simbine and world 400m record holder, Wayde Van Niekerk, will stage their final training camp with Olympic superstar, Bolt, in the year of the Jamaican great&rsquo;s retirement.&nbsp;Bolt holds Simbine in high esteem and the South African sprint ace is tipped to take over from one of the best sprinters in history.Simbine said: &ldquo;Taking over from Bolt is a big thing, doing the 100m and 200m is a big deal.&ldquo;Bolt is the king of athletics and track. I&rsquo;ll do everything to try and pick his brain, so that when he&rsquo;s gone I&rsquo;ll also go places.&rdquo;&nbsp;The 23-year-old is no longer aiming to reach the finals, but is determined to secure a podium finish in major events this season.His European season kicks off in May and he is seen as a contender in both the 100m and 200m events at the IAAF World Championships, in London, in August.Simbine told SunSport: &ldquo;I have expectations of myself and that is to bring medals home. I want to go out there and get the job done.&rdquo;Athletics South Africa (ASA) have introduced the Speed Series in four cities: Bloemfontein, Durban, Potchefstroom and Germiston.The first leg is starting in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, on 28 February.But Simbine, who is a big Liverpool fan, will only compete in one of the track and field series in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, on 22 March due to a hectic programme.He said: &ldquo;I will do the Germiston meeting. I also hope to bring fire to the track once again.&rdquo; His main goal is to win the Diamond League Series this season.Simbine, who finished fifth in the 100m Olympic Games final, is hoping to win a medal in London. But he was disappointed in ASA for denying him an opportunity to run the 200m final at the Olympics. He believes he could have stolen a medal. Simbine told SunSport: &ldquo;I felt like I was left out. My form speaks for itself.&rdquo; His first official race abroad will be in Doha, Qatar, in May. And he will also compete in a Jamaican meeting.
