THE parents of Yiboni Primary School pupils are up in arms!They want the KZN Department of Education to stop hawkers from selling chips and other products to kids at the KwaMakhutha school, south of Durban. This was after more than 40 pupils were rushed to hospital after eating chips that had allegedly expired.On Friday, pupils fell sick after buying packets of chips from two young men during break. The pupils were taken by bus to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, where they were treated and discharged.Parent Nonhlanhla Mkhize (35) said even though the pupils were recovering and had returned to school yesterday, she fears that something worse may happen in future.&ldquo;The products sold to our kids cannot be trusted. &ldquo;This must stop and parents should prepare lunch boxes for their kids.&rdquo; Another parent, Sihle Vezi (41) said if the hawkers are allowed, they should be given a list of things to sell and be monitored on a regular basis.&ldquo;What I saw was really terrible. I did not see the packs of chips but was told they had expired. &ldquo;The two hawkers have still not been found,&rdquo; said Sihle.Principal Mduduzi Kheswa said he could not comment much about the matter as he was not authorised to do so.Kheswa said the empty chip packs have been taken for investigation.Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for KZN Education MEC, said he was not aware of the incident.&ldquo;We will first wait for the report from the district office before we start an investigation.&rdquo; Mthethwa could not say if the hawkers would be stopped from selling at schools.&ldquo;The department has a nutritional programme that provides pupils with meals enough to last the day,&rdquo; Mthethwa told Daily Sun.&ldquo;We urge parents to encourage their children to stick to our meals. &ldquo;The programme was initiated to avoid such incidents.&rdquo;
