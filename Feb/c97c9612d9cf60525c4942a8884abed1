THE correctional services department in Gauteng is investigating a fire at a prison that claimed two lives. The blaze started after a fight broke out between two inmates at Zonderwater Prison in Cullinan, Tshwane. Two prisoners suffered severe burn wounds and they were rushed to Tembisa Hospital, where they later died. It is still not known how the fire started. Acting regional correctional services commissioner Mandla Mkabela described the action as unlawful and barbaric.The two dead inmates were identified as Ernest Malope and Thulani Nkwashu.Malope was serving a 15-year sentence for the illegal possession of firearms as well as parole violation.Nkwashu was serving 29 years for robbery, theft and housebreaking with aggravating circumstances.Mkabela said an internal investigation had been opened to establish the facts.&ldquo;The burning of state property is a criminal offence and can never be acceptable. &ldquo;It is unfortunate that during the incident two offenders lost their lives,&rdquo; he said.A warder told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We rushed to the cells when we saw the smoke. &ldquo;When we got there the fire was already out of control. &ldquo;We evacuated the inmates, but two of them were trapped in the burning cell.&rdquo;
