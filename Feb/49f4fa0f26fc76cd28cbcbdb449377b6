THE dead mean nothing to these criminals. They target anyone who sets foot inside Odi Cemetery in Mabopane, north of Tshwane. The heartless thugs break into mourners&rsquo; cars and snatch handbags or anything valuable they can lay their hands on. This has left many people afraid to enter the graveyard. Thugs hide behind tombstones when people attend funerals. They wait for mourners to gather at the grave of the person being buried before carrying out their evil acts. It is believed that the thugs gain entry through the broken palisade fence surrounding the graveyard.A victim, Jack Mazibandela (48), from Soshanguve said he thought his car would be safe if he parked inside the cemetery. But he was shocked when after the burial, he found the back window on the driver&rsquo;s side shattered.&ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s handbag with her cash, diary and important documents were stolen. She had put them under the driver&rsquo;s seat for safety before we got out of the car but the thieves managed to get them anyway.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said so far, eight people have been robbed at the cemetery. &ldquo;We are investigating a number of cases where people reported that they were robbed or had their cars broken into while visiting graves.&rdquo; He said police were following up on the information and were hoping to arrest the robbers soon. He urged people to report any suspicious people to the guards or the Loate cops on 012 797 7800.
