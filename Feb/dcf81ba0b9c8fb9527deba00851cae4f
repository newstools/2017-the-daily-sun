DJ ZINHLE has allegedly taken a leaf out of Bonang Matheba&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;DJ Zinhle, real name Ntombezinhle Jiyane, is accused of doing what Bonang did to her with AKA.She stole her man!The DJ from Danhauser, in KZN, is accused of stealing her current boyfriend, Brendon Naidoo, from businesswoman, Nokulunga Msomi.Two years ago, DJ Zinhle won many people&rsquo;s hearts when it was reported that she had lost her baby daddy and award-winning rapper AKA to TV personality Bonang Matheba.But this week, Nokulunga&rsquo;s close friends told Sunday Sun of how Brendon played with the businesswoman&rsquo;s heart after they met in Thailand.The friends, who asked to remain anonymous, claimed they felt pity for their friend.This after she found out through Instagram that the man she was dating was also dating DJ Zinhle.One friend said: &ldquo;Brendon behaves as if he&rsquo;s the hero for saving DJ Zinhle &ndash; yet he played with Nokulunga&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;Another friend alleged that Nokulunga and Brendon had been dating for two months when she found out he was cheating on her with DJ Zinhle.&ldquo;It sickens me to see how this Brendon guy is being embraced. All this time he kept telling Nokulunga they were just friends. I know for a fact that Brendon lied to Zinhle and told her he was single. We know Zinhle is not at fault, but Brendon is.&ldquo;We know Zinhle doesn&rsquo;t believe in building something out of another woman&rsquo;s tears,&rdquo; the source said.A third friend claimed: &ldquo;Nokulunga called off her engagement to her ex-fiance who wanted to make her his second wife.&ldquo;She wanted to start something new with Brendon. She felt at home with him. She felt she could take on the world with him.&ldquo;But she had no idea that in a few weeks&rsquo; time she&rsquo;d discover the same guy she trusted was starting something new with DJ Zinhle.&ldquo;All she wanted was for Brendon to apologise for breaking her heart,&rdquo; the source said.When Nokulunga was contacted for comment, she neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.She told the SunTeam: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on myself. My brand and I don&rsquo;t want to talk about things and pains of the past. I wish them all the best, but karma is there for all of us.&rdquo;&nbsp;When Brendon was asked to comment, he denied knowing Nokulunga, but when told about text messages in SunTeam&rsquo;s possession, he hung up. DJ Zinhle refused to comment and hung up the phone.
