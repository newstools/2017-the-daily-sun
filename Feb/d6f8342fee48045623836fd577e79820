WHILE Mthokozisi Mdlalose was filling up his Toyota Yaris in the Durban CBD on Wednesday, he admired the silver Golf 6 GTi parked at the petrol station.And the part-time student from Empangeni was shocked when he realised he was looking at his own car, which was hijacked last year!Thinking quickly, the Empangeni cop&rsquo;s son confronted the driver, and when the man only mumbled and did not reply, Mthokozisi knocked him out and grabbed the car&rsquo;s keys.Mthokozisi (28) said he recognised the Golf as his car, which was hijacked in November, even though the number plates had been changed.&ldquo;I then sped off in my Yaris to the Berea Police Station 3km away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cops went back with me to the petrol station. We found my Golf still parked there, but the driver was gone. &ldquo;The cops towed my Golf to the police pound in Isipingo, pending an investigation,&rdquo; he said.Mthokozisi said his Golf was hijacked from Durban University of Technology&rsquo;s ML Sultan Campus parking area. The part-time operational management student, who works as a container machine operator, said four armed men confronted him and forced him out of the Golf before driving off in it. &ldquo;I opened a case of hijacking, but now I have found the Golf on my own,&rdquo; he said.He said he had bought the car through a bank loan.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a case of hijacking was opened last year after Mthokozisi reported four men pointed guns at him and took his Golf.
