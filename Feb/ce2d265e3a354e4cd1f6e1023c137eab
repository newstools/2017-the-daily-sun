SINCE last year, life has gone from bad to worse for gogo Ellen Goodman (74). On 19 September, Daily Sun published a story about Ellen&rsquo;s 42-year-old son, who set her house on fire after the gogo wouldn&rsquo;t give him R50 for a magosha.Now gogo Ellen&rsquo;s house in the Skierlik section of Bekkersdal, Gauteng is falling apart.The local construction company, Makgothamishe, has taken down the roof, leaving gogo&rsquo;s house exposed to the rain and sun. The rats have also moved into the house.&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t these people leave my roof? Now I am forced to sleep at my makoti&rsquo;s place. &ldquo;This is not right. The construction company must replace my roof,&rdquo; said gogo Ellen.Thabo Duma, liaison officer at the construction company, said they approached the gogo to fix the house.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t finish the job and we apologise for that. However, we have run out of cash and we can&rsquo;t even pay the subcontractors. We are working hard to resolve the matter and ask the gogo to be patient.&rdquo; Gogo Ellen&rsquo;s neighbour, Samson Thobela, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The elders are the first people who should be respected. &ldquo;I always go to the gogo&rsquo;s house to make sure that thugs don&rsquo;t target it.&rdquo;He said he treated gogo Ellen as his mum.&ldquo;She has taught us love and unity,&rdquo; said Samson.Meanwhile, Ellen&rsquo;s son appeared in the Westonaria Magistrates Court on 30 January, and will appear again on 27 March. He is being kept in jail after being refused bail.
