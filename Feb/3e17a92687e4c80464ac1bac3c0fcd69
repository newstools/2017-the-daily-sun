RESIDENTS of this village are fed up!The people of Dzwerani Village near Vuwani, Limpopo said they have been crying for a tarred road for a long time but with no luck.Two weeks ago, the angry villagers barricaded the road leading to the area with rubbish, burning tyres and big rocks.It happened after officials from Thulamela Municipality didn&rsquo;t arrive for a follow up meeting with the villagers.On Thursday, the community met again at the crossroads outside the village, waiting for the officials from the public works department and the municipality, but they didn&rsquo;t arrive.This left villagers angry and they took to the streets again.About 21 residents were bust and later released on free bail.Community leader Avhatakali Makhado said: &ldquo;Our road from the crossroads to Mashawana is so bad. &ldquo;Buses and taxis no longer come to our village because of the condition of the road. &ldquo;People are forced to walk kilometres to the main road to catch buses and taxis, and it&rsquo;s not safe to walk near the bush early in the morning and in the evening.&ldquo;We spoke to the municipality and public works several times but with no luck. They even failed to attend our meeting with them.&rdquo;Ndwamato Tshiila, spokesman for Thulamela Municipality, said the road in now being handled by the public works department. &ldquo;As a municipality, we are prepared to work with public works to improve the road for the benefit of our residents.&rdquo;
