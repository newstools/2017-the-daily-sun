THE fears of the Mabude family have turned into pain.This after their kidnapped boy, Vusumzi Mabude (14), was allegedly killed the same day he was taken and his body stuffed into a pit toilet. A relative (53) is expected to appear in the Mbizana Magistrates Court today for allegedly planning with two youths to kidnap and kill Vusumzi.Daily Sun published the story last Tuesday. Vusumzi was last seen alive the previous Friday in Nkantolo Village, Bizana. The alleged kidnappers had been calling and sending SMSes to the family, demanding R6 000, which was allegedly owed by the boy&rsquo;s dad, Vuyisile.Colonel Nomazwi Nkombisa, the acting cluster commander, said police made a breakthrough on Friday when the investigating officer obtained a warrant granting him access to the phone records. The phone number used was tracked to Bizana CBD and later to Nkantolo Village. &ldquo;It led to one of the suspects, who confessed that he and a friend killed the boy the day they kidnapped him,&rdquo; said Nkombisa. &ldquo;The two suspects were employed at Nkantolo Junior Secondary School as temporary cleaners. &ldquo;The victim knew them from the village, and they called him to come and help them. &ldquo;Then they pulled him into a classroom, strangled him and placed his body in a wheelbarrow before stuffing it down a toilet on the school premises.&rdquo;The suspects, aged 20 and 23, are said to have named a relative of the victim as the person who told them to commit the crime. Family spokeswoman Akhona Njenjani said Vusumzi&rsquo;s mum, Bhekiswa fainted when she heard the news and had to be treated for shock. &ldquo;He was their firstborn child and as his name suggests, they had faith that he would grow up to lead the family.&rdquo;
