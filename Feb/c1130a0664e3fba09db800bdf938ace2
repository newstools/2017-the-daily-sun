Revenge will be the underlying factor for Ajax Cape Town when they host Cape Town City at the Cape Town Stadium in the Premiership on Saturday.Cape Town City, who were formed after the purchase of the Black Aces franchise by former Ajax boss John Comitis, won the first round encounter in September 1-0 thanks to a goal by Bongolwethu Jayiya.Since then, they've gone on to win the Telkom Knockout competition and currently sit atop of the league standings with Supersport and Bidvest Wits.Ajax, meanwhile, have had to watch as the Mother City upstarts have grabbed the headlines and hogged the limelight.They also endured a torrid run of form in the opening three months of the season which cost head coach Roger De Sa his job.The new man in charge, Stenley Menzo, seemed to be turning things around with some good form in November and December, only to see the confidence shattered on the return from the mid-season break with a 5-0 hiding away at Wits earlier this week.While the Urban Warriors were being thrashed up in Johannesburg, City cruised to a 3-0 win over Highlands Park at home, with former Ajax player Lebogang Manyama again on the score-sheet for the team he now captains.So far, the script could not have been written better for Comitis, head coach Eric Tinkler and the new club as a whole.Going into Saturday's derby, Ajax are in 11th position after claiming nine points from their last five matches, while the Citizens are joint-top having picked up seven points from their previous five games, including a 4-0 reverse to Platinum Stars just days after winning the Telkom Knockout - their only real poor performance of the season.The shots have been firing all week out of both camps, with both Comitis and Ajax CEO Ari Efstathiou having been vocal.Comitis took a jab at his former club by referencing the fact that they are in effect a satellite club of Ajax Amsterdam."Both teams have got to be from Cape Town to call it a derby," he said jokingly. "No, it's a great event for Cape Town and for football. We don't underestimate any opposition, and can't disrespect this game."If the guys don't roll their sleeves up, we'll be in trouble as it's a derby and will be a tough game," he cautioned.Efstathiou felt his team were short-changed in the opening round game and admits pride was hurt."I think we could have pulled off a result," said Efstathiou on the club's website."But - to be honest - we didn't deserve a win, maybe a draw. They were at the time a little more geared up, I think this time it is the reverse, and I am quite confident that we are in the driving seat this time around."The players are committed, I think their pride also got dented last time around. You go around in Cape Town as the losing team, whether you are an administrator, attend to the fields or you are a player - you still get the flack of losing."We all want to be on the winning side and we want to claim our rightful position as 'the' Cape Town team. We have been in existence for 17 years and we have got the majority of the support. We are going out there to win the game."Ajax will be sweating on the fitness of top goal scorer Prince Nxumalo, who missed the midweek game after suffering from an epilepsy attack, an issue which has happened before.Defender Roscoe Pietersen is likely to miss the game with an ankle injury while Zambian midfielder Aubrey Funga is still waiting for a work permit.Cape Town City reserve keeper Samora Motloung is sidelined for several weeks, but striker Lehlohonolo Majoro should be available again after recovering from injury.
