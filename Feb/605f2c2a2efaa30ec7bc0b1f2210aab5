The latest wellness buzz is all around pH detoxing &ndash;&ensp;but what does it mean?&nbsp; The people who promote detoxing say it is a way of removing toxins and acidity that builds up in the body over years to reset your body to a healthy balance.&nbsp; Detox experts claim that an acidic body is an ideal breeding ground for cancer. The pH value is how we measure the chemical acidity or alkalinity of a substance. -&thinsp;pH 0 to 7 is acidic.&nbsp; -&thinsp;pH of 7 is neutral. -&thinsp;pH 7 to 14 is alkaline. The body is able to maintain a healthy pH balance with the lungs, but if the blood pH drops too low then increased breathing will expel extra acidity or excrete it through the kidneys and bladder. The least acidic drinks include water, unsweetened green teas and rooibos tea, while milk is slightly less acidic with a pH of around six.&nbsp; In general, pure water should have a neutral pH of seven. However the pH of surface water systems and groundwater systems can range between six and eight and a half.&nbsp; To improve alkalinity in sparkling and still water, alkaline salts such as sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate can be added, or easier yet, include some alkaline fruits or vegetables and improve flavour at the same time.&nbsp; So next time, why not try adding these alkaline fruits to liven up your water &ndash; apples, grapefruit, peaches, pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, melons, naartjies, figs, mangoes, papayas, lemons and limes.&nbsp; Here is an alkaline detox recipe from SodaStream: The sparkling fruity apple cider vinegar and rooibos tea detox&nbsp; Ingredients&nbsp; -&thinsp; Two rooibos teabags&nbsp; -&thinsp; Apple cider vinegar&nbsp; - Lemon or lime wedges.
