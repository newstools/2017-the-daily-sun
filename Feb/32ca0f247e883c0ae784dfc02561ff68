Kaizer Chiefs have tabled offers to midfielders Willard Katsande and George Maluleka as they look to keep the pair at the club for the foreseeable future.Katsande has become something of a stalwart in the holding position in front of the back four for Chiefs, while Maluleka has consistantly displayed his potential to become a star for the club.As such, Amakhosi football manager Bobby Motaung has confirmed that negotiations are underway with the pair and offers have been made for the two players to extend their stay at Naturena. He added that talks are also underway with Tsepo Masilela and Lucky Baloyi.He told the club's official website, "We are working around the clock to review the contracts of Lucky Baloyi, Willard Katsande, Tsepo Masilela and George Maluleka."Proposals are on the table with regard to Katsande and Maluleka. We are waiting for Katsande to return from national team duty to continue with the negotiations. We are looking to finalise Maluleka's deal by the end of the week."
