&ldquo;THOU shalt not steal,&rdquo; says the Good Book &ndash; but it seems not everyone in this community sings from the same sheet.When congregants of the New Life Centre Ministries in Evaton West, south of Joburg arrived at church on Sunday morning they were in for a shock.They opened the church doors and found half the chairs gone.A quick count found that more than 140 of the church&rsquo;s 350 chairs were missing. The church building is used for many activities during the week by the community and serves as a mobile clinic, a place for a feeding scheme and a safe place for children to play.Church spokesman and evangelist Petrus Makeleng (55) told Daily Sun this wasn&rsquo;t the first time their church had been robbed.&ldquo;The church service on Sunday continued with some of the congregants standing.&rdquo; Another pastor, Moses Lehlake (31), said they were disappointed by the act as the church never hesitated to give back to the community. &ldquo;The community should respect God&rsquo;s things.&rdquo; Lehlake pleaded with good Samaritans who are willing to assist to come forward. &ldquo;We would appreciate any help we can get.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa said a case of business robbery had been opened. &ldquo;No suspect has been arrested yet, but police are investigating.&rdquo;
