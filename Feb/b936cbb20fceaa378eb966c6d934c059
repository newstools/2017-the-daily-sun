STRUGGLING interim Bloemfontein Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema has questioned his players&rsquo; commitment. The former Orlando Pirates skipper has seen his players lose two matches in a row early in the second round of Absa Premiership. These back-to-back defeats happened in the space of three days. Celtic first lost 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns last Wednesday and on Saturday were beaten 2-1 by Golden Arrows. The results left Seema unable to hold back regarding his frustrations with under-performing players. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if these players are even thinking of their supporters who travel everywhere week in and week out to come and watch them play. &ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t know if they are thinking about the club&rsquo;s brand. This is bad, really bad,&rdquo; said Seema. The Arrows defeat was the seventh in 16 matches for Phunya Sele Sele and leaves them in 13th position in the Absa Premiership standings. Their last win was back in December when they beat the Buccaneers 2-1. Seema, who is assisted by the club&rsquo;s former captain, John Maduka, said it was time for the players to take responsibility. He said there was no time to be nice to them any more. &ldquo;The players are professionals and grown-ups. They should think hard about the brand and respect it. There is no time to talk nicely to them, they should pick themselves up and take responsibility for their actions,&rdquo; added Seema. The former Lesotho international is hoping things will change when they meet Chippa United and Platinum Stars in their next home matches. &ldquo;We will see how things go. We have Chippa (on Sunday) and Platinum Stars (25 February) at home, and I hope we will be able to collect six points in these matches. If we fail to win at home, I don&rsquo;t know what more I can do as a coach.&rdquo;Seema and Maduka took charge of Celtic late in October after the departure of Serame Letsoaka, who has since joined neighbours Free State Stars.
