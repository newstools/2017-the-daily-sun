BIDVEST Wits will be hoping to continue their winning form this weekend when they host Saint-Louisienne in the return leg of their Caf Champions League preliminary round match.

He will want to find the back of the net again, as he did in the first leg.Wits&rsquo; away goal could prove vital to help them reach the first round of competition, where they would face Egyptian giants Al Ahly. SuperSport United and Platinum Stars will also be in action with the aim of qualifying for the first round of the Caf Confederation Cup. SuperSport will hope Lucas Moripe Stadium (3.30pm) is their happy hunting ground on Sunday. Their 0-0 draw with Elgeco Plus in the first leg has put them under pressure, as they have to score without conceding. Coach Stuart Baxter will be looking to players such as Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Thuso Phala, Thabo Mnyamane and Cole Alexander to intimidate the Elgeco defence and score some goals.Dikwena are in a better position against Uniao Desportiva do Songo with a goal in hand after a 1-0 win at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium last week.
