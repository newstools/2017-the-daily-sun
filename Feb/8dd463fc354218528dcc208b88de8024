ACTRESS Ntando Duma is fuming.&nbsp;This after being allegedly left high and dry by a so-called friend.&nbsp;The Rhythm City star, who plays Zinzi Dandala on the e.tv&rsquo;s soapie, apparently has a score to settle with Lunga &ldquo;Skippa&rdquo; Dlamini.&nbsp;The sexy vixen, who is engaged to Gagasi FM hip hop DJ Junior Da Rocka, is said to be upset.&nbsp;This after Skippa, who is linked to local rap royalty Emtee and DJ Citi Lyts, among others, is said to owe her R12&thinsp;000.In an apparent fit of calculated rage, Ntando took to social media to vent &ndash; in a post that was removed after a few minutes.&nbsp;When contacted for comment, Ntando cautiously confirmed the bad blood.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this in the media. I will sort him out myself,&rdquo; Ntando said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The guy has even blocked me on social media and won&rsquo;t take my calls.&nbsp;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get hold of him, that is why I went the social media route.&nbsp;&ldquo;But he must rest assured, I will find him and fix him,&rdquo; she told the SunTeam.&nbsp;Sources close to the matter painted a grim picture of Skippa &ndash; even going as far as alleging that he was a con man.&nbsp;One mole claimed that Skippa had &ldquo;no concept of repaying his debt&rdquo;, and alleged that there was more to Ntando&rsquo;s anger.&nbsp;&ldquo;That post was all about the money she loaned Skippa when he was arrested two months ago,&rdquo; the mole claimed.&nbsp;&ldquo;As if that was not enough, the guy had ordered four bottles of Hennessy at an event he had booked Ntando for in KwaZulu-Natal.&nbsp;&ldquo;But the fault here is that he ordered these drinks in Ntando&rsquo;s name. But we all know that Ntando doesn&rsquo;t mess with alcohol.&rdquo;&nbsp;Skippa was not available for comment and he also failed to return our SMSes at the time of going to press.&nbsp;
