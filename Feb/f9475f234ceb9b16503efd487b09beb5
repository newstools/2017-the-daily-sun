FOR a team that is playing catch up in the Absa Premiership campaign, Mamelodi Sundowns are displaying all the right signs and quality to overhaul the leaders at the top of the table. They have it all to do if they are to get closer to the teams at the top though, but they are showing some encouraging signs. It was not pretty, but it was effective as they produced a hard fought 1-0 victory over an unlucky Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium last night. The Tshwane giants did not play their free flowing football as they survived a scare by Celtic, but they got the job done to get closer to the top five. Themba Zwane curled in a beauty 12 minutes from time to kick start their chase in the league title race. For a team that has played football none stop the six week break seem to have affected their rhythm. The Brazilians are playing catch up in the league after their successful run in the Caf Champions league. This fixture was scheduled to take place on 28 September 2016, but was moved due to Sundowns&rsquo; continental commitments. The Tshwane giants have dominated this fixture with 28 wins while the Free State outfit managed just 13 victories, with 15 matches drawn. Downs edged Celtic 1-0 in this ground last season during the official opening of the refurbish township stadium and did it again. It was the defending league champions&rsquo; first official game without their talisman Keegan Dolly, who joined French League 1 club Montpellier during the transfer window. Downs picked up three points following a 1-0 victory over rookies Baroka FC in their last match before the Christmas recess, while Celtic also ended their year on a high note with a morale boosting 2-1 over Orlando Pirates away from home.
