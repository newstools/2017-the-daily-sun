A 2-0 derby win over Ajax at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday night allowed Cape Town City to go to the top of the league standings.&nbsp;Ajax CT 0 CT City 2Ngoma opens the scoring in the 20th minuteCity doubles their lead through a 41st minute Isaacs own goalPaulse hits the postCity completes a second win over Ajax this seasonMatch SummaryCity looked more cohesive and threatening during the first half and deservedly took a 2-0 lead into the break. The Urban Warriors were improved in the second half, but apart from a Nathan Paulse header which hit the woodwork, never really overly stretched the opposition defence.Full ReportBoth teams started with intent and there were chances at each end, the best early opportunity seeing City defender Tshepo Gumede doing well to block Bantu Mzwikali's goal-bound shot after he had beaten goalkeeper Shu-aib Walters to a long ball.But it was Eric Tinkler's side who were to go in front when Aubrey Ngoma clinically stroked the ball into an empty net after Ajax keeper Jody February had been left stranded after he had rushed off his line to make a block on Lehlohonolo Majoro.The lead was nearly extended on 30 minutes when Ngoma picked out former Ajax winger Manyama at the near post, but February did well to close the angle and make the save.City continued to pose more of a threat going forward and they were 2-0 up five minutes before the interval at a well-attended Cape Town Stadium after Urban Warriors defender Erwin Isaacs could do little more but slide the ball into his own net following Ngoma's killer ball towards Manyama.Ajax started the second stanza with renewed vigour and could have reduced the deficit on 52 minutes had Nathan Pausle's looping header not hit the bar.But it could also have been 3-0 to City if Sibusiso Masina had been more accurate when shooting at an open goal after February had come out to deny Majoro but lost possession.The final 20 minutes of the game went by without too much action as Ajax enjoyed a lot of the ball but failed to find the spark needed to break down a City side determined to deliver on their promises during the build-up to the game this week to do the double over the Urban Warriors.
