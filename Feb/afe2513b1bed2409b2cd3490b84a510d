Every child has the right to education and health. But in order for them to be able to enjoy these rights, the responsibility is on their parents to ensure that they register their birth with the Department of Home Affairs within 30 days of the birth. During Pregnancy Awareness Week, Khululiwe Mabaso, Procter and Gamble&rsquo;s director for corporate communications and government relations for sub-Saharan Africa, said: &ldquo;Having a birth certificate is important to being a citizen of South Africa, at all stages of a person&rsquo;s life.&ldquo;This document is needed to register a child at school, to apply for government grants, to obtain an identity document, and to secure formal employment. &ldquo;Since 2010, Procter and Gamble&rsquo;s Pampers brand have partnered with home affairs to tell parents about why early birth registration is so important for their child&rsquo;s future.&ldquo;We reach about 80% of the mums of newborns annually. &ldquo;Just in government hospitals, we talk to around 600 000 mums on baby care and birth registration every year,&rdquo; said Mabaso. According to the law, parents must register their child at the closest home affairs office within 30 days of their birth. This is free of charge but if their registration is late, parents are required to pay late penalties. To help, home affairs has opened offices in hospitals and health facilities countrywide, for quick birth registrations.Parents who are unsure should speak to the clinic or hospital staff for advice.Registering your child&rsquo;s birth allows them to access to their rights to: - Education and health: Non-registration of a child&rsquo;s birth may impact on their education, as schools will not register a child who does not have a birth certificate. - Family environment: A birth registration makes sure that a child&rsquo;s citizenship, identity and human rights are protected.- Protection against human trafficking and kidnapping: One of the reasons that government is being so strict about the need for birth certificates is to reduce the number of kidnappings and child trafficking incidents.
