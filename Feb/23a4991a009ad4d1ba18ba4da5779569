THE MEC placed the municipality under administration to ensure it served the residents.But the Emadlangeni Municipal Council is having none of it and refuses to listen to anything KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube says.They said they were ready to fight her decision in court.Council members took a stand after Dube-Ncube held an imbizo on Tuesday with angry Utrecht residents, who are against her decision.She visited the area near Newcastle, northern KZN, to explain the decision made on 18 January, following protests on Friday.Dube-Ncube addressed about 3 000 residents at the White City sports ground and said the lack of willingness from some councillors to work under the administrator wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing.&ldquo;We will continue overseeing the municipality until everything goes back to the way it&rsquo;s supposed to be. &ldquo;I call on the council to work with the new administrator whose job is to ensure that the municipality gets back on its feet. We&rsquo;re doing this in the interests of residents, not for our own benefit,&rdquo; said Dube-Ncube.But the residents said the MEC was wasting her time.They said they didn&rsquo;t want an explanation, only for her to reverse her decision.Ntokozo Mnguni (32) said they wanted the MEC to give their council its powers back.&ldquo;The MEC must not come here to fool us. Our council should be allowed to continue with their work. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re confused about why she chose to put the municipality under administration in the first place. &ldquo;Everything was fine,&rdquo; said Ntokozo.Deputy mayor Ntsiki Ndlovu said there wasn&rsquo;t much they could say or do until they met the MEC in court.&ldquo;Council filed an urgent application with the High Court in Pietermaritzburg to object to the MEC&rsquo;s intervention,&rdquo; said Ndlovu.
