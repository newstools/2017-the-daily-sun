A HIGH level meeting between government and stakeholders in the volatile dispute over Vuwani&rsquo;s borders has agreed to allow submissions by those who wish to withdraw the town&rsquo;s inclusion in the new Lim-345 Municipality. The submissions will be made to the Municipal Demarcation Board to ensure it looks into matters raised by residents of Vuwani rejecting the new Lim-345 Municipality.The agreement comes after the meeting was held at Makhado Municipality Hall, Limpopo on Wednesday between the interministerial task team and senior traditional leaders from Vuwani, representatives of the Venda king and the Pro-Makhado task team. The provincial government&rsquo;s intervention followed the violent rejection of the new municipality, which led to several schools in Vuwani being burnt down last year. Phuti Seloba, the provincial government spokesman, said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t be a signatory to the disruption of services in Lim-345. As a result, office keys were handed over to the municipality.&rdquo; Vuwani had been plagued by protests since the announcement by the demarcation board that the area would fall under the new Lim-345 Municipality before the local government elections in August last year.
