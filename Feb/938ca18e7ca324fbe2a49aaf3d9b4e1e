IT WAS a church service dedicated to women&rsquo;s leadership at the Faith Gospel Ministries in Carletonville, Gauteng &ndash; but it was also clearly a launch pad for Dlamini-Zuma&rsquo;s campaign to run for the ANC presidency.Bishop Peter Vuyisile Ndelende set the tone for the campaign. &ldquo;I want a woman to rise up and say I want to be president,&rdquo; said Bishop Ndelende.To which Dlamini-Zuma in her address responded: &ldquo;I heard your message, Bishop, and I agree.&rdquo;Accompanying her were the ANC Women&rsquo;s League leadership, Corporate Governance Minister Des van Rooyen and MKVA chairman Kebby Maphatsoe, all known to be powerful premier league allies.Dlamini-Zuma said women should participate in leadership positions in all spheres of society. She said when women were empowered, the community and the nation benefitted. Women&rsquo;s League president Bathabile Dlamini said even though they have been cautioned by party bosses, they won&rsquo;t stop campaigning for Dlamini-Zuma.She described her as a fearless leader who had changed the lives of many people in the country as well as on the continent. She quelled rumours that Dlamini-Zuma didn&rsquo;t work well with other people, saying she didn&rsquo;t tolerate lazy people.&ldquo;I have spoken to a lot of people who have worked with her, young and old, and they all tell me she is a hard worker.&rdquo;Dlamini-Zuma hit out at corruption, saying it robbed the poor as that money should be directed into resources.&ldquo;But corruption comes in many forms. When you are being paid a salary and not working for it, that&rsquo;s also corruption. People need to work for their salaries.&rdquo;
