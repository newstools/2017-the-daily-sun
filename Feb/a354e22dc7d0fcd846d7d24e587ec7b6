SOUTH African senior netball team coach Norma Plummer is pleased with the progress made by the Proteas. The Proteas have gone from losing by a 25-goal margin to a 16-goal defeat in their last Sanzea Quad Series match played in Durban.They lost Wednesday&rsquo;s match against Australia at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre 62-46.Now Plummer&rsquo;s Proteas will be out to put into practice what they have learned from the Australian Diamonds against New Zealand in their last match of the series in London, England, on Saturday. She reckons consistency and not concentrating on their opponents will help them improve mentally.&ldquo;We got beaten by 55 goals in the past and the last time we played we lost by 25. Now we have it down to 16,&rdquo; said Plummer. Mzansi&rsquo;s lack of a full professional netball league will always have a serious impact on how the Proteas fare against top countries in the world. Although the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League gives players a chance it only runs for eight weekends, which is not long enough, considering how much time top netball countries &ndash; like world champions Australia &ndash; invest in their game. Despite the Proteas&rsquo; less-than-convincing display, Australian coach Lisa Alexander believes Plummer is on the right track.
