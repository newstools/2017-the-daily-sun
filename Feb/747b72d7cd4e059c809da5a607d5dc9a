THE families thought the two 14-year-old girls were on their way to school, but later found out they were allegedly on their way to Durban!Thandeka Zulu and Noxolo Chonco went missing on Thursday after leaving their homes in Madwaleni, KZN.Thandeka&rsquo;s uncle, Thabani Zulu (31) said he only found out that they hadn&rsquo;t been at school when pupils from Madwaleni High School brought the matter to his attention.&ldquo;The pupils told me the two girls were planning on Wednesday to leave for Durban the next day. We don&rsquo;t have any relatives in Durban.&rdquo; He said he went to the local taxi rank, hoping to find the girls, but had no luck. &ldquo;We searched for them the whole day, and went everywhere that we thought they could have been.&rdquo; Thabani said he didn&rsquo;t give them any money, and was sure they didn&rsquo;t have enough cash to get to Durban.&ldquo;But I lost hope when I realised R200 was missing from my bedroom,&rdquo; said Thabani.&ldquo;We tried calling them but their phones were off. I suspect someone has promised them heaven and earth because they have never left home before.&rdquo;Noxolo&rsquo;s gogo, Jabulethiwe Nxumalo (55), said she was worried the girls might have been fooled by someone who promised them a better life.&ldquo;This is devastating. They might be somewhere doing all sorts of wrong things. We pray for their safe return.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said missing person&rsquo;s dockets had been opened and said the cops were still searching for them.
