IT SEEMS that Mzansi is running low on its supply of love potion number nine as Valentine&rsquo;s Day has become less and less popular.According to OnlineCasting, a recent data survey they obtained through Google Trends showed that online searches about Valentine&rsquo;s Day has steadily been on the decrease since 2006.Soon even Mother&rsquo;s Day might prove to be more popular.OnlineCasting said they chose not to look at sales figures, but instead at Google searches for the Valentine&rsquo;s Day, Mother&rsquo;s Day and Father&rsquo;s Day since 2004.When regional factors were bought into play, it appeared that people in Northern Cape still believe in the day of love the most, followed by Free State, KZN and Limpopo.The Western Cape took the dubious honour of being the least romantic province in Mzansi.Kasper Jensen, managing director of OnlineCasting said the analysis showed that even though Valentine&rsquo;s Day was dropping in popularity, it was still more popular than Mother&rsquo;s Day and Father&rsquo;s Day throughout the country.&ldquo;This might have to do with Valentine&rsquo;s Day being more commercialised compared to the others.&rdquo;But he added that Mother&rsquo;s Day had been growing in popularity since 2007 and was now almost as popular as Valentine&rsquo;s Day.Father&rsquo;s Day, on the other hand, has not really increased in popularity since 2010, and has more or less stayed the same.http://www.onlinecasting.co.za/
