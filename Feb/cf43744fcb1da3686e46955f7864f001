ACTOR and radio personality Kini Shandu is earmarked to join Ukhozi FM.That&rsquo;s according to sources close to him, after his sudden move to Joburg.A source said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in talks and negotiating his contract with Ukhozi FM since late last year.&rdquo;Another source said it was strange that Kini would just abruptly leave Durban and his Gagasi FM job without a plan.&ldquo;If he gets all these opportunities, what&rsquo;s wrong with taking them and growing his brand?&rdquo; said the second source.A third source said Kini was in a legal dispute with Gagasi FM after leaving without notice. &ldquo;The last time I checked, the two parties were embroiled in a legal battle. I don&rsquo;t know how it ended.&rdquo;Gagasi FM&rsquo;s Khulekani Shandu said: &ldquo;At this point, there are no new developments, except that from our side the matter is being handled by our attorneys. Kini has expressed a wish to meet with the station to discuss the matter, but so far, that has not happened.&rdquo;SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s in negotiations with Ukhozi FM or not.&rdquo;Kini was not available for comment.
