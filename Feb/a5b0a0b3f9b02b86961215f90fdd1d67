WHEN Daily Sun first reported on Vezulwazi Primary School in January 2015, the kids were learning under a tree after a storm had damaged their classrooms in December 2014.After the story was published, the KZN Department of Education provided four mobile classrooms to the school in April.But on Wednesday, SunPower rejoiced with the pupils and teachers when the department finally handed over renovated classrooms.Principal Alex Madlala of the school in Pomeroy, near Msinga in KZN, thanked Daily Sun for helping them.&ldquo;We are so excited, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be rejoicing if the paper hadn&rsquo;t published the story. &ldquo;We strongly believe the article got the attention of the department, and that&rsquo;s why they responded so quickly,&rdquo; said Madlala. He said the pupils would start using the new classrooms on Monday. Madlala said he had become worried when some parents threatened to send their kids to other schools because of the problem. A teacher said she was happy that they&rsquo;d finally be able to teach without worrying about the weather.Parent Lethiwe Mngomezulu (38) said: &ldquo;At first I wanted to remove my child from this school. But I won&rsquo;t do it now because the classrooms have been fixed.&rdquo; Sihle Mlotshwa, spokesman for the education department, said: &ldquo;The reason it took us this long to fix the classrooms was because the project was put out to tender in March last year, but no responsible service provider could be found.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then the project was put our to tender again and a responsible contractor was appointed. They started working in November last year.&rdquo;
