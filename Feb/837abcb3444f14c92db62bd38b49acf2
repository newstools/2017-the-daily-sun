ACTING national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane told Parliament yesterday he was shocked when he learnt through the media that he was being investigated.&ldquo;I was never told that I was being investigated. The issue went to the media without my being told.&rdquo; About eight corruption allegations were raised against Phahlane by the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union. The allegations include irregularities in awarding contracts and promotion of members without following proper procedures.&ldquo;I do not oversee the awarding of contracts,&rdquo; said Phahlane.He said that all members he had appointed were deserving, and that he had followed the proper procedures. The union also claimed Phahlane was involved in sexual affairs with two of his subordinates, but the top cop denied the allegations. He said he would be taking those who accused him to court next month.Phahlane said private investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan was leading a team of Independent Police Investigative Directorate investigators who had gone to his home. He said that he showed the investigators receipts for a sound system he had allegedly received as a bribe.When police committee chairman Francois Beukman asked Phahlane whether he had had received a bakkie from a business person and if this was in line with the ethics of his position, Phahlane said it wasn&rsquo;t his.He said the vehicle belonged to a dealership and would be returned after 18 months.EFF member Phillip Mhlongo said the manner in which the investigation had been done undermined the security of the country, adding that the committee should not sit and wait for Phahlane to fight the battle alone.Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko agreed with Mhlongo, saying there might be foreign forces wanting to control the police, dating back to colonial times.Phahlane, in his presentation, said since 2009 he had been facing an onslaught meant to destabilise the police, but that he would remain committed to his job.
