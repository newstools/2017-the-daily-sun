BAFANA Bafana will get a fresh start when the new head coach takes over next month.But one of the main priorities facing the SA Football Association will be to bring back the fans and put bums on seats at home matches.Said Safa&rsquo;s technical director, Neil Tovey, yesterday: &ldquo;We have to win back the fans and start filling up our stadiums when we play home matches. &ldquo;The only way we can achieve that is by winning and playing good football.&ldquo;We have to bring back that air of invincibility we had at home.&rdquo;Tovey was the Bafana skipper in the golden years when Mzansi won the Africa Cup of Nations in 1996 and the national team played to full stadiums both at home and in Africa.Said Tovey: &ldquo;If we are to qualify for tournaments it&rsquo;s vital we win our home qualifying matches. By winning at home we will start attracting the fans again.&rdquo;Bafana&rsquo;s busy 2017 schedule kicks off with two friendly matches on 25 and 28 March.Said Tovey: &ldquo;We have not finalised opponents but we should be looking at getting top African sides like Ghana to help us prepare for our opening 2019 Afcon qualifier against Nigeria in June.&rdquo;Tovey said he was not worried by Nigeria, who with Seychelles and Libya make up Group F.He said: &ldquo;We knocked out Nigeria at Afcon two years ago and I reckon they will be more worried by drawing us in the group than we are about them.&rdquo;The 12 group winners and three best runners-up qualify for the finals.Tovey said the new coach would welcome the two friendly matches next month but he stressed that Safa should try and arrange a friendlies against the some of the top guns on the continent in March.Said Tovey: &ldquo;We need to get teams close to Nigeria&rsquo;s strength and Ghana would be ideal. The two friendlies are very important, as it will give the new coach and players a chance to get to know each other.&rdquo;Tovey said the 20 fixtures scheduled for 2017 was not hectic: &ldquo;Players enjoy playing and it&rsquo;s more than manageable.&rdquo;He said the key to Bafana qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia was to win their remaining home matches against Burkina Faso and Cape Verde, and beat Cape Verde away in September. Bafana drew 1-1 away with the Stallions and defeated Senegal 2-1 at home jointly lead Group D with Burkina Faso on four points with four matches remaining.Said Tovey: &ldquo;We are in a decent position to qualify. I reckon 10 or 12 points will see us home and dry.&rdquo;
