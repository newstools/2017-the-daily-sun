Without a league win in their last five outings, Orlando Pirates face a potentially tough Saturday afternoon in Pretoria against high-flying Mamelodi Sundowns.&nbsp;The match at the Loftus Stadium kicks off at 15H30.&nbsp;The Buccaneers go into the game in 10th position on the standings, nine points shy of the summit, while Sundowns are fifth, some six points off leaders SuperSport United, and with a handful of games in hand due to their CAF Champions League and FIFA Club World Cup commitments.In fact, only Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City, with eight wins this season have recorded more than the Brazilians' seven victories in 10 matches.They had to work very hard, however, to scratch out a 1-0 midweek victory against struggling Bloemfontein Celtic.But coach Pitso Mosimane was able to find positives in the way the African champions ground out the result."It wasn't pretty, the main aim was to win the game, I said before the game that this one, we just need to take it [the points], we don't need to play pretty but we've got the experience from the Champions League, we know how to play under stress and pressure."It was tough, we fought, and let's be honest they also had chances to take it but that's football. Football is not about could have, should have, it's about what happened. What happened was we scored one goal, and one goal is three points hey," he said.Pirates' caretaker coach Augusto Palacios has acknowledged Sundowns' potency up front, but says it is his own attack rather than his defence that concerns him."Sundowns are not an easy team. They're a team that enjoy ball possession. [Percy] Tau, [Anthony] Laffor have a good combination, but we have the defence to control that."The only thing to focus on is scoring. Before I was worried about defence and now I need to worry about scoring and finishing. If a player is not scoring you need to have other options," Palacios was quoted saying on&nbsp;KickOff.Palacios will have to make do without goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo and defensive midfielder Issa Sarr after both were hurt during the 0-0 draw with Platinum Stars midweek.Sundowns centre-back Wayne Arendse will miss the game through suspension but otherwise the Tshwane side should have a fully-fit squad.In 30 previous encounters, Pirates have won 12, Sundowns 10, and there have been eight draws.&nbsp;Sundowns won the most recent league encounter against Pirates 2-1, but the Sea Robbers got revenge in the Nedbank Cup with a 2-0 win - both those games played last season.
