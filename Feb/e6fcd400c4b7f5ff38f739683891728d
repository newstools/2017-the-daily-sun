IT was like a scene from a Hollywood movie when residents of Madidi marched to Klipgat Police Station on Friday morning. Gatvol community members got involved in a face-off with the cops.They accused the police of being useless and corrupt.It was a second time in two weeks that the residents had marched to the police station.This was after six community members were arrested for the murder of two suspected thugs.Daily Sun published the story on 24 January, headlined: &ldquo;Beaten and dumped in dam.&rdquo;The residents accuse the police of not taking their complaints seriously.This after they have experienced a spate of house robberies since October last year. Thugs have been going to houses in the area, knocking on people&rsquo;s doors at night and forcing their way in.Once inside they point guns at their victims and steal their valuables.Two weeks ago community members decided that since they knew who the suspects were, they would teach them a lesson.They beat them until they died and then threw their bodies in a dam.Subsequently, six people were arrested for the murder of the two men.But the residents demanded that they should all be arrested, since the entire community was involved. Just when the police called for backup to control the unruly crowd, the residents went crazy.They swore at the officers and even pointed fingers at them, telling them to &ldquo;voetsek&rdquo; because they were useless.Margaret Moobi said that they were tired of the cops.&ldquo;We will not allow this kind of behaviour to continue. If they do not release our people, this area will go up in smoke. We are on fire and we will not back down,&rdquo; she said.Warrant Officer Nelson Mabuza, Klipgat police spokesman, said the arrested residents will appear in court tomorrow for a bail application.
