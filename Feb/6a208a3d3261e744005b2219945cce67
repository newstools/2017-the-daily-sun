LITTLE Uwenzile and Uyihlelile, who were born conjoined, are heading home following a successful operation at Netcare Unitas Hospital in Centurion. The twins were born at 36 weeks at Swaziland&rsquo;s Good Shepherd Hospital in Siteki, on 2 January. They had a combined weight of 4,21kg when they were born by C-section and they were joined at the lower abdomen, but did not share any vital organs.Today they are going home as two separate individuals! The happy teen parents, Mbongeni Sihlongonyane and Bongekile Simelane (both 19), from Big Bend, said they are thankful to the Swazi government for giving the girls a chance to grow up like other kids.Thanks to the Swaziland government&rsquo;s Phalala Fund, the twins were transferred to the Mzansi hospital to undergo a six-hour operation that took a team of eight doctors and a theatre team of 11 nursing professionals, mostly women, to complete.Bongekile said before the surgery she was very emotional.&ldquo;I cried . . . but now I am smiling. I&rsquo;m glad that my children are fine and alive,&rdquo; said the happy mum.She thanked everyone who played a part in making sure their kids survived. Marlene Engelbrecht, the paediatrician who is responsible for the overall care of the twins, said the babies made a rapid recovery and were discharged on Tuesday. Hospital general manager Robert Jordaan said the hospital has been privileged to play a part in helping the beautiful, bright little girls to a happy, healthy future.&ldquo;This has been a significant milestone in the hospital&rsquo;s history, as it was the first separation of conjoined twins undertaken at this hospital.&rdquo;
