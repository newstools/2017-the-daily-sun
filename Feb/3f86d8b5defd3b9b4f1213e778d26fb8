Betito Ebengo is the head stylist at Ors SA and he shared advice about co-washing. What is co-washing&nbsp; Co-washing is different from regular washing in that it provides a one-step method that cleans and conditions hair using only a conditioner. This should not replace regular shampooing, and it is not suitable for women with weak or over-processed hair.&nbsp; A co-wash is recommended as an infrequent method for managing very dry hair. The ideal treatment cycle is one week shampoo, one week co-wash.&nbsp; Although specific co-wash products exist that also clean hair mildly, any conditioner can be used for co-washing.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Ors we recommend you mix your conditioner with lukewarm water to create a diluted co-wash solution,&rdquo; said Betito. For a cleaning effect you can mix 1/3 of your shampoo with 2/3 of your conditioner to create a co-wash solution.Betito&rsquo;s recommended range of Ors products for your hair&nbsp; - Ors Curls Unleashed Sulfate-free Shampoo &ndash; R159,99 - &thinsp;Ors Curls Unleashed Intense Hair Conditioner &ndash; R159,99 - &thinsp;Ors Olive Oil Creamy Aloe Shampoo &ndash; R92,95 - &thinsp;Ors Olive Oil Replenishing Conditioner &ndash; R97,95 Ors has won a number of category awards at the African Hair Awards for two consecutive years! *&thinsp;&thinsp;2015: Best Hair Relaxer &ndash; Ors Olive Oil Built-in Protection No-lye Relaxer *&thinsp;2016: Best Newcomer &ndash; Ors Hair Strengthening Argan Oil Ors has also recently launched a new range of hair and scalp wellness oils. -&thinsp;For more information visit the Ors Facebook page on ORSSouthAfrica -&thinsp;Or follow their Instagram feed on @orshaircare_sa -&thinsp;Or follow @ors_sa on Twitter.&nbsp; Visit their international website for updates, promotions and new products: www.orshaircare.com/ &nbsp;
