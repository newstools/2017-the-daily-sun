ANTHONY Still, the fired City of Joburg member of the mayoral council for infrastructure services, told Daily Sun he is between a rock and a hard place.Still said Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba was taking his frustrations out on him.&ldquo;It is not my duty to get rid of City Power CEO Sicelo Xulu, and I told the mayor that. That&rsquo;s for the board to decide. I told the mayor that if he does this illegally, it will come back to bite him.&rdquo;Still had to provide political leadership to entities such as City Power, Pikitup and Joburg Water.He was replaced by Councillor Nico de Jager, who he took over the reins yesterday. Still added that Mashaba keeps on receiving allegations against Xulu.&ldquo;But these are allegations I have seen before and investigated.&rdquo; Still said he doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with investigating the allegations again.&ldquo;But it has to be done the legal way. Only the board can suspend Xulu,&rdquo; said Still, adding that the board told the mayor the same thing.He was fired on Tuesday, the day after the ANC predicted that he would be fired. The ANC accused the DA-led municipality of getting rid of Still because he told Mashaba to obey the law.ANC Greater Joburg spokesman Jolidee Matongo said Still has been identified as a stumbling block because he does not blindly do what Mashaba orders.Mayoral spokesman Tony Taverna-Turisan said the mayor and Councillor Still differed on how to approach investigations into alleged fraud and corruption within City Power.He said the fact that this investigation makes the ANC so uncomfortable is very telling.Taverna-Turisan told Daily Sun opposition to the dismissal draws a picture of a climate where corrupt officials were allowed to enrich themselves.
