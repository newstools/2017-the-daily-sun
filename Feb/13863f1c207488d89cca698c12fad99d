VALENTINE&rsquo;S DAY is not a good day for Thembeni Mzolo.&nbsp; She thinks about her runaway husband and his prophet lover who are having fun just a few blocks away.&nbsp; AND SHE SITS AT HOME, ALONE AND HEARTBROKEN. Thembeni Mzolo (61), from Emgangeni Village in Umzinto, KZN, said when Simon Mzolo (63) got ill in 2010, she took him to a prophet not far from where they lived.&ldquo;I trusted that prophet with my life,&rdquo; said Thembeni. &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted her with my husband.&ldquo;That was the last time I heard from Simon.&ldquo;That woman stole my husband away.&rdquo;She told that Daily Sun Simon fell in love with the prophet.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that woman used muthi to help steal my husband.&rdquo; Thembeni said watching Simon living with another woman makes her feel dead inside. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know she was a man snatcher.&ldquo;The pain I feel can&rsquo;t be explained. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; She said they have four children and seven grandchildren who all live with her. &ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t even buy them a packet of chips, while buying groceries for the children of this new woman.&rdquo; She said Simon had never given any trouble when it came to other women until now.&ldquo;In our 38 years of marriage he has never been unfaithful.&rdquo; She said the healer is the widow of a local pastor.Simon did not deny that he was dating the prophet, Mama Maduna. &ldquo;My wife fought with me a lot and that is why I have moved away from her. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to divorce her and I don&rsquo;t want to take Mama Maduna as my second wife.&rdquo;He said they are just enjoying each other and said he supports his family financially. Prophet Viona Maduna (59) admitted that she was in a relationship with Simon.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain how we fell for each other but I certainly didn&rsquo;t use muthi.&rdquo; She made it very clear that she was not dependent on Simon for money.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not eating any of his money.&rdquo; And she said she has a registered marriage at Home Affairs and is not planning on marrying a second time.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just having fun,&rdquo; she said.
