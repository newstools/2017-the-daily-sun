Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has praised the role now Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had in his development while they were both at Borussia Dortmund.While both have since left the club, Lewandowski and Klopp were part of a purple patch in Dortmund's history in which the club won two consecutive Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012.The 28-year-old made his name as one of the most deadly strikers in the world under Klopp at BVB and he was quick to praise the German mentor's role in that."He was the one who gave me belief," Lewandowski told the&nbsp;Daily Mail. "In the first three or four months in training, we would have this game - him against the striker. There would be a bet between me and him."In the first few training sessions, he was always winning. After that, not so much. Every time after, he lost. He didn't want to play anymore. It was &euro;50 a game and by the end I had a positive balance. But I saw for the first time with him how important it was [to] train."I saw what I have to do on the pitch when I don't have the ball. You look at Liverpool now and how they play with the pressing. That is what I learned from him."He also improved my finishing. When I came to Dortmund, it wasn't so good. He told me to improve. He showed me what I had to do."
