Dear MizzBEarlier this year I met a woman and we started dating. A week into the relationship we had sex. After a week she told me she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and she went to the clinic. She was told she is pregnant and she says I am the father. Is it possible that I am the father after just having sex once? I am confused. Please help. - ConfusedDear ConfusedIt&rsquo;s possible for a woman to fall pregnant after having unprotected sex or if a condom breaks during sex. Having unprotected sex is putting your life at risk! You exposed yourself to possible HIV and STIs. There is a possibility that this may be your child but if you have doubts you can always have a DNA test done. In the meantime, it is very important to maintain a healthy relationship so that when the child is born, and if it happens to be yours, you are able to maintain the required responsibility to parent the child. Be more responsible and protect yourself and your partner.
