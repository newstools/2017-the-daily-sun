IT takes imagination and just a tiny bit more effort to transform an everyday burger into a hamburger with a twist. I turned to the ancient customs of my Tswana culture and substituted the standard mince patty with skopo meat. Skopo is meat stripped off the cooked head of a sheep or a cow. According to Tswana culture, this delicacy is eaten last during traditional family ceremonies.The men in the family are responsible for cooking it and stripping the meat off the skull. In urban Mzansi, sheep skopo is often sold at taxi ranks and is especially popular with taxi drivers. The recipe below is for two skopo burgers - just increase the ingredients to make more. Surprise your friends this weekend by dishing up a deluxe skopo burger that&rsquo;s easy and cheap to make!INGREDIENTS 250g skopo meatSpices like chicken spice, paprika and garlic salt 1 tablespoon butter1 fresh tomato, sliced 1 onion, sliced (optional) 2 hamburger rollsSlices of cheese, such as cheddar or emmentalDijon mustard Tomato sauce METHOD Dice up the skopo meat into small pieces using a sharp knife.Heat up a non-stick pan over a high heat and melt the butter. When it is bubbling furiously, throw in your spices. Let them cook a few seconds to bring out their flavours before throwing in the diced skopo meat.
