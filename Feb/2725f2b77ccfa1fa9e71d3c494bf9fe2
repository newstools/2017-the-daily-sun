Maritzburg United host Kaizer Chiefs in a Premiership encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday looking to extend their unbeaten run to seven matches.The Team of Choice have enjoyed a good few months since the departure of head coach Ernst Middendorp, who resigned in November, with his stand-in Fadlu Davids taking them to the Christmas break unbeaten in five matches.That run became six when Roger de Sa'ss first match in midweek was drawn away at Polokwane City as they began 2017 solidly - climbing up to seventh in the process.But fourth-placed Amakhosi are also in form at the moment and are starting to find their groove under Steve Komphela. De Sa knows what his side is up against."They started off badly, but they've suddenly turned things around and will come here on a high," he said."I mean Chiefs is Chiefs, they a big club and wherever they go they will be the favourites."But it will be good to host them, bring them into our little change rooms and make them feel a bit shaky. Hoepfully we can do the job as well."Kurt Lentjies and Bevan Fransman are both suspended, with Andrea Filleccia still injured.New Chiefs signing Gustavo Paez is pushing for a first start, but George Lebese is a doubt through injury.
