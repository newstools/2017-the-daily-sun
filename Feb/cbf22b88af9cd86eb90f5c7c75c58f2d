ACTING national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane is unshaken and will continue to do his work, despite the storm surrounding him, he told Parliament today."It has been an onslaught since 2009. It is tiring, but that is not going to make us lose focus on the work that we are doing. We&rsquo;re not shaken and we&rsquo;ll continue to do our work," he told the police portfolio committee.Phahlane, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and Saps leaders were briefing the committee on allegations of fraud and corruption levelled against him.These included an Ipid investigation into the source of the R8 million he paid for his house, and his fleet of cars.Other allegations involved corruption in the police&rsquo;s forensic unit, irregular appointments, sexual relationships with subordinates, and his using state money to pay for a birthday party in 2009.Committee members were taken through a report from CPN Forensic and Accounting Services into allegations that police union Popcru had levelled against Phahlane.Phahlane systematically countered each allegation against him. While he did so, he was flanked by a woman with whom he was once accused of having a sexual relationship, and another who was allegedly employed irregularly.Phahlane said he had not been officially told he was under investigation and had learnt about it through the media.Phahlane detailed how the investigation had come about, and questioned private investigator Paul O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s involvement in the process.He said it was surprising to have a private individual masquerading as a whistleblower, a complainant, and an expert.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/phahlane-unshaken-by-corruption-allegations-20170202
