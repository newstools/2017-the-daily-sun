NELISIWE Mdunge has tried cementing cracks in the walls to prevent her house from falling apart, but nothing seems to help.The 41-year-old unemployed mother of four from C section in Umlazi, south of Durban told Daily Sun that her house has huge cracks inside and out. It has holes in the floor and the roof, and the doors and windows are broken. She said she would appreciate getting an RDP house soon because her house was falling down.&ldquo;I fear the house will collapse while my children and I are asleep.&ldquo;On rainy or windy nights I don&rsquo;t sleep.&ldquo; I stay awake the whole night because I fear the worst. I have heard of many cases where people die in their houses when they collapse. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want that to happen to my family.&rdquo; Nelisiwe said she had informed the ward councillor about the matter.&ldquo;People do not take me seriously and they don&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;All I get is empty promises from the councillor.&rdquo; She said she survived by doing laundry and spring cleaning for her neighbours because the social grant she gets for her children was not enough.Councillor Nomusa Mthembu said she was aware of Nelisiwe&rsquo;s case.&ldquo;She will get her RDP house. &ldquo;We are currently working on it.&ldquo;I assisted her to get her children into school because I understand her situation,&rdquo; said Mthembu.
