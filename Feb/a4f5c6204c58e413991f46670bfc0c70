FAMILY, friends and business owners in Vilakazi Street comforted each other as they remembered the late Khwesi Hudson.A memorial service for Khwesi, who was gunned down at Sakhumzi last weekend, was held at the restaurant on Friday. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba was also there. Khwesi&rsquo;s son, Kojo Hudson, said his father was a sweet man who loved his family and always put them first.&ldquo;My father was a very kind man. He wasn&rsquo;t just a dad to me&sbquo; he was a father to many people and was a very genuine man. If you could talk about a man who would not hurt a fly&sbquo; that was my dad,&rdquo; said Kojo.Archie Tsoku, marketing manager at Sakhumzi, said the tragedy has hit staff hard but that they were coping, with support from friends. &ldquo;We thank all our neighbours along the street who have been checking on us,&rdquo; he said.Archie said old people shouldn&rsquo;t use youngsters to commit crime. &ldquo;The suspects who killed our manager looks young, probably in their 20s. We suspect they were sent by someone to rob the place.&rdquo;Mashaba promised to install CCTV cameras along the famous street.He urged travel agents and tourism agencies to bring more visitors to the area, and called on residents to help fight crime in the area. Meanwhile, cops are still looking for the suspects.
