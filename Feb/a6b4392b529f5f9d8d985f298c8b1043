Nomeva (26) received an invitation to return to the US after an impressive performance on his American debut late last year.The talented fighter from Duncan Village in the Eastern Cape, registered a 10th-round points victory over Juan Garcia Mendez.The former SA champ, who is still unbeaten on 22 outings, said he has drawn lessons from his last American visit and is working harder than before to produce a sensational performance. Nomexa told SunSport: &ldquo;Yes indeed, I&rsquo;m returning to America and I&rsquo;m doubling my efforts to be in a great shape for this contest.&ldquo;I know Menard is a good boxer with a great record and he has been tested.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll go an extra mile to make sure I produce positive results.&ldquo;In my previous visit over there I&rsquo;ve learnt that Americans push very hard and I&rsquo;m motivated to go the extra mile.&rdquo;Despite Menard&rsquo;s knockout ratio, the South African fighter said he doesn&rsquo;t pose much of a threat and has a plan in place for him. &ldquo;I know he has a big right hand. He&rsquo;s not a threat at all. Our team has a plan.&nbsp;&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ve been in the ring with big bangers. &ldquo;So, I know how to take care of myself.&ldquo;In order to be great, one has to fight the best. And at this stage in my career path I don&rsquo;t have to choose opponents,&rdquo; said Nomeva.
