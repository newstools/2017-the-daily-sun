THE record-breaking Egyptian Pharaohs are back to rewrite the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) history books tonight when they meet Burkina Faso in the first semifinal at the Stade de l&rsquo;Amitie in Libreville, Gabon.The Egyptians remain the only side to have won the continental showpiece seven times &ndash; in 1957, 1959, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2008 and 2010. The best Burkina Faso could do has been runners-up position in 2013.Now the Pharaohs are gunning for their eighth title.But African football has undergone a transformation and the outcome of matches is no longer easy to predict. Punters are finding it hard to guess who will romp home victorious at the end of the 90 minutes tonight. If bookmakers are to be guided by statistics, they will have to go with the Stallions, who have scored six goals in four matches and conceded only two, while the north Africans have scored fewer goals &ndash; three in four matches, which is a questionable record.The Stallions are in this semifinal following a solid 2-0 victory over Tunisia, where substitute Aristide Bance took charge by opening their scoring and assisting Prejuce Nakoulma in wrapping up the match.This is Burkina Faso&rsquo;s third semifinal appearance after first reaching this stage in 1998 as hosts.Egypt and the Stallions will be renewing their 2000 Afcon group stages rivalry, where the Pharoahs won 4-2 following goals by Ahmed Salah Hosny, Hany Ramzy, Abdel Halim Ali and an Ahmed Hassan penalty.The BBC reported yesterday that Egypt could be minus their Arsenal midfielder, Mohamed Elneny, who will most probably not recover from injury in time to face Burkina Faso.The 24-year-old is still nursing a calf problem that kept him out Sunday&rsquo;s 1-0 quarterfinal win over Morocco.&ldquo;Elneny has a bad calf strain. We will send a medical report to his club,&rdquo; coach Hector Cuper told the BBC. In his absence Cuper will pin his hopes on Mohamed Salah.&ldquo;He will have tests and we hope that if we manage to reach the final he will be able to return.&rdquo;It would be a remarkable return for the Pharaohs, who are at the finals for first time since that success seven years ago. But they were perhaps fortunate to get past Morocco, who missed a host of good chances as Egypt claimed victory with an 87th-minute winner by Abdel-Moneim. Malang Diedhiou of Senegal will officiate this important tie.Meanwhile, Ghana&rsquo;s Black Stars are also in a race against time to have Asamoah Gyan ready for tomorrow&rsquo;s second semifinal against Cameroon at the Stade de Franceville.
