THERE is a shortage of teachers in KZN.This is according to the South African Democratic Teachers Union, who said this at Sadtu House in Durban yesterday.Nomarashiya Caluza, the union&rsquo;s provincial secretary, said they have reports of schools which do not have enough teachers, including those who teach important subjects such as mathematics, physical science and accounting. Caluza said: &ldquo;The main cause of this problem is the education department&rsquo;s annual redistribution of teachers.&ldquo;Over 2 800 teachers are affected by the redistribution. &ldquo;The department moves them from the schools they work for when their contracts expire. &ldquo;Sometimes they are moved when the enrolment rate at the school decreases.&ldquo;But when the enrolment rate at the school increases the following year, the school then has too few teachers and more pupils.&ldquo;Another problem is that teachers are often moved to schools far from where they live.&ldquo;They are then forced to move from their homes, which also affects their families.&ldquo;One teacher struggled to find a school for her child and accommodation for her family when she was moved from Umkhanyakude district to the Umgungundlovu district.&rdquo; She added that the union wants the department to give teachers a list of schools to choose from instead of just assigning them to a certain school.KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department held a meeting with the unions regarding the issues on Wednesday.&ldquo;The education MEC was briefed about some of the issues that were discussed during the meeting. &ldquo;The department is taking measures to address the union&rsquo;s grievances.&rdquo;
