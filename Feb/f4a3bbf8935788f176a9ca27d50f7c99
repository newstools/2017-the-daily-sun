WHEN police heard that members of two gangs had promised to kill each other wherever they met, they tried to make sure they had things under control.However, a member of one of the groups was shot and killed last Saturday, and buried on Sunday.Members of the rival gang promised to finish off the remaining members at his funeral.The police were sent in large numbers to Winterveld Cemetery, outside Mabopane in Tshwane, to prevent a fight.But it was too late. While the police were busy guarding the mourners, another man had already been killed.His body was discovered on Sunday morning.Mike Chauke (24) was shot in the early hours of the day, not far from where Frans Kanye was being buried.He was allegedly shot 15 times and thrown in a nearby yard.The owner of the house where his body was found said he was awakened by gun shots that morning but he was too scared to go outside to check what was going on.&ldquo;I wanted to help, but I didn&rsquo;t want to be killed as well.&rdquo; He said he waited until the police and neighbours came to the scene.Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said: &ldquo;A case of murder was opened and no arrests have been made, but investigations are continuing.&rdquo;
