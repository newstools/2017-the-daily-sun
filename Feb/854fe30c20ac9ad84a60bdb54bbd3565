TENSION is mounting in Tshwane as thousands of residents plan to march against illegal immigrants today. This comes after violence against foreigners flared up in Rosettenville, Joburg and Pretoria West recently, which some have blamed on comments made by Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. During his state of the province address this week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura even called on leaders to handle issues around migrants with sensitivity and care. However, Mashaba has denied that he is to blame for the violence. He said he was deeply concerned to hear about attacks on foreigners and the planned protest. His spokesman, Tony Taverna-Turisan, told Daily Sun it was unfortunate that the mayor&rsquo;s comments were misinterpreted.&ldquo;The mayor&rsquo;s comments have in no way been xenophobic and he has on numerous occasions stated that he welcomes foreigners. Foreigners buy goods in our country, start businesses and stimulate economic growth,&rdquo; he said. Taverna-Turisan said Mashaba&rsquo;s comments were made while he was discussing plans to revitalise the inner city and take it back from criminal elements, as it was officially reported in October that the inner city was the most dangerous area of Joburg. Isaac Mahamba, senior superintendent of the Tshwane Metro Police, confirmed that permission for the march was granted. The Tshwane mayor&rsquo;s spokesman, Sam Mgobozi, declined to comment.
