Zinhle&rsquo;s boyfriend, Mazwi Malinga (32), was one of seven people who had been shot. Mazwi&rsquo;s sister, Lindiwe Malinga (23) said Zinhle took the news badly. &ldquo;Zinhle fell down and collapsed. We rushed her to hospital where she later died,&rdquo; said Lindiwe. Lindiwe said she heard from neighbours the seven friends were in 33-year-old Philani Mkhungo&rsquo;s shack in K section, Umlazi, KZN when they were attacked by three gunmen who entered the shack and started shooting. Mazwi and Philani died on Sunday while the five other friends are in a critical condition in hospital.
