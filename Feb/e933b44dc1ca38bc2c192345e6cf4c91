Bidvest Wits must overcome last weekend&rsquo;s preliminary round 2-1 first leg defeat away to Saint-Lousienne if they are to keep their CAF Champions League campaign alive.The second-leg showdown takes place at the Bidvest Stadium on Saturday evening at 18H00 South African time.The Clever Boys began well enough in the first leg in Reunion last Saturday, with Gabadingo Mhango's 37th minute strike giving Gavin Hunt's side a 1-0 lead at the break at the Stade Theophile Hoarau.But the islanders hit back with a goal midway through the second half and clinched victory with a 90th minute penalty.Mhango's away goal though could prove crucial and means that the Clever Boys can advance to the first round of the competition, where they would meet Egyptian giants Al Ahly, with a 1-0 win in Johannesburg this weekend.Despite being used mainly off the bench this season, Mhango has been in sparkling form, and from a rare start he netted both goals in Wits' 2-1 midweek victory in the league over Orlando Pirates. The brace took his tally in the league to seven.And with additional firepower in the team such as Phakamani Mahlambi, James Keene, Elias Pelembe and Daine Klate, it would be a real shock if Hunt's side do not make it through to the next round.Always a perfectionist, Hunt was, however, not entirely satisfied with the performance on Wednesday night."If you look at our season so far our passing in the final third has really let us down especially in the first-half there were a couple of times Phakamani went through and Mhango, and if the final ball [had been better] we could have got on the end of it and had a better result. It's been a problem for us but these things we work on every day," he said.However, the Clever Boys boss was pleased to see his men showing character."We're trying to get a squad of players together and work hard for each other," he said. "That's what we're about, we don't have the individual quality and they know that but we have to work together and in the second-half we dug in and got a result."Hunt has a fully fit squad available and last week in Reunion gave a run out to some players who have not had much domestic action, while still fielding a strong an experienced team.
