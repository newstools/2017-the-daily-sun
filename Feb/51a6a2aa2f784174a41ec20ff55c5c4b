SALAMINA Mosese is a modern woman who has to balance the pressures of a successful career with being a mum and wife. Besides being an actress and co-founder of AzaTV, Salamina is married to actor Tshepo &ldquo;Howza&rdquo; Mosese. The two have a daughter who has just started school.Salamina shared some tips with Daily Sun on finding a balance between work and family time.&ldquo;I think family time is extremely important.&ldquo;You need to be deliberate about it because, as people who run their own businesses will tell you, you never switch off. My business follows me everywhere I go, so I have to deliberately draw the line between work and personal time.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t attend meetings or events on Sundays because if I don&rsquo;t do that, I realise I&rsquo;m missing out on life with my daughter and my husband. &ldquo;Sometimes I realise we haven&rsquo;t talked and had fun together for a while.&ldquo;I try to switch off from work mode when I get home, but that takes practice.&rdquo;Salamina said those in the entertainment industry are spoilt by stylists who take care of their hair and nails. &ldquo;But sometimes taking care of those things herself is just the relaxation she needs.&ldquo;Women need some time alone. Sometimes I just do my nails or ask someone to do my hair so I can switch off for a bit!&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a passionate reader, so I like to read when I&rsquo;m having my nails done.&rdquo;She&rsquo;s very clear, though, that there&rsquo;s a time and a place to go all out and look glamorous.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear makeup to the office. &ldquo;I only wear it when I have a shoot or an important meeting&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just me. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a decision every woman makes for herself.&rdquo;
