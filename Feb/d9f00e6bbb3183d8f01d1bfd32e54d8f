ORLANDO Pirates are still searching for their first win of 2017 after playing 1-1 in an Absa Premeirship match against Polokwane City at Orlando Stadium on Saturday.New Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret went straight into battle after he was introduced as the mentor on Monday.Things are not looking good for Pirates. They have gone 10 games without a win. The last time they tasted a win was against Free State Stars last year November with a margin of 1-0. Bucs have 20 points from 17 games and they sit at 10th place on the table while City maintained their sixth position with 24 points from 18 games. The first half started on a slow pace with both sides creating half chances which couldn&rsquo;t worry City&rsquo;s goalkeeper George Chigova and Bucs keeper Brighton Mhlongo. However, the second half saw some few goal scoring chances being created by the visiting side and they finally broke the ice through Rodney Ramagalela. With the game starting to open, Pirates managed to level the matters through Dove Wome&rsquo;s goal. It was Wome&rsquo;s second goal since he joined Pirates from SuperSport United during the January transfer. Wome had another opportunity to bang a brace for his side but failing to control the ball saw his chance go over the bar.&nbsp;
