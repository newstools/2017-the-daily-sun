RUNAWAY English Premiership leaders Chelsea will be hoping to consolidate their lead at the top of the log.This when they visit Burnley at Turfmor Stadium today (3.30pm).The Blues will be searching for their 20th Premiership victory of the season as they look to break the 60-point mark after 25 games.Antonio Conte&rsquo;s men top the log with 59 points from 24 games. Burnley are 12th on the log table, with 29 points from 24 games.After their big 3-1 victory over fellow title contenders Arsenal last week, the Blues are the overwhelming favourites to clinch the title.The Blues thumped the newly promoted outfit 3-0 in London last August at Stamford Bridge.Victor Moses and Eden Hazard were among goal scorers as they strolled to an easy win.More of the same performance will be expected at Turfmor as the in-form Blues continue their march to the league title.The Blues won five of their last six games in all competitions, dropping just two points in their 1-1 draw with title contenders Liverpool at Anfield in a league match.The rookies registered four wins and lost two matches in their last six matches, including a 1-0 victory at home against champions Leicester City.Chelsea have lost just three games this season, but will be severely tested against a team that has an impressive home record.Burnley star, Michael Keane, says his unfancied side have the potential to stun the Blues.Said Keane: &ldquo;It will be tough, but when we&rsquo;re at home in front of our own fans we have that belief we can beat anyone.&rdquo;
