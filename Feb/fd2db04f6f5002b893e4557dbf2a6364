THEY should be in class preparing for a bright future.But while their parents think they&rsquo;re at school, they are absent.The SunTeam yesterday saw two schoolboys in the veld at zone 4, Ga-Rankuwa, north of Pretoria preparing to get high at 8am! One was in school uniform with brown Adidas takkies and a Nike cap, while his friend was not in uniform. They were sitting face to face on top of big rocks and talking as if they owned the place, both busy rolling a zol with cigarette papers.The SunTeam spotted them and decided to investigate.They were shocked when they saw the car stopping near them.Even when the SunSnapper, still inside the car, took out his camera to take a photo of them, they looked at him as if they were posing. But as soon as he got out of the car, the boy in uniform grabbed his bag and they both ran off.They left behind their rolled dagga mixed with a white powder as well as half an apple juice.Nearby residents said they&rsquo;re worried about drug addicts in the area, saying a few houses have been broken into during daytime.Resident Amelia Maphakela (46) said: &ldquo;The thieves take only small items that can easily be carried. I am on my guard against break-ins.&rdquo;
