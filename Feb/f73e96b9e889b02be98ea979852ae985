BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic is on the edge of relegation, and boy, pressure is mounting!&nbsp; This as the Free State outfit&rsquo;s season is taking a nosedive straight into National First Division (NFD) territory. Co-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka are on the edge of their seats, desperately trying anything to save the ship from sinking. And the pressure cooker is on the verge of bursting, as Siwelele Sa Masele is in danger of losing three successive Absa Premiership matches. Celtic are a mere two points above the relegation zone. The club occupies the 13th spot, with 15 points from 16 games. And things can only take a turn for the worst, if the side go down to Chippa United in a must-win game at the Dr Molemela Stadium today (3.30pm). Seema, who has blamed Lady Luck for Celtic&rsquo;s two loses to Mamelodi Sundowns and Golden Arrows, says his team is firing blanks. He said Siwelele needed to find the back of the net, if they want to turn the corner. Seema said he was banking on the upcoming back-to-back home matches against Chippa and Platinum Stars. He said: &ldquo;We desperately need to score goals. It&rsquo;s pressure time and we need to find the back of the net. &ldquo;Losing the game against Chippa is not an option.&rdquo; Even though the team was displaying character in matches, Seema added that they were faltering in the final third of the field. Seema told SunSport: &ldquo;Defence is not a problem, it&rsquo;s the front line that&rsquo;s giving us a big headache. &ldquo;We need to convert our chances and score goals, so we can win matches.&rdquo; Seema and Maduka are desparate to produce results. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a student of the game and continue to learn. &ldquo;We have no mandate, but relegation is not on the cards,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our main objective is to steer the team to safety. Hopefully, we will be able to inspire our players to bounce back to their winning ways.&rdquo;
