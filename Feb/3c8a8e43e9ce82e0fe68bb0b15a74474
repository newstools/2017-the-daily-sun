The march, which also included community members, started at Daku Road.The crowd sang struggle songs and carried placards which read: &ldquo;We are tired of crime&rdquo; and &ldquo;Enough is enough.&rdquo; Zalisile Bikani of the association said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not here to do the cops&rsquo; work. We&rsquo;re concerned with the escalating crime in our kasi. Ambulances can&rsquo;t access this area and even the police are under attack by criminals. We can&rsquo;t just sit back as if nothing is happening.&ldquo;Police officers who work with criminals must also know that their time is over. We are going to name and shame them.&rdquo; Nombulele Bangani (48), a New Brighton resident, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel safe in my own house because of the break-ins and criminal activities that happen every night in our kasi.&rdquo;Brigadier Philip Salukazana, the Motherwell cluster commander, said: &ldquo;We will read and deal with the petition. We thank the association for this initiative which has made us aware of the criminal activities happening in their communities. We hope they will continue to work with us to fight crime.&rdquo;
