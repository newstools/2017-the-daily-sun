PARENTS and teachers at this Eastern Cape school are living in fear. And it&rsquo;s not thugs they&rsquo;re worried about &ndash; but pupils who have turned into gangsters!Of the 1 225 pupils at Nkululeko Secondary School in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage, several kids allegedly secretly belong to notorious gangs such as the Ugly Boys, Gaza, Izikhotane and Ntswembu Rush.This week alone, more than 10 pupils aged between 13 and 18 were suspended after being involved in gang related incidents.The school&rsquo;s safety patrol officer, Andile Divine (53), said whenever he asks gangster pupils why they&rsquo;re late for school, they simply walk off and go and sit on the tombstones in a nearby graveyard! &ldquo;We try our level best to instil discipline among them but these pupils go astray every day.&rdquo; Divine said that pupils from other schools contributed to the chaos, especially after school on Fridays.&ldquo;They arrive by taxi and burn clothes and money and boast about how much richer they are than pupils at this school.&ldquo;Bucwa is a busy street but these boys bring it to a standstill when they go crazy.&ldquo;We sat in a meeting with parents recently and many pupils were suspended for five days. Parents had to explain why their kids&rsquo; behaviour was deteriorating so badly.&ldquo;The principal also exposed gangsters by calling them up in front of other pupils at the assembly lines.&rdquo;Divine said if teachers caught gang members carrying knives, those pupils would be disciplined. &ldquo;But then they threaten the teacher outside school. &ldquo;They search for their addresses and walk past their homes singing.&rdquo;Provincial department of education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said izikhothane was a societal issue and that the outfits the pupils bragged about were not allowed at schools.
