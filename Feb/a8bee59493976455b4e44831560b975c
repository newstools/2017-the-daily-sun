Bidvest Wits forward James Keene has hailed his combination with Phakamani Mahlambi and says he is willing to do the dirty work in order for him to succeed.The attacking-duo were back to their best in the midweek 5-0 drubbing of Ajax Cape Town, netting a goal apiece with Mahlambi subsequently bagging the man-of-the-match award."Phakamani and I complement each other very well. I'll do his dirty work and he can carry on and score the goals," Keene told the club's website."He's hard to defend against and he's going to be a very good player."He's a raw talent and the coach handles him very well. Gavin understands Phakamani and he lets him to his thing."I just stand and do the dirty work because not many people are going to catch him. He's that fast. When he's running down the wing&sbquo; I struggle to get to the box with him but he's a fantastic player," he concluded.
