ABOUT 120 residents from Jacobs Hostel, on the Bluff in the south of Durban, have been patiently waiting since last year for new flats in the hostel.But their hopes of occupying the flats this month may come to nothing.This comes after a commotion on Sunday, when a chaotic group from the hostel disrupted the allocation process. The group allegedly forced beneficiaries out of the queue and hurled insults at them as they demanded to be included in the list.One of the residents, Mkhiwa Magubane (44), said the protesters only wanted to spoil things for people who were really in need.&ldquo;They have their own houses and it really doesn&rsquo;t make sense that they demand to be included in the list. &ldquo;If they had a problem with the list, they should sort it out with eThekwini Municipality,&rdquo; he said.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops were monitoring the situation.&ldquo;The residents are in a meeting to resolve the matter. No case has been opened at this stage,&rdquo; Zwane said.eThekwini&rsquo;s spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the relevant city officials would investigate.
