THE flats were built more than 10 years ago.They were beautiful and complete. But no one was ever allowed to move in. Those who tried to invade them illegally, were quickly removed.There are vacant flats in parts of Soweto like Mzimhlophe and Dube.Daily Sun paid a visit to the flats behind Mzimhlophe Hostel over the weekend. They were in a terrible state. The doors and windows have been stripped and in some of the flats, water is leaking.Electricity boxes have been vandalised and the grass is so tall that it hides some of the ground floor units. Residents told the SunTeam it was sad to see the flats being destroyed right in front of them.&ldquo;When the flats were built, we were told they were for us but none of us has been offered one,&rdquo; said Sthembiso Mkhize (40).City of Joburg spokesman Nthatisi Modingoane said that there is a process underway to repair the flats. This will allow for a handover to the Johannesburg Social Housing Company to allocate and manage the units.&ldquo;The delay in allocating these flats has been purely based on the fact that people do not want the rental option. &ldquo;They want RDP houses,&rdquo; said Modingoane.
