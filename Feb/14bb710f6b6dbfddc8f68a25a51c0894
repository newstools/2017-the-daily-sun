TWO women were sitting in their car enjoying the drive, although it was raining, with no idea of the nightmare around the corner. Then the Ford Figo suddenly fell into a ditch full of water on First Street in Mahikeng, North West on Tuesday! They screamed for help as they stared death in the eye. The car was sinking deeper into the water.Bystander Keith Sauls said: &ldquo;I jumped into the ditch and helped the driver, and soon my colleague also came to assist. We helped the driver and passenger to escape through the windows of the car.&rdquo; Wesley Dumont, who owns a business nearby, said the rain had made it impossible to get to the premises because the road had been flooded. &ldquo;We hope the municipality will do something about the rain damage.&rdquo; North West Community Safety and Transport MEC Mpho Motlhabane urged motorists to be careful as the province was affected by heavy rain. &ldquo;I appeal to motorists to be patient when they reach areas where there is water on the road. We are currently experiencing heavy rain and it&rsquo;s important for drivers to share the road wisely. &ldquo;Lower your speed and give others space on the road.&rdquo; The two women were taken to hospital to be treated for shock.
