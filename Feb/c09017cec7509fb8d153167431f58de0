A TOTAL of 63 people have been bust at three supermarkets in Tshwane for allegedly employing undocumented foreigners.The arrests come hot on the heels of attacks on foreigners in Rosettenville, Joburg and Pretoria West after residents accused them of dealing in drugs.Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba yesterday condemned the attacks and urged residents not to take the law into their hands. He said 19 women and 28 men were arrested at Montana Spar, while the manager was also charged. Another six women and nine men were arrested at Zambezi and Doornpoort Spar stores. Gigaba said he would meet with the stores&rsquo; management concerning the matter.Gigaba said he had visited the areas where foreigners were attacked. &ldquo;Residents told me that they were not targeting foreigners, but criminals,&rdquo; said Gigaba. He said the residents told him they would have done the same to South Africans. Gigaba said residents told him that only six houses were targeted, because the occupants of the houses were dealing in drugs and allowing prostitution. Gigaba added he was aware of the protest against foreign nationals expected to take place today, and that he has spoken to the leaders of the protest.
