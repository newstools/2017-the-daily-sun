MPEPHOSE High School in Umfolozi, northern KZN remained closed yesterday while negotiations to find a solution to the trouble there continued.Fuming parents were again out in the streets, turning away pupils on their way to school.The drama started on Tuesday when a group of about 200 residents, who presented themselves as parents, stormed the school and ordered pupils out of their classrooms.Following the chaos, the principal and her staff were escorted to safety. Sihle Mlotshwa, KZN Department of Education spokesman, said officials from the Uthungulu district were working tirelessly to get the situation back to normal.The protesting parents are demanding the removal of the newly appointed principal. She started in December after the previous principal died in February last year.SGB member Nicholas Shelembe (52), who confirmed that the school was still closed yesterday, said some residents wanted the job to be given to a local teacher.But protester Canaan Ngcobo (47), told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;We are angered by her arrogance towards us as parents and her failure to manage the school. The school is chaotic. Our children are repeating classes, while others skip class as they please yet she keeps quiet. When we request a meeting to discuss our issues, she refuses and insults us.&rdquo; Canaan warned that the principal&rsquo;s safety could not be guaranteed.&ldquo;The department should place her somewhere else and bring us a capable principal who is willing to work with us,&rdquo; he said. The SunTeam contacted the principal but she only said she was busy in a meeting and dropped the phone.
