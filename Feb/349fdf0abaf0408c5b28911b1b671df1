ANAKO should have known better!&nbsp; Buying his two sugar mammas identical red panties ended up in a public fight for all the villagers to see.&nbsp; Anako Faleni (18) of Nkontyweni Village, Mthatha is dating two sugar mammas in the village.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think they would find out I&rsquo;d bought them the same gift.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he loves them both. The one sells magwinya, the other sells fruit.&nbsp; But things went wrong when one boasted to the other that she got red-hot underwear from her Ben 10.&nbsp; Soon hot klaps started flying and the two women were rolling on the ground, pulling hair and throwing punches.&nbsp; NomaJapan Ngqunge (41) said she wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of their fight.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love Anako. I give him free magwinya and he is good in bed. This fight will continue until he chooses the woman he loves the most.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nozintombi Mthombo (38) doesn&rsquo;t believe Anako bought them the same gift.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced NomaJapan bought herself the panties so I&rsquo;d fight with Anako.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she doesn&rsquo;t back off, my okapi will dance a gwara-gwara inside her punani,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; No police case was opened but community leader Joseph Mkhondo said they will call an imbizo.&nbsp; Nozintombi said a sangoma told her to dress a goat in the red panties to get her Ben 10 to dump NomaJapan.
