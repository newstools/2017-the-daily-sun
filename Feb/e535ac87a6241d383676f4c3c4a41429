THERE&rsquo;s a new law enforcer in Braamfischerville, Soweto.While Metro cops and police flash blue lights and switch on sirens, these guys drive around in their car and dish out punishment.They only target drunk pedestrians, many of whom have now tasted the painful medicine of the Sjambok Squad!People who have seen the squad in action told Daily Sun two men patrol the streets in a black Toyota &nbsp;Avanza.&ldquo;Once they notice a drunkard who causes trouble for motorists, they park and sjambok the hell out of that person,&rdquo; said Manqoba Sithole (42).He praised the sjambok punishment, saying drunk people in the kasi have no respect for cars.&ldquo;These people won&rsquo;t move out of the way for a car. &ldquo;Whether you hoot or flick the lights, they just walk at their own pace,&rdquo; said Manqoba.He said drivers have to stop and let drunk pedestrians pass before they can move again.&ldquo;As a driver you have to stop because if you bump a pedestrian, the residents don&rsquo;t ask questions &ndash; they just beat the driver.&rdquo; Another commuter from Meadowlands, Thokozani Ndaba (30), blamed drunks for the kasi&rsquo;s many accidents.&ldquo;Put a cow here and they will run, but they won&rsquo;t get out of the way of a car that might kill them,&rdquo; he said.One of the victims, Lucky Sibisi (26), said he learnt the hard way and will never get drunk and walk on the street again.&ldquo;I was walking down the street on Saturday and didn&rsquo;t see any cars coming. &ldquo;The next moment two men were sjambokking me like never before.&rdquo; He said he threw his bottle of beer away and ran for his life. Many motorists whom Daily Sun spoke to said the Sjambok Sqaud is doing a great job and should continue.&ldquo;They should open branches all over. We are tired of the unruly drunks,&rdquo; said one motorist.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said it is not right for people to beat up others. He advised pedestrians to obey the rules of the road.
