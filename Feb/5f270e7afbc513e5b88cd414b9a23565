WHEN the Nyanga family heard that they would receive a newly built RDP, they immediately prepared umqombothi to thank their ancestors.Their ward councillor soon arrived with a contractor who put down a concrete slab as a foundation, but then nothing happened. And seven years later, the family of two pensioners and their 10 kids remain trapped in their two-room mud house.Madala Silulami Nyanga (72) and his wife Nolindile (60) of Ntlekiseni Village, Mthatha, said their long wait for a house has been torture.&ldquo;After they put a slab in front of our two-room mud house in 2010, they left a wheelbarrow and a spade behind and told us that building would start the next day. That never happened. Meanwhile our mud house has been by ruined by heavy rain, leaving us to share one room with our 10 kids,&rdquo; said Silulami, adding that there was no privacy in the house.Nolindile said: &ldquo;My kids are all adults but none of them are working. The house issue breaks my heart, but I feel helpless.&rdquo; Councillor Lindikhaya Mkhonto said it was Human Settlements MEC Helen Sauls-August who identified the Nyanga family during a special intervention.Provincial human settlements department spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha said he couldn&rsquo;t confirm if the family was on the database or not.&ldquo;Between 2010 and now, the department has appointed different contractors for different projects. &ldquo;A thorough investigation into our RDP database will reveal which contractor was awarded the tender for the Nyanga family house and why it is unfinished,&rdquo; he said.
