TV PRODUCER Thokozani Nkosi and his wife Bonolo have expanded their family!&nbsp;The couple welcomed an additional member in their family when they were blessed with a baby daughter.&nbsp;This is the couple&rsquo;s second child together after their first born Kholiwe, who is in primary school.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Nkosis are good people and we&rsquo;re happy their family is growing.&nbsp;&ldquo;They deserve all God&rsquo;s grace and happiness headed their way and we hope their new daughter, Owakhe, brings them more joy,&rdquo; said a friend.&nbsp;Another family friend said the couple, who has been married for years, is a perfect example that settling down early doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t go on to achieve your dreams.&nbsp;&ldquo;They continue to lead their lives as individual brands and work as a couple and business partners.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a good thing to watch because young people tend to regard marriage as some kind of imprisonment,&rdquo; said the friend.&nbsp;Thokozani started off in the entertainment industry as a TV presenter and went on to establish the highly successful Tox Media, which produces It&rsquo;s Gospel Time, Crux, and Big Up.&nbsp;Recently, Bonolo presented Behind The Gospel on eKasi+ and is also a radio presenter.&nbsp;When called for comment, Thokozani, who was talking on behalf of the couple, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited as parents and we hope for the best for her life. Our first born daughter is also happy and is taking her big sister role seriously.&rdquo;&nbsp;
