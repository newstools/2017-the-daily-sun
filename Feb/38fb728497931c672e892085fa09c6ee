PHUMELELE Hlela happily stood in the queue with her ID in hand to renew her licence.But things went sour when an official told her she shares her ID number with a man. Phumelele (34), from Meadowlands, Soweto said despite what Home Affairs says, she is not a man. &ldquo;After the official told me I shared my ID number with a man, I was instructed to go to Home Affairs to have it fixed.&rdquo; Home Affairs instructed her to bring a clinic card proving where she was born and a letter of proof from the school she attended. They also said her mum should come to Home Affairs to confirm Phumelele was born in Mzansi.&ldquo;I did everything they said, but nothing was done to solve my problem. &ldquo;I then decided to go see the man I shared my ID with.&ldquo;But he accused me of stealing his ID. &ldquo;He called the police and I was forced to sleep in prison for a weekend. My life has come to a complete standstill. &ldquo;Things can&rsquo;t go on like this.&rdquo; Daily Sun contacted Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola. He promised to refer the matter to the provincial manager, who will contact Phumelele to solve the matter.
