There is a great need for awareness and safety for those who share needles to inject drugs directly into their bodies.Shaun Shelly, national policy, advocacy and human rights manager for TB and HIV Care, an organisation working to prevent, find and treat TB and HIV in communities, said there are about 67 000 injecting drug users in Mzansi.Shelly, who is also a researcher in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Pretoria, said those who inject drugs are 28 times more likely to have HIV than the general population, according to a 2014 UNAids report. In Mzansi, HIV prevalence is lower among drug users, but will be a problem if not addressed, as 5% to 10% of new HIV infections worldwide are due to needle sharing, said UNAids&rsquo; 2013 report.Shelly said more information had to be shared on this after a University of Pretoria (UP) social worker and two members of OUT &ndash; an organisation dedicated to building healthy and empowered lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities &ndash; were arrested in Tshwane for distributing sterile water to drug users who inject drugs. The project, run by OUT Wellbeing, is supported by the Department of Health and UP. The Step Up Project includes handing out sterile injecting equipment in packs with water, gauze, alcohol swabs and the like; behaviour change interventions, support services, a drop-in centre and clinic, referrals to hospitals, information and information on antiretrovirals, HIV and hepatitis C testing, wound care and more.Research has shown that needle and syringe programmes reduce sharing of needles and unsafe injecting practices by up to 60%, decrease HIV transmission by 33% to 42%, are cost-effective and do not increase frequency of injecting or drug use.
