THE deaths of the Life Esidimeni psychiatric patients will not be swept under the carpet.&ldquo;There will have to be court cases where the NPA will decide who to prosecute or not to prosecute,&rdquo; said Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. Motsoaledi was being grilled in parliament on the issue of the over 100 psychiatric patients who died in Gauteng.&ldquo;There will be an inquest for each and every death which will be conducted by a magistrate. We take the deaths seriously, and also want justice not only to prevail but also to be done.&rdquo; It has been reported that the transfer of the patients from public health facilities to NGOs was a cost cutting measure.&ldquo;At no stage did it emerge that the departement nationally or in any province had run out of money to take care of the patients.&rdquo;Motsoaledi said Gauteng Premier David Makhura assured him that the issue of NGOs was never raised until September, when the former MEC Qedani Mahlangu made an announcement in the provincial legislature about the 36 dead patients. The Life Esidimeni Family Committee said in a statement: &ldquo;As families, we stand together to say to political parties and opportunistic lawyers &ndash; let us grieve.&rdquo;
