THE death toll of mentally ill patients who were transferred from Life Esidimeni to 27 NGOs is now probably above 100.Health ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba told the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Health yesterday that it was quite clear to him that 94 deaths would not be the end.&ldquo;We are still collecting more data coming in of deaths. &ldquo;I am quite confident that the figure is now above 100 as we speak,&rdquo; Makgoba said. Makgoba painted a bleak picture of the 27 NGOs to which the patients had been transferred. &ldquo;All of them were underresourced, underfinanced and underprepared to take on an influx of mentally ill patients. Added to this, none of them had valid licences.&rdquo; Makgoba also described the frighteningly easy process required to receive a licence from the Gauteng Health Department to start an NGO. Makgoba said that government needed to look at how patients had gone from a licensed institution to unlicensed ones, and it should also look at reviewing the licensing policy.In the meantime, police are said to be encountering unexpected obstacles in their efforts to identify 19 of the bodies believed to be of psychiatric patients who died after the tragedy. Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said on Tuesday the bodies had come from NGOs but they still remained unidentified months later.Motsoaledi said the department was on track with implementing Makgoba&rsquo;s recommendations, as stated in his report.
