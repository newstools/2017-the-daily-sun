HAVING a good run in the Caf Confederation Cup won&rsquo;t only benefit the club, but also the country in the long run.That&rsquo;s what SuperSport United defender, Morgan Gould, believes.Gould seems to be taking a leaf out of continental champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, who had a remarkable run in Africa, and have the same streak in the domestic league.Matsatsantsa a Pitori will be hoping to emulate their neighbours when they commence their Confed Cup campaign today.They face Madagascar&rsquo;s Elgeco Plus in the preliminary round of the competition at Stade Municipal de Mahamasina in Antananarivo (1.30pm).Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s charges will go into the game in high spirits, having demolished Golden Arrows 5-2 midweek in their first Absa Premiership game.Said Gould: &ldquo;You grow as a team, you grow as a nation. Sundowns have learnt a lot. They came back with players playing in the national team. We&rsquo;ve learnt a lot.&rdquo;The former Kaizer Chiefs man said the competition will bring excitement to the team. Gould is unphased by the extra amount of work they will have to put in playing in three competitions.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an exciting time for us at SuperSport. I came back to SuperSport because it&rsquo;s a place where I felt I would grow.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been with them through a lot of challenges, but I have been through a lot of challenges in the past six years and I managed to stick it through and maintain a level head and continue working.&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been playing much in the last two years. I&rsquo;m taking as much game time, even if it means I must play against crocodiles, I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; he added.SuperSport, who have been ravaged by injuries season long, will be hoping some of those players will be fit enough to return to the field.Baxter will be forced to rotate players due to the casualties.Said Baxter: &ldquo;Maybe, we&rsquo;ll get a couple of those injured players back.We&rsquo;ll rotate, but rotating won&rsquo;t be taking turns. If you deserve to play, you will. If you&rsquo;re tired, we will rest you and give you some time out.&rdquo;
