IT&rsquo;S less than one percent, but any growth in the number of jobs must be seen as a silver lining around Mzansi&rsquo;s dark cloud of unemployment.Statistician-General Pali Lehohla yesterday gave citizens a glimmer of hope when he said statistics for the fourth quarter of 2016 showed employment had grown by 235 000 jobs.This, together with the fact that the number of job seekers declined by 92 000, resulted in a slight decline in the official unemployment rate to 26,5%.Lehohla was releasing the results of the quarterly labour force survey for 2016&rsquo;s fourth quarter in Tshwane.In true statistician&rsquo;s fashion, however, he poured cold water on the positive news, adding that the 26,5% was still 2% higher compared to the same period last year.Lehohla said employment growth was largely driven by the services industry which grew by 73 000, followed by transport and manufacturing, which grew by 46 000 and 44 000 jobs respectively. All the other industries reported quarter-to-quarter employment growth except for mining and construction, which declined by 17 000 and 9 000 respectively. The unemployment rate declined in four of the nine provinces, with the North West registering the biggest decline, of 4%.Lehohla said the youth sector aged 15 to 34 remains the most vulnerable in the labour market, with an unemployment rate of 37,1%.
