They continued to dominate and Joseph Molongoane should have done better than shoot straight at Mpandle after he was teed up by Bernard Parker in the 14th minute.United hit back with a chance of their own when Mokate calmly held off his marker and forced Itumeleng Khune to turn the ball wide with a diving stop to his right. The chances continued to come and Ramahlwe Mphahlele then headed a Tshabalala corner inches wide.This was followed by Khune being drawn into another diving stop from Kwanda Mngonyama's shot. Yet, it was goalless at the break, but five minutes after the restart the visitors were ahead. The goal came through a set-piece as George Maluleka's floated ball from the left was completely misjudged by Mpandle at the far post, where an unmarked Katsande was lurking and fully capitalised.United could have replied within seconds of the restart, but Bandile Shandu saw his weighted shot deflected centimetres over. But Mokate did level with 18 minutes to play when he fired into the far corner after a smart short pass from Lebohang Maboe from inside the box.Provider almost turned to scorer minutes later as he was set up on the edge of the box and forced a fine diving stop from Khune. With the match swaying from end-to-end, it was the away side that then struck the telling blow 10 minutes from time as Tshabalala ended another flowing move by tapping in Mphahlele's pin-point cross from the right.
