NO TEACHING could take place at Noninzi Luzipho Primary in Gunguluza, Uitenhage for a second day as protesting parents kept the school closed.The parents demand that the education department fix their rotting school, saying they&rsquo;ve been waiting since 2004.There was no sign of Valentine&rsquo;s Day celebrations in the town and instead black smoke from burning tyres rose into the air. Parents placed rocks across Helen Joseph Street as the school&rsquo;s 958 pupils and teachers were barred from entering.Parents sang: &ldquo;On your marks, get set, we are ready to go to the department!&rdquo;Others carried placards and blew whistles.The parents later boarded a bus to go to the district office of the department of education. They demanded that funds be made available to build a new school.A teacher said: &ldquo;A report by the department stated that a tender to build a new school was published, but it&rsquo;s a lie.&rdquo;Nomvuyo Toze (45) from the school governing body said: &ldquo;Officials didn&rsquo;t arrive on Monday as they promised. We told the pupils to stay at home. We can&rsquo;t allow them to be taught in a school where the buildings are full of holes.&rdquo; Toze said they were addressed by officials yesterday afternoon, but parents were still unhappy.&ldquo;We are going to enter a third day with the school still closed.&rdquo;The department&rsquo;s Malibongwe Mtima said: &ldquo;A committee of residents and officials will look at a solution to this problem.&rdquo;
