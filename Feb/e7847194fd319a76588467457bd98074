T HE 2017 Africa Nations Cup came with thrills, spills, agony, tears, joy and triumph for the indomitable lions of Cameroon.Once again, Southern Africa failed to go past the group stages. For most players from Zimbabwe, now is the time to wipe your tears by winning silverware in the PSL.On Tuesday, Willard Katsande showed individual brilliance when he scored an incredible goal for Amakhosi in their 3-1 hammering of Free State Stars.Siphiwe &ldquo;Ntho Tse Monate&rdquo; Tshabalala&rsquo;s goal may have set the tone for the evening, but it was Katsande who stole the limelight.Hopefully, this year will bring good fortune to Naturena.That night resulted in 15 goals, overall. But the shocker came from Bidvest Stadium, where the Clever Boys and their coach, Gavin Hunt, showed their title aspirations. They scored five goals past the hapless Ajax Cape Town.On the other hand, Ajax neighbours, Cape Town City, led by influential captain Lebogang Manyama, scored three goals. The ambitious Chippa United were also inspired, registering their first win of the new year.The following night also packed all the ingredients of a goals-galore recipe.Orlando Pirates and Platinum Stars have had great battles in the past, so it&rsquo;s no surprise that no-one expected a goalless draw from them.This game was a yawn, and the less said about it, the better. In Bloemfontein, Siwelele wanted to redeem what had been a disastrous season, but African champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, were not in the mood to donate points. Downs may have scored a late goal, but it counted.But the toast of the night came from the nations capital Pretoria, where SuperSport United walloped Golden Arrows 5-2.The KwaZulu-Natal side was blunt upfront, and Matsatsantsa A Pitori used every chance they created to regain their position at the summit of the Absa Premiership.The 25 goals, scored in just two days after a long break, were inspiring.It certainly beats watching the goal-drought disaster zone called the PSL.Now, give us more!
