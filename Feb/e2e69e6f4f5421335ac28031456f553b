FOR the past two months, Mercia says she has been trying to run away from a horny Ben 10. She told Daily Sun that Phuti Stati (25) has been pleading for her punani.&ldquo;He told me he wanted my punani and that he was serious about it,&rdquo; claimed Mercia Mantsoe of Katlehong, Ekurhuleni.The 43-year-old claimed when she told the boy she didn&rsquo;t want to be sexually involved with him last week, he lost his cool and started swearing at her.&ldquo;He called me names before breaking all the windows in my house.&rdquo;Now Mercia claimed she and her children live in fear of the horny man.&ldquo;He wants punani so badly that he could do anything. Who knows what else he could do to us while we sleep as the house has no windows. &ldquo;This means he could gain access any time,&rdquo; said Mercia.She said she saw Phuti as her child.&ldquo;Not so long ago, he used to play in my yard with my children, and today he wants to be their stepfather! This is out of order.&rdquo; Mercia claimed she tried to speak to his family but none of them showed any interest in her story. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I decided to call Daily Sun. Maybe someone will know what to do in a situation like this.&rdquo; While the SunTeam was still interviewing Mercia, Phuti was seen standing in his yard and the SunTeam spoke to him. He denied Mercia&rsquo;s claims.&ldquo;Why would I want an old woman like that. I am young and I love my body.&rdquo;He said Mercia was crazy to think that he wanted her.Katlehong police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Katlehong Police Station.
