THE Hawks are offering a reward of R100 000 for information that leads to the arrest of Mpumalanga politician Michael Phelembe&rsquo;s killers. Phelembe, an ANC branch deputy chairman in Pienaar&rsquo;s Ward 23, near Mbombela in Mpumalanga, was gunned down in his yard on 27 May last year. At the time, those close to him said Phelembe had spoken of a hit list before he was killed, and said his name was on it. He claimed the people who compiled the hit list wanted to control the allocation of tenders in the area.Phelembe&rsquo;s claims were allegedly based on information he discovered while working as an engineer for the department of public works, roads and transport. It detailed at least 10 companies hoping to obtain tenders worth millions for the construction of roads in the township. Captain Dineo Sekgotodi, the Mpumalanga Hawks spokeswoman, said it has been nine months since the killing took place, and despite diligent investigations, no breakthrough has been made.&ldquo;Phelembe had just returned from a night vigil when an unknown number of gunmen opened fire on him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They then fled the scene. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation is now offering a reward of R100 000 for information that could possibly assist in arrests and a successful prosecution.&rdquo;Anyone with information should contact investigating officer Detective-Warrant Officer Petrus Nkosi on 082 303 9746.
