IT WAS supposed to be a day of fun, but it ended in tragedy.Five teenagers went for a swim on Tuesday in a river at Dludluma Trust in Tonga, Mpumalanga.But sadly, only two of them came out alive.The two boys in the swimming party managed to save themselves but the three girls, aged 13, 14 and 15 years, were swept away and drowned. According to a witness, while the girls and boys were swimming the river suddenly filled up.The boys saved themselves, but the girls were dragged further out and then disappeared. Members of the community managed to recover two bodies and the third was retrieved later by police divers. A family member of one of the girls told Daily Sun that what happened had left them in shock.&ldquo;We were hoping that we would see a bright future for our daughter, but she was taken away from us so soon,&rdquo; she said.Although the family was still unable to come to terms with the death of the teen, they felt that if it was God&rsquo;s plan to take her in such a way, then nothing could have been done to prevent it.Mpumalanga&rsquo;s SAPS spokesman, Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, said the police were always asking the community to look after their kids, especially if they were playing in rivers or dams. &ldquo;This is an unfortunate situation in which three young lives have been quashed in a blink of an eye, which could have been avoided,&rdquo; Hlathi said.He advised that during rainy periods such as these the people should look after their children, and the children themselves also had a responsibility to listen to their parents.
