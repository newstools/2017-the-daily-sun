In-form Kaizer Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka attributes his recent good showings to the fact he shares a good relationship with Willard Katsande in the centre of the park.Maluleka, who has been revelling in a more advanced central midfield role ahead of Katsande in the holding position, told the club's official website that it was partly his midfield partner's influence that was helping him to excel.He said: "I enjoy playing at the number eight position. However, my good form also has a lot to do with the guidance I get from Katsande. He has been tremendous. He talks so much to me during the 90 minutes. To be honest, he shouts at me!"Not much has changed. It's just that our mindset has taken a different direction. The mindset is now more positive. We also have a clearer understanding of what we want to achieve."Maluleka will likely start in Chiefs' next game against Highlands Park on Saturday at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. The action begins from 18:00.
