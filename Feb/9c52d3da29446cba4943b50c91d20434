ALTHOUGH Bongani Shange has lost everything he ever owned, he&rsquo;s glad to be alive.The 41-year-old security guard from KwaMancinza, north of Durban escaped death when his one-roomed shack was struck by lightning and burnt to ashes on Monday night.He told Daily Sun that if he or his family members had been sleeping in the shack, they would have all died. He said he was working night shift and his family members were sleeping in another room during the heavy storm that hit north of Durban.&ldquo;I received a call from my sister as I was returning home from work, telling me that my shack was burnt. I was shocked to find all my belongings in ashes.&rdquo; He said all his security certificates, ID and other important documents were destroyed. All he has left are his uniform and a T-shirt that he wore under it.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the lightning was sent by someone who wanted to kill me. I don&rsquo;t have enemies or ex-girlfriends who would want me dead. &ldquo;I think it was just bad luck.&rdquo; But he would appreciate any donations. His neighbour, Nomusa Ngidi (55) said they all rushed to Bongani&rsquo;s shack to try and put the fire out. Councillor Simon Khuboni said: &ldquo;I will contact disaster management to assist him. I will add him to the list of beneficiaries for a house under the disaster project.&rdquo;
