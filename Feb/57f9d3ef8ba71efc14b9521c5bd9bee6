RAPPER, Fifi Cooper, has parted ways with her record label, Ambitiouz Entertainment.&nbsp;Fifi, real name Refiloe Moeketsi, was said to have been shown the door last week by company owner, Kgosi Mahumapelo.Sunday Sun sources claimed Fifi was axed for allegedly repeatedly breaching the terms of her contract.Her alleged misbehaviour included disappearing for weeks, going to important radio interviews drunk, bringing the company into disrepute, swearing at employees and demanding cash from her bosses.&ldquo;She wanted money to fix her brother&rsquo;s car that she had overturned,&rdquo; claimed a Sunday Sun source.This insider also alleged: &ldquo;Fifi threatened Kgosi that she would tell the media Ambitiouz doesn&rsquo;t have money to take care of its artists. He then told her she should also tell the same media she was no longer part of Ambitiouz.&rdquo;Another showbiz mole claimed Fifi had failed to pitch for an interview on Metro FM.&ldquo;When she was asked what happened, Fifi said she was tired and should be left alone,&rdquo; the source alleged.A third mole claimed Fifi spent most of her time in night clubs, drinking with friends who were feeding off her.While Kgosi has allegedly let Fifi go, A-Reece and hip hop crew, Benchmarq, are also said to be demanding to be released.A-Reece allegedly refused to perform in Bloemfontein, which forced Ambitiouz to pay back the money to the promoter.The third source alleged: &ldquo;A-Reece and Benchmarq asked the promoter to pay them directly, and they then performed. So, Kgosi sent them all letters of demand.&rdquo;Fifi dismissed all the allegations.She said has reached a breaking point and can&rsquo;t stay another day at Ambitiouz.&nbsp;She said: &ldquo;There are many reasons why I left. I want to grow, but most importantly, I want my money. Fifi said she hasn&rsquo;t received her money from her contract since joining the company. I make money for the company, but I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;Kgosi confirmed Fifi was no longer with Ambitiouz Entertainment. He said: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true Fifi is no longer with Ambitiouz.&rdquo;When pressed further, Kgosi said the matter is sub judice and is currently with his legal team.A-Reece and Benchmarq could not be reached for comment.I&rsquo;ve learned I&rsquo;m ready and it&rsquo;s TIME!!!!&nbsp;Please NOTE that whatever u see on my Facebook fan page isn&rsquo;t me..
