AVRAM Grant will leave his post as Ghana coach following Saturday&rsquo;s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) third place play-off 1-0 defeat to Burkina Faso, officials said.Grant&rsquo;s two-year contract would not be renewed and the search was on for a successor, senior Ghana Football Association officials told Reuters.The former Chelsea manager took over as Ghana coach one month before the last Afcon in Equatorial Guinea and took the side to the final, where they lost to Ivory Coast on penalties.At the tournament in Gabon, Ghana reached the semifinals but were beaten 2-0 by Cameroon in Port-Gentil last Thursday.Israeli Grant avoided questions about his future, saying now was not the time to talk it.Ghana made a poor start to their World Cup qualifying group with a single point from two games. They have now qualified for six successive Afcon semifinals but their last victory in the tournament came 35 years ago. Alain Traore scored with one minute left to give Burkina Faso their 1-0 win over Ghana and third place at Afcon. The Turkey-based attacker thumped an angled free-kick over goalkeeper Richard Ofori and into the net.It was the second highest finish in the biennial African football showcase for the Burkinabe Stallions, who finished runners-up four years ago.The Black Stars have played in five third-place play-offs, losing four.Ghana could have been several goals ahead by half-time as they dominated possession, only to be let down by poor finishing and bad luck.New Swansea City signing Jordan Ayew handled when poised to shoot from close range with the play-off less than a minute old.Stand-in captain Emmanuel Agye&shy;mang Badu headed just wide in the third minute and Bernard Tekpetey struck the crossbar during a goalmouth scramble.Then Tekpetey, one of the six changes after a semifinal loss to Cameroon two days ago, headed just over on the hour mark after a free-kick.Ofori, the lone Ghana-based player in the squad and getting a first start of the tournament, rescued his team several times before Traore struck. &ndash; AFP-REUTERS
