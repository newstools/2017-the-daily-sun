CONTROVERSIAL Prophet Paseka &ldquo;Mboro&rdquo; Motsoeneng hosted Gauteng police at his church yesterday. A large number of police officers attended the service at Incredible Happenings Church in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni to receive divine protection.He said the recent death of Constable Tshepo Tladi, who was allegedly shot by his colleagues in the line of duty, was what moved him to host the service. Mboro said the incident has created a lot of mistrust between officers. &ldquo;Some of you are already thinking what would happen if you got shot by one of your colleagues.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have Doom or snakes to feed you. All I have is the bread of life, which is Jesus Christ,&rdquo; said Mboro. Otto Sibeko, chairman of the Katlehong North community policing forum, pleaded with patrollers to assist the police in fighting crime.&ldquo;You should stop harbouring criminals, as they are killing the police,&rdquo; said Sibeko.Joburg North deputy cluster commander Brigadier Paulus Lukhwareni thanked Mboro for the invite.
