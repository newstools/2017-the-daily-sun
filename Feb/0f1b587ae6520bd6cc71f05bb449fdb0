The loyal dog, who was stabbed six times after defending his owner from an attacker with a knife, was given a party with chicken, cake and sweets! Buda was discharged from a veterinary hospital in Soweto on Friday and owner Jacobeth Mphuti (41) was overjoyed to welcome him back to Ratanda, Heidelberg, Gauteng. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Buda wagged his tail as his jaw sank into two braaied chickens and other treats bought specially for him. He was joined by three other local dogs. A 24-year-old relative tried to stab Jacobeth with a knife but Buda came to the rescue. The relative was arrested for animal cruelty and is out on bail. Jerry Selwane of the Soweto Animal Rescue and Advisory Centre said Buda was doing well after being treated. “We are happy the incident led to people in Ratanda respecting pets. We might have a workshop in the area to educate people.” Relative Thomas Mazibuko said the dog had always been good at identifying thugs. “We have a saviour in this dog and he has really proved it.”
