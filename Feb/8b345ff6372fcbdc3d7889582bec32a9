Cape Town City can go top of the table for the weekend with victory over Orlando Pirates at the Cape Town Stadium on Saturday night.The Mother City club are second on the standings behind Bidvest Wits only on goal difference, while the Johannesburg side are busy with CAF Champions League commitments this weekend.The Citizens have made an outstanding start to 2017, beating Highlands Park 3-0 and Ajax Cape Town 2-0.Pirates meanwhile are 10th, 12 points off the top of the table after losing 6-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns last Saturday before being edged 2-1 by Bidvest Wits in midweek.Apart from their unhappy start to the year, the Buccaneers also have an issue in goal as Brighton Mhlongo is out injured and Jackson Mabokgwane is suspended after a red card against the Students.Siyabonga Mpontshane is the man expected to step into the sticks in what would be his first start of the season, while it's been reported but not officially confirmed that Pirates have signed Nigerian shot-stopper Emmanuel Daniel.Following Bucs chairman Irvin Khoza's announcement on Monday that the club are to announce their new head coach next week, Saturday's game may be the final match in charge for caretaker coach Augusto Palacios.The Peruvian has several injury concerns to his outfield players as well - Thabo Rakhale is missing for a few weeks with a hamstring problem, while Thabo Qalinge, Gift Motupa, Mpho Makola and Issa Sarr all missed the Wits game through injury and remain doubtful starters.Cape Town City's former Pirates head coach Eric Tinkler has no such problems and has enjoyed a dream start to his tenure at the newly-formed club.But he's not reading too much into the Sea Robbers' recent form and wants to ensure there is no complacency from his men."We simply have to continue the good work against Pirates," said Tinkler.&nbsp;"It will be very tough that's for sure - You can't judge Pirates on their last two games. They have lots of quality in their squad and the players will be determined to prove that they belong there."As a team, we will have to be organised and disciplined and respect the opponents."At the same time, we have to play to our strengths. We aren't where we are because of luck or fortune, it's because of hard work and we have to stick to the correct principles against Pirates."The home side do not have any suspensions or reported injuries.
