CALLING for the mayor s head, the protesters called him a sellout and demanded that he step down. They were protesting against Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba, claiming he was responsible for 8 000 job losses because he cut programmes such as Jozi@Work.The march in Braamfontein saw protesters handing over a memorandum of grievance to Mashaba and Gauteng Legislature deputy speaker Uhuru Moiloa. Protester Thabo Moropedi said they were ready to fight. This man has sold our people out. He is just a white man in a black man s skin, said Thabo. He is cutting programmes which uplift communities and create jobs. He is adding to employment problems instead of coming up with solutions. Thabo said 8 000 people have already lost their jobs because of the Jozi@Work programme being cut. Tshepang Mokgatla of the ANC Joburg Social Movement told Daily Sun: We are here, united against Mashaba, to stop the job losses. The mayor said the ANC staged an attack on democracy and added that it was a blatant attempt to prevent the council from passing the adjustment budget. I condemn the violence that has broken out at the Joburg Council in the strongest terms. It has no place in our democracy. He added he will lay charges at Joburg Central Police Station against those responsible for violence and damage to city property. The blame must be squarely put at the feet of the ANC, who assisted the protesters in storming the council chamber, threatening the lives of councillors and city employees. He said Mokgatla was the ANC s councillor candidate in ward 125. He lost the ward to the DA and now is dedicating his time to destabilising this administration.
