And he doesn&rsquo;t feel sorry after attacking her, she said. Instead, he is arrogant.&ldquo;It got to the point where I decided to move out and build a shack,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.Last week, she went to the house to check if everything was in order. But it wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; she found all her furniture gone!&ldquo;He took all the furniture, electronic appliances, TV, radio, kettle and microwave and sold them,&rdquo; she said.Sergeant Tshepiso Mashale of the Roodepoort Police Station told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The young man is in police custody and two cases have been opened for possession of drugs and for stolen goods.&rdquo;
