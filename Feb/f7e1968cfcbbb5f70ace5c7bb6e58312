AS expected, Orlando Pirates have been very busy during the January transfer window recruiting talent to bolster their squad ahead of the second round of the Absa Premiership. The club have signed up four new players &ndash; but which ones have moved on? SunSport looks at the players that have left the club:Felipe Ovono: The out-of-favour Equatorial Guinean goalkeeper left the club after both parties mutually agreed to terminate his contract. Nkosinathi Mthiyane: The former Chippa United left back joined Pirates at the start of the 2016/17 PSL season. Following his failure to make it to Bucs&rsquo; 18-man squad, Mthiyane was loaned to Golden Arrows and will play there for the remainder of the season. Justice Chabalala: Having been sought after by both Kaizer Chiefs and Pirates during the 2015/16 campaign, Chabalala penned a three-year-deal with Pirates. He has now been loaned to Chippa United. Sello Jaftha: The 22-year-old joined the Buccaneers last season, having impressed the Soweto club while playing at Free State Stars. But he failed to impress Muhsin Ertugral and now care-taker coach Augusto Palacios, and is now on loan to Chippa.Donald Mokondelela: The lethal forward was signed from Baroka FC last year January but has seen limited playing time for Pirates. He is also on loan to Chippa United. Pirates have signed Marc van Heerden, James Okwuosa and Thembinkosi Lorch &ndash; all from Chippa United. A surprising move was Dove Wome who joined Bucs on loan from SuperSport United.
