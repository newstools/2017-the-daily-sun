WHENEVER it rains, Abel Thobela kneels down to pray!Abel&rsquo;s prayer is for God to spare his shack from being swept away by rain.The recent, much-needed heavy rain that was welcomed by many was a big concern for the father of three who lives in Mamelodi&rsquo;s extension 15.The rains have left a massive trench in his yard. In order for Abel to move from one shack to another, he has to jump over the trench. Abel said he approached the kasi committee for help. &ldquo;They suggested that I ask municipal workers who were fixing electricity in our area to help me.&rdquo; Abel said he was relieved when he saw the trucks heading towards his home, but the workers allegedly demanded a bribe.&ldquo;They told me they wanted &lsquo;cold drink&rsquo; money before they could start work.&ldquo;When I told them I was unemployed and had no money, they left without helping him. I was disappointed because I thought since they work for the municipality, they should help residents for free.&rdquo; Abel claims the workers came back the next day and demanded lunch. &ldquo;They told me they had found out that I sell skop and cattle feet and they asked for free lunch for a week. &ldquo;I was angry because if I were to give them free lunch, I would not make any profit. I told them to leave my yard and never come back.&rdquo; The City of Tshwane&rsquo;s regional director, Sello Chipu, said there are no municipal workers working in extension 15. &ldquo;There is a contractor there helping us with the installation of electricity. Our workers would never ask for a bribe. &ldquo;Municipal workers who fill trenches only do so on the road and not in residents&rsquo; homes.&ldquo;But we will investigate the matter.&rdquo;
