LUIS Suarez scored and was sent off as holders Barcelona reached a fourth successive King&rsquo;s Cup, or Copa Del Rey, final after drawing 1-1 with a resilient Atletico Madrid in an action-packed semifinal second leg on Tuesday.Suarez was one of three players dismissed and will now miss the final after Barcelona edged through 3-2 on aggregate. The Uruguayan tapped in from close range in the 43rd minute after an inspired run and shot from Lionel Messi to deliver a sucker punch to Atletico, who had dominated the first half at the Nou Camp but failed to take their chances.Kevin Gameiro blazed a penalty over the bar with 10 minutes left but the French striker still made for a tense finale by tapping in an Antoine Griezmann cross moments later.Barca defender Sergi Roberto will also be suspended for the final after being sent off for a second booking in the second half and Atletico winger Yannick Carrasco was dismissed as well for a second yellow card. Suarez was then sent off in the 90th minute for an elbow on Atletico midfielder Koke.Barca, the 28-time winners, will meet either Alaves or Celta Vigo in the final in May, seeking a third successive Cup triumph under coach Luis Enrique.&ldquo;We had to suffer, so did our supporters. Perhaps we didn&rsquo;t deserve to go through on this display but given what we&rsquo;ve done in the Cup I think we&rsquo;re worthy finalists,&rdquo; the Barca coach said. Atletico had not won at the Nou Camp in any competition since 2006 and had to take the initiative if they were to stand any chance of going through. They started the second leg as they had ended the first, putting Barca under intense pressure.Atletico looked beaten at the start of the second half but showed grit to get back into the game, even after Griezmann had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside and Carrasco was sent off.&ldquo;Barca were only better than us in goals scored, although that&rsquo;s what counts the most in football,&rdquo; Atletico coach Diego Simeone told reporters. &ldquo;I leave here with a sensation of pride.&rdquo; &ndash; REUTERS
