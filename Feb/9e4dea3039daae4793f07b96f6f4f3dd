WHEN he jumped into a pit toilet full of kak on Tuesday, he thought it would offer refuge from angry residents.He was terribly mistaken.Lindokuhle Saku (24) from Bhambayi in Inanda, north of Durban is recovering from his injuries after a mob moered him for a crime he did not commit.Luckily, cops arrived just in time to save his life.He said he was walking along the road when four angry men armed with pangas accused him of stealing a cellphone.They said they recognised him by the jacket he was wearing.Lindokuhle said: &ldquo;When I told them I knew nothing about a stolen cellphone, they started attacking me.&ldquo;I ran back home as fast as I could and jumped into the pit toilet in our yard.&ldquo;It was full of kak, but I had no choice because I wanted to save my life.&rdquo;He said he spent about two hours in the pit.But when he got out, the men had invited more residents who were silently waiting for him.That&rsquo;s when he was given a serious beating.&ldquo;I begged them to go and look for the phone inside the house and ask my family what time I left the house.&ldquo;I thank my neighbour for calling the cops, otherwise I would have died.&rdquo;The neighbour said he called the police because he knew Lindokuhle was still at his home when the cellphone was stolen. &ldquo;He was busy with his chores and I saw him when he left the house. &ldquo;A few minutes later, I saw him running away from four armed men who claimed he had stolen a cellphone,&rdquo; said the neighbour.Lindokuhle said he will open a case when he gets better, as he is unable to walk or see properly now.Lindokuhle&rsquo;s sister, Nothando (33), said she only realised Lindokuhle had been beaten when he came indoors to wash off the kak.&ldquo;We then rushed him to a local clinic, where he was treated and discharged.&rdquo;
