A NIGERIAN woman has reportedly been charged more than &pound;500 000 (R8,4 million) to give birth to quadruplets at a London hospital.According to Standard UK, the woman only identified as Priscilla (43) had initially intended to give birth in Chicago, USA - where she had family - after being warned that Nigerian hospitals did not have "facilities to cater for the children".She had IVF treatment to help her conceive.Priscilla was, however, turned away by US border officials, who claimed she did not have required documents from a hospital stating that she had money to pay for the delivery, a Vanguard report said.She was on her way back to Nigeria via London in November, 2016 when she started having contractions shortly after landing at Heathrow airport.The woman was rushed to Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s and Chelsea Hospital in West London, where she delivered four babies, three months before her due date.Unfortunately one child died shortly after birth and another died last Saturday.She was now living in a London hostel run by a charity while her two surviving babies, Elijah and Esther, remained in hospital.Hospital officials estimated that the total bill for the highly complex birth and care of the mum and babies was already more than &pound;500 000.The cost of treating one baby in neonatal intensive care was $20 000 (about R337 400) a week.Priscilla&rsquo;s husband was still in Nigeria as he could not afford travel costs to London.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/nigerian-mom-43-gives-birth-to-quads-in-uk-incurres-500-000-bill-20170202
