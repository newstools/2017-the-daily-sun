PUBLIC Protector Busisiwe Mkhwe-bane intends to contest an attempt by President Jacob Zuma to have the State Capture report set aside.&ldquo;But I will get legal opinion first and use the information to decide which way to go.&rdquo; Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday on her first 100 days in office, she said the report is binding. Talking about her job as public protector, she said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect to work that hard to defend my independence and fight back against lies brought against me.&rdquo; She said she does not hate her predecessor, Thuli Madonsela.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the media who feed these rumours.&rdquo;She described her office as the most underfunded institution in the country.&ldquo;We operate at half our potential,&rdquo; she said. Her office has been allocated R263,3 million. She said Nkebe Kanyane, the primary investigator in the State Capture report, had resigned voluntarily after receiving a good offer.She accused the media of almost jeopardising an investigation into billions of rand allegedly lent by the Reserve Bank to Bancorp, which later became Absa.She plans to possibly take legal action against the DA and other parties who allegedly accused her of being a spy and a puppet of the Guptas.She will start a nationwide road show, spending two days in each province, to talk to government leaders on one day and the public on the other.
