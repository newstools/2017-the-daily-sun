MILTON Ncube (33) may have been laid to rest in Zimbabwe, his country of birth, but his family cannot find peace.This after Mzansi cops allegedly left them frustrated in their search for justice.Milton was stabbed to death in NU 15 in Mdantsane, East London two weeks ago. According to his girlfriend, Asiphe Dyasi (22), Milton left her in bed at about 9am and went to smoke outside. After some time, Asiphe asked him to come inside but he stayed outdoors. Half an hour later, shocked Asiphe was told by the landlord that Milton had been stabbed.Milton&rsquo;s brother, Perfect Ncube (23), told Daily Sun the man who killed Milton had asked him for tobacco. &ldquo;When the man entered the yard, Milton recognised him as a man who also sold stolen goods. &ldquo;Milton told the man not to enter because he had once stolen money from him.&ldquo;My brother pushed him and the man took out a knife and stabbed him,&rdquo; he said.His uncle, Lucky Ncube (51), told Daily Sun police misled them. &ldquo;We went to the police station to check when the accused would appear in court. &ldquo;Police said he would make an appearance on 7 February. &ldquo;But when we arrived on the day, we were told the case had been dismissed because there were no witnesses and the accused had already appeared the day before!&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they gave us the wrong information. Maybe it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re foreigners.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Nkosikho Mzuku said the case was only withdrawn temporarily pending further police investigation. &ldquo;The investigation into the case continues and it will be put on the court roll again.&rdquo;
