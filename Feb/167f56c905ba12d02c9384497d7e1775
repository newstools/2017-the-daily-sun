DESPITE their recent success on the continent, Mamelodi Sundowns will not rest on their laurels in their quest to dominate African football. Fresh from their historic 1-0 Caf Super Cup victory over Democratic Republic of Congo giants TP Mazembe at Loftus Versfeld at the weekend, skipper Hlompho Kekana and newcomer Lucky Mohomi said they would not take their foot off the pedal in Africa. Kekana has already bagged two big Caf titles in the form of the Caf Champions League and now the Super Cup trophy, while Mohomi has joined a club that has made a habit of winning silverware. Kekana said: &ldquo;We want to go back and win more trophies on the continent.&rdquo; He added that despite winning big in Africa the players&rsquo; mindset would not change on the domestic front: &ldquo;We are fortunate because we are modest in this team. We can&rsquo;t drop the ball, as we want to win all the time. &ldquo;As professionals we know what is expected from us. We will start from scratch and collect more trophies, both in Africa and locally.&rdquo; Mohomi, who joined the Brazilians from Free State Stars at the beginning of last season, is eager to make a valuable contribution. As a new face in the team, Mohomi is determined to prove to coach Pitso Mosimane that he too can make a difference in the star-studded lineup: &ldquo;Being part of this team is motivation on its own. The coach believes in me but I have to keep dreaming and working hard.&rdquo; The Brazilians got a cheque for R1,3 million, gold medals and a trophy for their efforts. Kekana added that it would be good to see a couple of Brazilians in the Bafana Bafana setup.
