THE family of a 17-year-old pupil who was allegedly raped by her dad say nothing less than a life sentence will do for the accused.The KZN family said they want to teach the 39-year-old father a lesson. The dad allegedly raped her several times in the past two years.On Wednesday, he appeared in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrates Court and he will stay in jail until his next appearance on 28 February.A relative told Daily Sun said: &ldquo;We want the suspect to be sentenced to 25 years in jail. He is very cruel. We want him to be locked up for a very long time because we fail to understand what kind of father would do that to his child. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to live with the community. What worries us most is that this man transports kids to school for a living.&rdquo; The relative said the family suspected something strange was going on in 2015. This was a few months after the girl had moved in with the father from a relative&rsquo;s place. She said the girl has since been taken to a place of safety where she is receiving psychological counselling.
