MZANSI is still reeling from the shocking deaths of the 94 Esidimeni patients when a similar tragedy was apparently prevented.This was after officers from Emfuleni Municipality&rsquo;s social department and cops saved 15 gogos and madalas at an old age home in Sharpeville, Vaal on Monday.The officials and cops first had to threaten to force the gate open before they were allowed to enter Nrate-Nhlokomele Old Age Home.It was subsequently shut down.Workers at the home alleged to Daily Sun that the elderly and frail were abused, starved, not given their medicine and would sometimes go for days without being bathed.&ldquo;The elders would only get sour milk diluted with water and pap most of the time,&rdquo; claimed a worker.&ldquo;The patients were often beaten. When I left in the afternoon they would ask me to take them with. &ldquo;They wore the same clothing all the time. Some smelled because they didn&rsquo;t have baths.&rdquo;Another worker also claimed the elderly were abused. &ldquo;They would tell us how they were wrapped in blankets and blindfolded, with their hands tied so they couldn&rsquo;t escape. Then they&rsquo;d be beaten,&rdquo; she alleged.Sharpeville police spokesman Captain Attie Loate said officials from various departments raided the place.He said when they arrived the owner refused to open. &ldquo;She was obstructing us at first. No one was arrested but the case is under investigation.&rdquo; Emfuleni by-law superintendent Susan Gaba said the conditions at the home were not good. &ldquo;The toilets were dirty, the rooms were stuffy and the occupants didn&rsquo;t look healthy.&ldquo;We decided to close the home. It will be re-opened when it complies with the law. &ldquo;The elders were taken to a local clinic for examination. &ldquo;They will be accommodated at other facilities according to their needs,&rdquo; she said.Centre manager Nthabiseng Temane said she didn&rsquo;t know why the place was raided.&ldquo;If I knew what was happening I could respond. I&rsquo;m hurt because I love those madalas and gogos.&rdquo;
