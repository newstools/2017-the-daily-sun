ALL the man wanted to do was to poo in the bushes, but things got serious when he suddenly stared death in the face.Magezi Chauke (45) from Maphophe, outside Malamulele, Limpopo told the People&rsquo;s Paper he was just squatting down on Saturday afternoon when something told him to look over his shoulder. &ldquo;I saw a huge buffalo coming towards me. &ldquo;I quickly pulled up my trousers and climbed into a tree.&ldquo;The angry buffalo chased past me and disappeared into the bushes,&rdquo; Magezi said.&ldquo;I was scared to come down because I didn&rsquo;t know if the buffalo was hiding somewhere. &ldquo;After a while I came down and ran home.&rdquo; Magezi said he reported the incident to the local tribal authority, who called rangers from the Kruger Game Park. They came and shot the buffalo about 300m from Maphophe&rsquo;s village. The meat was given to residents to share among themselves. Thomas Chauke from SA Wildlife Trade and Regulations said: &ldquo;We received a call from the tribal authority about the buffalo that broke out of the park. The animal was hunted down and killed.&rdquo; He said the buffalo had to be shot because it was endangering people&rsquo;s lives.
