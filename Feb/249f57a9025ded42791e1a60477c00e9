SUSPENDED Baroka FC coach, Jacob Sakala, and technical director, Mark Harrison, have decided to seek legal advice in a bid to stop their suspension. Both members of the technical team, together with Ben Williams, were suspended for allegedly refusing to sign a document mandating them to win four successive league games.&nbsp;Baroka have already lost one of the games against Bidvest Wits, who thrashed them 5-0 midweek, under the guidance of Kgoloko Thobejane, who was recalled from development, to halt the slide.&nbsp; They were also mandated to beat high-flying Cape Town City, Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs, and Polokwane City.&nbsp;Sakala&rsquo;s lawyer Arthur Dlamini told SunSport he had written a letter to Baroka management to get clarity about Sakala&rsquo;s suspension without pay.&nbsp; Said Dlamini: &ldquo;They issued a letter for my client to appear before a disciplinary committee, but we required further particulars.&nbsp;&ldquo;The matter is sub judice. It&rsquo;s what they say (suspension without pay), but we want to know on what basis.&nbsp; Harrison said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak much because the matter is handled by my lawyer.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to Baroka boss, Khurishi Mphahlele, the three will face a disciplinary hearing on 6 and 13 March.&nbsp;Said Mphahlele: &ldquo;The hearing will take place on the dates that I mentioned, and until they appear before the disciplinary committee, I can&rsquo;t comment further.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mphahlele blamed his players&rsquo; lack of experience for poor performances that saw them languish at the bottom of Absa Premiership table.&nbsp;He went on: &ldquo;We had a meeting with the players to motivate them and find solutions to improve the team&rsquo;s performances.&nbsp; &ldquo;The potential is there, but we lack experience. We must earn it and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re learning the hard way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
