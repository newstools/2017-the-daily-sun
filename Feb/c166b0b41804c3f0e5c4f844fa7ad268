WHEN SIFISO sang Mphefumulo Wami, it brought tears to the eyes of the surprised and appreciative audience. He sounded just like Lundi, they said.LUNDI IS GONE, BUT PERHAPS HIS VOICE LIVES ON.Sifiso Semi (26) told Daily Sun he was overwhelmed by the response after his performance. &ldquo;Performing at his funeral has been the highlight of my career. I was honoured to be part of the service. &ldquo;He did a lot for me. I considered him my mentor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lundi is my hero. I have always looked up to Lundi since I was a young boy living in Newcastle.&rdquo; Sifiso, from KZN, has been trending on social media, with people saying it was as if Lundi has woken from the dead. He said: &ldquo;I have been approached by three record labels who want to meet me and are offering deals.&rdquo; He said his mother was a huge gospel fan. &ldquo;I used to sing in the church choir and my mother bought me a cassette of Lundi&rsquo;s music. That was in 1997 and that&rsquo;s when I fell in love with his music. &ldquo;Realising how much I loved Lundi, my mother sent me to Bula Music, which was Lundi&rsquo;s first record company and that&rsquo;s where I first met him.&rdquo; Sifiso said he sang for Lundi, who said he had a lovely voice and said he&rsquo;d like to work with him. Sifiso moved to Joburg and Lundi became his mentor. They worked on many projects together. He featured on Lundi&rsquo;s DVD and was his back-up singer. Lundi died last Friday morning after a long battle with TB of the stomach and a liver condition. The singer&rsquo;s family confirmed that he died while receiving treatment at Edenvale Hospital. &ldquo;I will dedicate my new album to him,&rdquo; said Sifiso.
