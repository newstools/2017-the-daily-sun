THE Absa Premiership match between Ajax Cape Town and Kaizer Chiefs will go ahead at the Athlone Stadium as planned on Saturday at 8.15pm.This was confirmed yesterday by PSL spokesman Lux September.The Urban Warriors CEO Ari Efstathiou said earlier he was worried playing Chiefs at Athlone due to safety concerns.He told a press conference in Cape Town on Tuesday: &ldquo;We can only issue 17 500 tickets for Athlone and when we play Chiefs we average 35 000 (at the Cape Town Stadium).&rdquo;Ajax were therefore worried about fans&rsquo; safety at the Athlone Stadium as they expect a full house. The Cape Town Stadium is unavailable and according to Ajax, the club tried to move the match to Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium without success.However, September stated: &ldquo;Only the PSL can change venues. It is not up to the clubs to decide if they want to change a venue. That is the job of the PSL. &ldquo;This is all news to me. &ldquo;The game goes ahead as scheduled at the Athlone Stadium on Saturday night.&rdquo;Ajax&rsquo;s statement yesterday read: &ldquo;Ajax can officially confirm that the encounter will go ahead at Athlone Stadium.&rdquo;
