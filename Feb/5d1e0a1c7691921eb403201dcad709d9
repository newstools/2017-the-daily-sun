Why did cops have to shoot him? Nobody even stopped to see if he was okay. They just left him there to die.&rdquo; Piet Mkwanazi (39), madala&rsquo;s younger son, said: &ldquo;We want the cop who shot my father to tell us how an old man could have intimidated him. He must be arrested and locked away.&rdquo;The incident follows the ongoing protest that started last Monday against a new company in Nigel said to be employing people from outside Duduza. Police were sent to the area after buildings were torched.Provincial police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said a case of murder had been opened and that the case would be handled by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.
