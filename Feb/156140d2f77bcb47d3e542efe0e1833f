Barcelona were well beaten by Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, and there were few excuses from Luis Enrique, Andres Iniesta, or Sergi Busquets.Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani added to a brace from Angel di Maria to secure a 4-0 win for PSG in the first leg of their Round of 16 clash at Parc des Princes."It was a disastrous game," manager Enrique admitted in the aftermath. "It's not difficult to explain. PSG were better than us from the start."They overcame our pressure and they were better with and without the ball. We were clearly inferior.""We had a dreadful day in a competition that doesn't let you off," Iniesta added. "There's nothing positive, especially not the result. They were better than us in all facets of the game. There's no explanation."Barca have met PSG three times in the Champions League in recent seasons and knocked them out at each asking, but making it four in a row in the second leg at Camp Nou will require a monumental performance."It's not about the attitude, it's was a football thing," Busquets told UEFA&rsquo;s website. "PSG were better tactically. It will be very difficult at Camp Nou but we will try. We always try."
