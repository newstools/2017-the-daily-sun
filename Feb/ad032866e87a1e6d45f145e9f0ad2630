Two of the leading contenders to win the league, Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, meet in a mouth-watering clash at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday, 6pm.Playing catch-up after their continental and international exploits, Sundowns have been on a remarkable run of form, winning nine and losing only one of their last 11 league outings.This has seen Pitso Mosimane's men move to within five points of the top of the table, the position currently occupied by their opponents on Saturday, Wits.The Students have won four of their last five league matches, including a midweek 5-0 thumping of Baroka FC. Downs, meanwhile, scraped through with a 2-1 victory over Platinum Stars, thanks to a late Khama Billiat goal, in their midweek action.Having finished second on the table behind defending champions Sundowns last season, the Johannesburg side can make a real statement of intent with victory this weekend.Speaking ahead of the game, Wits coach Gavin Hunt though was very mindful of Sundowns' quality and class."They are undoubted [favourites]; it's unbelievable what they've done there and so we've got great respect and great humility going there."But it's a game; it's part of the calendar and we're looking forward to it."Approach doesn't change too much. We know what we have to do and we'll try and execute the best we can on a big stage," he was quoted saying by KickOff.Clever Boys striker Phakamani Mahlambi is expected to feature, despite having supposed to have joined the South African U-20 team for the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations.Mosimane, meanwhile, is sweating over the availability of three key players with Billiat, Anthony Laffor and Anele Ngconcgca - all injury doubts after taking knocks in the Stars game,"It would be a blow if we were to miss all three players at the same time, especially [when] our schedule is this tight, but we can never use that as an excuse."As long as we have 11 players on the field and seven substitutes, we have to fight on," he told the Sundowns website.Neither team have any suspensions. Sundowns though have a lengthy list of key players one card away from a suspension, including Hlompho Kekana, Percy Tau, Tiyani Mabunda and Sibusiso Vilakazi, the former Wits midfielder.This is the first time the teams are meeting in the league this season. The Students beat Sundowns 3-0 back in October last year in the MTN8 final.
