GOGO Seboko Madutlela (86) of D3 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane has owned her house for 54 years.This is the house she once shared with her late husband, who was also the father of her children.But today she claims that she&rsquo;s treated like rubbish by her makoti.She and her daughter are forced to sleep and cook outside their own house, while the woman lives in luxury inside their home.She said in 2004 her son introduced the woman to them. And later that year, the woman moved in with them. She said she pretended to care about them until her son died in 2005.After his burial, the makoti threw her and her eldest daughter Agnes Madutlela (65) out of the house.The two started to sleep outside and were prevented from using all electrical appliances in the house.&ldquo;We now have to cook outside.&rdquo; She said she only allows them to sleep on the dining-room floor when it&rsquo;s raining.When approached by the SunTeam, the makoti locked herself in her bedroom. She said her name was Renny Mokola and refused to comment further.Jan Mawela, community policing forum spokesman, said they have been trying to help the gogo for a long time but it seems the woman won&rsquo;t give up.
