UNDERTAKER George Kotelo of Kotelo Funeral Parlour in Soshanguve, Tshwane, told Daily Sun a friend who owns a mortuary approached him to store bodies for him because he said his mortuary fridges were full. &ldquo;What was strange was that the bodies he sent to me had no names, their families did not come to claim them and they were from various race groups,&rdquo; said George. He said he did not know the bodies were from NGOs where mentally ill patients had died, but then a woman came looking for her mother&rsquo;s body.&ldquo;She said her mum was kept in a centre in Joburg and was then taken to another in Tshwane, where she died. The family did not know about the transfer and death of their loved one.&rdquo;He said when the health ombudsman&rsquo;s report was released and the MEC resigned, his friend disappeared.Kotelo now fears that officials want to close down his business.An NGO Daily Sun wrote about is still operating, even after residents complained that mentally ill patients were held hostage. The department has said the matter will be investigated.
