IT IS not raining but pouring for Baroka FC!Things are not going the way they want at all for relegation-threatened Baroka.Coach Kgoloko Thobejane promised fans that they will be gunning for the Absa Premiership title when the season kicked off but now they sit at the bottom of the log with 13 points from 18 games.Bakgaka have only registered two wins in the league.They were hoping to copy what Leicester City did in the Barclays Premier League by winning the league title after gaining immediate promotion. However, their version of this fairytale story is a dream turned to dust. The PSL rookies have managed to grab two points from their last six fixtures and Thobejane admitted that their hope of winning the league was further dented by their 5-0 humiliation against Bidvest Wits at Milpark Stadium yesterday. Thobejane said: &ldquo;How can we still have the same feeling of winning the league when we are at the bottom with so few games left? There is no way we can say we still believe that we will win the league. We are out of the race now. What we need to do is fight to get out of relegation and maintain our status in the PSL.&rdquo;Thobejane also insisted that his job as coach of the Limpopo-based club is not safe. This is despite being recalled back to coach the team after he was fired a few weeks ago and was replaced by Jacob Sakala, who is now suspended. Sakala, and his assistants Mark Harrison and Edward Williams, are expected to appear at a disciplinary hearing at the club on 6 March.He added: &ldquo;How can I say I am safe? It is not my competency as a coach to say I am safe. It is management&rsquo;s decision to decide if I am safe or not. If they come and tell me I stop here, I will have to stop here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
