MARITZBURG United head coach Roger de Sa is wary of SuperSport United ahead of their Absa Premiership showdown at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Tshwane tomorrow (7.30pm). While the Team of Choice have had a 10-day break to prepare for this match, SuperSport on the other hand have been busy throughout. They beat Madagascar outfit Elgeco Plus in their Caf Confederation Cup 2-1 to progress to the next round of the competition along with Platinum Stars.Jeremy Brockie and Layle Lakay were on the scoresheet for Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s lads, who will now face Al-Ahly Shendi of Sudan on the weekend of 10-12 March, with the return leg set for the weekend of 17-19 March.Baxter said they could have scored a lot of goals but gave some of their players who had not played due to injury a run.He added that they would release Mondli Mpoto and Teboho Mokoena to the national Under-20 side for the Africa Youth Cup of Nations in Zambia from 26 February to 12 March.But De Sa, whose last match was a 2-1 home defeat to Kaizer Chiefs last week, says despite the break they have had, they are cautious of United. &ldquo;Stuart has assembled a good squad,&rdquo; said De Sa.&ldquo;He used a new team in their game against the African opposition, which shows how big his squad is. In my view, they are title contenders, a well-organised, strong and difficult team to beat. Honestly, this will be a tough match for us.&rdquo;The good thing for De Sa is that they have a few players returning to action, including Kurt Lentjies and Bevan Fransman, who will be available after serving their suspensions. &ldquo;Blessing Moyo is another player back from injury. We will see whether he is ready to play in this match or not,&rdquo; said De Sa.This will be De Sa&rsquo;s third match in charge of Maritzburg since taking over in January.
