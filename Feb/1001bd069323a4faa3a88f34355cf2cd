THE biggest threat to confidence is to see a pupil walking to school without shoes! These were the words of the KwaDukuza mayor Ricardo Mthembu at a special uniform handover at Tshelabantu Primary School in Doringkop, on the north coast of KZN, on Tuesday.Mthembu used the platform to underline the need to improve the rural schooling system. After parents complained that rural school pupils face many challenges such as walking long distances and going to school barefoot, Mthembu said his council made the necessary changes to improve the quality of education at poor schools.He said since 2012, his municipality has delivered over 1 200 school uniforms to pupils at these schools.&ldquo;We adopted the programme in 2012 as one of our flagship projects.&ldquo;It aims to make an impact on the challenges faced by the youth and vulnerable children.&rdquo;&ldquo;This year we are rolling out a programme targeting 18 schools and 350 pupils,&rdquo; said Mthembu.He said they have visited over eleven schools in the municipality since last Tuesday. These included Etete, Mgqwabagqwaba and Ziphozethu primary Schools.A grade 3 pupil, Siphephile Xulu (9), was excited about the new shoes that he received from the mayor on Tuesday.He said he didn&rsquo;t have school shoes before he got his new pair.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll no longer walk barefoot to school and none of the children who have school shoes will make fun of me anymore.&rdquo; He said his parents were unemployed.
