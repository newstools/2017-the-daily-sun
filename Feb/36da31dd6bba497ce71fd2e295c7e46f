WHEN SunGirl Mavi Ngcobo needed to pee on Tuesday she rushed into a women&rsquo;s toilet &ndash; only to find there was a long, slow queue.But the women weren&rsquo;t waiting to use the toilet!As Mavi was standing in the queue for the toilet in Isipingo, KZN, a woman told her: &ldquo;This is for punani warmers, not to pee.&rdquo;Another woman was sitting at a table in a corner of the room. The table was covered in powders, pills and some tablets that looked like sweets.As Mavi approached the table, a woman stopped her.&ldquo;Sorry sisi, it is not your turn. I&rsquo;m here to buy the powder that saved me from losing boyfriends.&ldquo;I will buy extra today, as Valentine&rsquo;s Day is near. I want my boyfriend to have it hotter.&rdquo;The hawker, Nomthi Gcwensa (30) from Umbumbulu, said: &ldquo;These are punani warmers.&ldquo;They help women to keep their punanis hot and dry during sex. Some women have wet punanis that drive men away.&rdquo;She said she sold her products from the toilet because it is private and restricted to women only.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want men to see women buying these products.&rdquo;Nomthi said she heard that men love hot punanis.&ldquo;Not every woman has that.&rdquo; She mixes traditional herbs she gets in rural Umbumbulu, and gets the sweets and pills from Chinese shops.A happy 32-year-old customer said the warmers really work.&ldquo;I can sleep with two men in one day and both will be happy,&rdquo; she said.
