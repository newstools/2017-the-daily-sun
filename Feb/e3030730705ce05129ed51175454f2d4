&ldquo;REST in Peace, Ade!&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the message written near the front doorstep of the Mojake family&rsquo;s house in Bergman, Mangaung on Sunday morning.&nbsp; When the family woke up that morning, they had no idea their loved one, Adelaide Mojake (17), had been killed the previous night.&nbsp; Adelaide&rsquo;s boyfriend is accused of stabbing her to death at a local tavern.&nbsp; Her father, Clifford Mojake (65), said he was sleeping when someone knocked on his door.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I went to open the door, no one was there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I looked around and saw Adelaide&rsquo;s boyfriend at the corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told me my child had been stabbed to death at a local tavern but claimed he didn&rsquo;t know who killed her,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Clifford said when the boyfriend left, he noticed the message written on the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not afraid to leave a note at my doorstep after killing my child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always warned my daughter not to go to taverns. Look what has happened now. Tavern owners must stop serving underage kids,&rdquo; said heartbroken Clifford.&nbsp; He said he only had two children and did not expect either one of them to die young.&nbsp; A witness who was with Adelaide and her boyfriend at the tavern claimed Adelaide was there with another boy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her jealous boyfriend arrived and asked to speak to her outside the tavern.&nbsp; &ldquo;He kissed her before stabbing her to death.&nbsp; &ldquo;We wanted to take the law into our hands and beat him up, but he disappeared into thin air,&rdquo; claimed the witness.&nbsp; Police spokeswoman Constable Mosili Ntsika confirmed the incident.&nbsp; She said Adelaide was declared dead on the way to hospital.&nbsp; A murder case has been opened and a suspect who was arrested on the day of the killing will appear in court today.&nbsp;
