SLEEPING in a house that could kill you at any time is a terrible way to live. This is what Thembelani Ncwangule experiences every day.The 39-year-old from Kwesa-Kwa Mthethwa near Empangeni, KZN, lives in a one-roomed shack with his 77-year-old father, Mnoneleli Mqalani. But they live in fear that it will collapse on them. &ldquo;We have been fearing for our lives for years. Heavy summer rain always threatens our lives.&ldquo; During the winter we have to get extra blankets from our neighbours because the cold comes in through holes in the shack,&rdquo; he said. He said their only source of income was his father&rsquo;s pension money and occasional piece jobs he gets, like cutting grass for neighbours. He said he usually gets about R300 for a job, which he has to send to his five children, aged between three and 17. Thembelani claimed the area&rsquo;s previous councillor promised to help his family but has failed to deliver. He said he reported the matter to the current councillor, who promised to inspect his shack but never came. &ldquo;We have lost hope that we will ever get help with our painful situation. &ldquo;We wish someone could donate bags of cement and concrete blocks, enough for us to build a stronger structure so we can feel safe.&rdquo;Councillor Timothy Biyela said he was working to help Thembelani and his father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making arrangements to get a Wendy House in Durban. &ldquo;It should be delivered before the end of the week and it will give them shelter while I work on getting them a proper house.&rdquo;
