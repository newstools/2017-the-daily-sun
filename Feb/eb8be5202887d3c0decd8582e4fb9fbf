THEY were tired of waiting for their road to be fixed so they took up their shovels, picks and wheelbarrows and did the job themselves!This week, residents of Mogashoa Village near Jane Furse, Limpopo, fixed a road damaged by rain four months ago. In spite of promises from the Makhuduthamaga local municipality, the road remained damaged.Community leader Jeffrey Tsoka (60) told Daily Sun when people get sick they have to be transported by donkeys to a nearby village so they can be picked up by an ambulance.&ldquo;The ambulance and the taxis have to wait for us in the next village. &ldquo;Thugs also take advantage of the situation and terrorise people, knowing that cop cars can&rsquo;t get here.&ldquo;We had to do something.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to protest but this is not what we voted for. They forgot who voted them into those high positions in the municipality. We love our ANC but they must choose leaders wisely,&rdquo; said Jeffrey.Resident Seolamaledu Matlala said when it rains the children miss school.&ldquo;Teachers who come from outside struggle to get to the school, but we don&rsquo;t blame them &ndash; they have no choice. &ldquo;But we are worried about our children&rsquo;s education.&rdquo;Makhuduthamaga municipal spokesman, Lemson Moropjane, said: &ldquo;We were not aware of the matter. We will investigate. We appeal to the people to submit their problems to the ward councillors or to the municipality. &ldquo;It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest to provide service delivery to the people.&rdquo;
