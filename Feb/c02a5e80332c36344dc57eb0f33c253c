MAMELODI Sundowns wasted the chance to narrow the gap between them and pace setters Cape Town City last night when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Chippa United in an Absa Premiership match at Sisa Dukashe Stadium, Eastern Cape.A win could have moved Downs into third, three points behind City. However, the draw means Downs remain fifth on 26 points from 12 matches, while the Chilli Boys move above Maritzburg United to occupy eighth spot on 29 points from 16 games.Downs coach Pitso Mosimane made eight changes to the lineup that walloped Orlando Pirates 6-0 at the weekend. He rested the majority of his key players including Percy Tau and Khama Billiat for their crucial Caf Super Cup match against DRC giants TP Mazembe at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. He also brought in goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands in place of Dennis Onyango, while striker Yannick Zakri was also given a run as he last started in September last year.His counterpart, Dan Malesela made four changes to the side that beat rookies Baroka FC 2-1 in their last league game played in Port Elizabeth last week.Chippa came into the match hoping to register their first ever win over Downs. The wet surface with patches of mud due to heavy rain never affected the flow of the game as Downs piled pressure on Chippa early on in search of the lead. Downs defender Wayne Arendse gave his side the opener with a tap-in in the 19th minute following a lapse of concentration by Chippa defenders who left him unmarked inside the penalty box.Arendse then conceded a penalty in the 37th minutes after referee Victor Gomes adjudged that he fouled Menzi Masuku. Chippa striker Rhulani Manzini made no mistake from the spot as he sent Sandilands the wrong way to the delight of the home crowd.
