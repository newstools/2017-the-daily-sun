We salute you for ensuring that all citizens are safe all the time,&rdquo; said Zuma, speaking at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.&nbsp; He gave medals to the doctors who took care of Nelson Mandela before his death in 2013.&nbsp; Soldiers who had displayed acts of bravery and who had served for many years also received medals.&nbsp; Despite the wet weather, about 2&thinsp;000 members of the SANDF and 200 vehicles took part in a parade attended by hundreds of people.&nbsp; Celiwe Dludla (34) said she felt safe after seeing the military vehicles that guard the borders of South Africa.&nbsp; Zuma also praised the men who died when the SS Mendi sank on 21 February 1917.&nbsp; The troop ship was carrying 616 black South Africans to serve in France in World War I when a cargo ship crashed into it and it sank in the English Channel.
