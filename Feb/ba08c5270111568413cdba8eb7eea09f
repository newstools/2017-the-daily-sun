WHEN a 24-year-old man asked Margaret Mashabala for 50c and she told him she didn&rsquo;t have it, she had no idea she was about to get a beating. The man allegedly got so angry that he started hitting the gogo with an umbrella! Gogo Margaret (74) from Kopanong in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said it was not the first time the man, who is now behind bars, had attacked her. &ldquo;He came to my house and asked for money. I didn&rsquo;t have 50c and he got very angry. He picked up an umbrella and hit me with it. &ldquo;His 57-year-old father tried to stop him but he was also beaten. We were tired of his behaviour and decided to call the police,&rdquo; she said. She said it was painful to see a boy she helped raise turning against her. &ldquo;I love him but he has caused the family pain. He makes problems for everyone &ndash; we cannot allow it to continue.&rdquo; Gogo Margaret said she sustained injuries to her head and mouth. Police spokesman Captain Manyadza Ralidzhivha confirmed that a case of assault was opened. He said the suspect will appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon.
