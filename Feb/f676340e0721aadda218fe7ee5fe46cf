THE African Diaspora Forum has condemned the recent attacks on foreigners. This comes after a march against illegal immigrants, organised by a group calling itself Mamelodi Concerned Residents, turned violent in Tshwane on Friday. The forum, an organisation for immigrants in South Africa, spoke at a joint press briefing with the United Front and the New Trade Union Federation in Joburg. Forum chairman Marc Gbaffou called for local and foreign communities to address the underlying causes of attacks on foreigners. He also said Home Affairs needs to stop its officials from engaging in bribery and corruption. Gbaffou produced a letter he wrote a month ago to President Jacob Zuma, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, Gauteng Premier David Makhura and acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane. In the letter, he urged them to publicly condemn violence against foreigners and warned them an attack was coming. United Front chairman Trevor Ngwane blamed Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba for sparking the hatred against foreigners. He said: &ldquo;Mashaba blamed the problems of Joburg on so-called illegal immigrants.&ldquo;Now he must take active steps to fight xenophobia. &ldquo;He must go to community meetings and raise awareness about the issue. &ldquo;The mayor must take steps to protect those under attack.&rdquo;
