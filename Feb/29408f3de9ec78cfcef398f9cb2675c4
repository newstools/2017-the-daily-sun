NATIONAL First Division side Jomo Cosmos are moving house again.Ezenkosi will from now on play their home matches at Tsakane Stadium in Brakpan &ndash; but might use Olen Park in Potchefstroom as alternative venue. Cosmos will play their first match at their new home ground tomorrow when they host struggling Milano United (3.30pm). Cosmos moved to Olen Park in the 2015-16 season after they were promoted to the Absa Premiership. Their coach, Jomo Sono, told SunSport that the main reason for their move to the East Rand was because of an unresolved dispute between the North West town&rsquo;s municipality and the Leopards rugby team, the current tenants of Olen Park.He stated: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get involved in the issue between the mayor and the rugby team. That is why the club decided to go back to the East Rand.&rdquo;Tsakane Stadium could become the long-term venue to host Ezenkosi&rsquo;s official games this season, including next month&rsquo;s Nedbank Cup Round of 32 clash with United Rovers FC.Sono is happy with the move, as it means they will be reunited with their old fans. &ldquo;The club have many fans there &ndash; Cosmos are an East Rand team. Our first match was played at Thokoza Stadium and we have also used Huntersfield Stadium in Katlehong,&rdquo; said Sono.Meanwhile, Ezenkosi are eyeing maximum points against Milano to keep their promotion hopes alive. Sono has accepted that Thanda Royal Zulu, who currently top the table, will most probably gain automatic promotion. He believes the race is still open for second and third place, the two promotion play-offs spots.He said: &ldquo;Anything is still possible, we will fight until the last day to make sure we make the play-offs.&rdquo;In tomorrow&rsquo;s other key fixures Thanda, who are undefeated in 16 league games, visit third placed Witbank Spurs at Puma Stadium in Mpumalanga, while second-placed Royal Eagles entertain another struggling Cape side, Cape Town All Stars, at Parow Park.
