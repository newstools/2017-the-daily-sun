AT FIRST, Lettie Maluleke found someone was deducting R150 from her grandchildren&rsquo;s grant money. After three months, the deduction more than doubled. The thief was helping himself to R500, leaving the gogo to make do with the remaining R1 050. Sassa officials did not have a clear answer for her. They claimed the deductions were for airtime and electricity, yet she never bought any on the card. The 53-year-old from Thembalethu, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga, struggled for three months to get answers from Sassa. But instead of the problem being solved, she found she was no longer getting any money on the Sassa cards, so she came to Daily Sun. Now, she will be getting R5 946!Lettie told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;All the officials could tell me was that someone was taking the money and buying airtime and electricity. They told me they could not stop the deductions. &ldquo;In December, all the money was taken. I don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore. The grant money was the only income keeping us alive. My grandchildren go to bed hungry. We survive on the mercy of our neighbours.&ldquo;They give us food and sometimes I get money from a mashonisa.&rdquo; Last week, Lettie went back to the Sassa office and an official told her she is no longer getting any money because she is paying debit orders. But Daily Sun discovered this is not true.Sassa spokesman Senzeni Ngobeni said they found Lettie last received payment in July. &ldquo;Her grant money is being paid to an Easy Pay card, which now has an amount of R5 946 available. We advise her to access her money on the card since she switched to it after borrowing R1 000.&rdquo;
