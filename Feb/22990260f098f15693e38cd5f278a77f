IT WAS after dark on Saturday when John Nkomo and his cousin &ndash; who were travelling with two other men &ndash; stopped for a pee on the N2 north.Suddenly they were ambushed by tsotsis wielding knives, and the two cousins ran off into the night to save themselves.It soon appeared that John, from Mandeni, northern KZN, had run straight into death&rsquo;s arms. He was apparently struck by a passing car and his decomposing body was found on Tuesday. He was lying on the grassy island between the busy highway&rsquo;s two lanes, near KwaMashu township.John&rsquo;s cousin Thembinkosi Buthelezi (45) said there were four of them in the car, and they were on their way to Ndengezi to visit a relative.&ldquo;We stopped on the side of the road to pee, just a few feet away from where John&rsquo;s body was found. &ldquo;Three hobos came out of nowhere and drew knives, demanding our cellphones. &ldquo;John and I ran in different directions and I ended up at the police station. The other two men were robbed of their belongings. After they were robbed, they drove off because they couldn&rsquo;t see where we had gone.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s other cousin, Sabelo Masinga (32), said the family searched frantically for John, and by Tuesday, they decided to report him missing.&ldquo;We went to Greenwood Park cop shop, where we were told that a man&rsquo;s body had been found on the highway and that cops were at the scene. Cops advised us to go there first before opening a case.&rdquo; Sabelo said his heart sank whey they found John, still in the same clothes he was wearing on the day he disappeared.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of culpable homicide was opened. &ldquo;Judging by the bruises on his body, it appears he was hit by a car and the side mirror of a car was found next to the body.&rdquo; Zwane appealed to anyone who may have information regarding the incident to call the cops.
