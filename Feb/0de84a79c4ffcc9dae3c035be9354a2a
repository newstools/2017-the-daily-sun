BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic players will not be resting on their laurels, even though their 2-0 victory over Chippa United has brought them a measure of relief. Celtic are still treading on dangerous ground, having only collected 18 points from 17 games, and are just five points ahead of bottom-placed Baroka FC.Siwelele captain Musa Nyatama, who scored a brace against Chippa, is not oblivious to the fact that there is still more work to do if they harbour ambitions of escaping relegation at the end of the season. &ldquo;We are not safe yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need to work hard and collect points, especially at home. We have been struggling with that in recent times. We need to turn the corner and make our supporters happy, as they have been there for us.&rdquo;The Daveyton-born player said the goals he scored at the weekend would boost their confidence and make them work harder. Celtic will have a few days to gather their strength as they prepare to host Platinum Stars at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in their next league match on Saturday.Nyatama said that although Stars had the busier schedule of the two, they would be a dangerous side to face. Dikwena returned from Mozambique on Sunday after their Caf Confederation Cup engagement and face African champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, tonight. Added Nyatama: &ldquo;Stars are also fighting for their lives in the league.&rdquo;
