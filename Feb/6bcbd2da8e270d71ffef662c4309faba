GOLDEN Arrows coach Clinton Larsen has came out in defence of his new recruit, Chiukepo Msowoya.Despite the former Orlando Pirates striker scoring an own-goal on his debut for Arrows yesterday, Larsen feels Msowoya needs more time before he starts scoring goals for the KZN-based club. Larsen believes Msowoya showed character in their 5-2 loss against SuperSport United at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday.Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende haven&rsquo;t won a league match since last year November when they narrowly edged out Highlands Park 1-0 at Makhulong Stadium.Regardless of the poor result, Arrows are still in the top eight with 20 points from 16 matches. Larsen said: &ldquo;If you looked at Msowoya&rsquo;s first-half performance, it was a good one. I can&rsquo;t speak for what other people are saying, but I look at the qualities he brings into the team.&rdquo;&ldquo;He really hustled upfront and gave SuperSport United&rsquo;s defence some real trouble. He gave us as much as he could. We&rsquo;ll try to create more chances for him and hopefully he&rsquo;ll score.&rdquo; Arrows will hope to turn things around on Saturday when they play relegation-threatened Bloemfontein Celtic in a league match at Princess Magogo Stadium.&nbsp;
