THE name &ldquo;Soweto On Sea&rdquo; evokes images of a blissful kasi near the ocean.Instead it has become a haven for mosquitoes and flies, because mountains of rubbish litter the street corners!Residents of the kasi in Port Elizabeth keep their windows and doors tightly closed to keep the insects out.Coupled with this is a mess created by blocked drains which causes kak to flow freely down the street.Residents claim Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has not collected rubbish since December, forcing them to dump their rubbish on plots of unused land and street corners.But municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki blamed residents who refuse to get up early to take their rubbish out when the refuse collection truck comes to the kasi.&ldquo;We collect rubbish on a weekly basis,&rdquo; he said.Gogo Nongazi Mazondo (66), who lives a few steps away from one such dumping site, said: &ldquo;At first only a few people threw their rubbish there after the municipality failed to collect it. &ldquo;But it soon became a dumping site filled with black bags of rubbish.&rdquo;The gogo said the rubbish is making her family sick.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t enjoy our food anymore because of the smell.&ldquo;I sent my grandchild to my sister in Motherwell because she has been falling sick ever since this rubbish started piling up outside our yard.&rdquo; Another resident, Mzwandile Ngobase (65), said he had confronted many residents who litter the kasi, &ldquo;but they just keep on dumping their rubbish everywhere.&ldquo;We thought the new mayor, Athol Trollip, would improve service delivery.&ldquo;We end up burning the rubbish, but that pollutes the air. &ldquo;We have complained about this, but all our cries have fallen on deaf ears,&rdquo; he said.Litter and dumping by-laws allow for fines of between R1 000 and R2 000, Mniki said.&ldquo;We will enforce this by-law to ensure residents stop dumping rubbish illegally. It affects the well-being of others.&rdquo;
