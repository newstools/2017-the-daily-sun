Thamsanqa Mbelu from Bulwer, in the KZN Midlands said Friday was his pay day. He said after receiving notification on his phone, he noticed that his salary was R400 short. &ldquo;I confronted my boss about this but he got angry and pulled out a gun. He then started shooting at me and I took cover,&rdquo; claimed Thamsanqa. The 60-year-old, a truck driver at a company based in Durban, said his problems started on Thursday when he was injured while loading a truck. &ldquo;I told my boss and he told me to go and see a doctor. When I came back the following day he demanded a doctor&rsquo;s certificate, which I didn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; said Thamsanqa.He said he didn&rsquo;t ask the doctor for the letter because his boss had never asked for one in the past.&ldquo;But I promised to get it on Saturday. I thought he understood but later I saw that my salary was short.&rdquo; Thamsanqa&rsquo;s boss confirmed that he worked at his company as a truck driver. &ldquo;Sorry, I won&rsquo;t comment further on this matter as it is in the hands of the police,&rdquo; he said.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that a case of attempted murder has been opened. &ldquo;A 60-year-old man was almost shot by a known suspect.
