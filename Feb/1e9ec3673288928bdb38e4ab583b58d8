AS SOON as the sound of wedding bells disappears in the distance, many Mzansi women find they have landed in the prison of a loveless marriage.But while their marriages might be unhappy, it apparently doesn&rsquo;t mean their sex lives should be sad too. This comes after South African members of the discreet cheating network, Victoria Milan, spilled the beans on their tangos between the sheets! The most surprising finding of the survey is that a skirt lifting 71% of female respondents would jump in the sack on their first illicit date.The adult affair website conducted a survey on the topic, asking 5 650 of its actively cheating female members just how many dates it took before they would poke a new lover, as well as the saucy details on where and why.Most cheating Mzansi women said their first choice of venue would be to sleep together at a hotel (61%), followed by 31% who preferred to go to a date&rsquo;s place.The best way to get a first date past dessert, according to the majority of the survey sample, was as easy as being extra attentive (53%). The tactic least likely to work is getting drunk &ndash; getting the cheater a one-way ticket home alone. The founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, said the data showed that women cheaters knew what they wanted &ndash; and how to get it.&ldquo;Our cheaters love to have adulterous adventures and don&rsquo;t waste time seducing their lovers. It&rsquo;s common for first-date dalliances to end between the sheets &ndash; and this study reveals where and how it&rsquo;s going to happen.&rdquo; Victoria Milan collected and analysed data via online surveys, and ensured that all possible measures were in place to protect members&rsquo; identities and privacy.
