KAIZER Chiefs started the second round of the Absa Premiership on a high following their 3-1 victory against relegation threatened Freestate Stars at FNB stadium on Wednesday night. Chiefs, who ended the first round of the PSL campaign with two wins in a row, continued from where they left-off when Siphiwe Tshabalala, Bernard Parker and Willard Katsande converted to give &nbsp;Amakhosi the much needed three points. Steve Komphela&rsquo;s charges are now on third position on the log with 27 points from 16 games.It was in the 18th minute when former Ea Lla Koto star Tshabalala broke the ice with a stunning freekick from range to beat goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni and give Chiefs a 1-0 lead. The visiting side played their first match under new coach Serame Letsoaka, who replaced Italian Giovanni Solinas after his contract was terminated early last month. However, Ea Lla Koto didn&rsquo;t look like a team that is facing relegation and wanted to get out of the danger position.Chiefs were all over Stars and they were rewarded with a penalty when Ngobeni fouled Edmore Chirambadare inside the box and Parker doubled the score for Chiefs to make it 2-0 before halftime. It could have been three goals in favour of Chiefs before halftime, however, Chirambadare failed to control the ball on a one-one position with Ngobeni.Katsande scored the third on a set piece after Stars defenders failed to clear the ball.Chiefs have not lost a league match to Stars since the 2010-11 season. As Stars were looking to come back into the game, they were awarded with a free kick outside Chiefs&rsquo; penalty box and on his debut Rooi Mahamutsa beat Itumeleng Khune with a grass cutter to give Stars a hope of coming back into the game but it was too little too late.&nbsp;
