LEADERS must think twice before making statements that could stir violence, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba warned.&ldquo;It could very well make one popular to make irresponsible statements that provoke vigilantism and South African communities taking the law into their own hands,&rdquo; the minister said yesterday at the Yeoville Police Station in Joburg.He said leaders must be responsible about what they say because lives could be lost. &ldquo;Property that belongs to individuals could be destroyed and they would have invested a lot in its development and maintenance,&rdquo; he said.Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba has been under fire for the statements he made about illegal immigrants in Joburg.Following the recent violence in Rosettenville, Gigaba and community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the area for a public meeting.Ten houses, believed to have been used for prostitution and drug dealing, were set alight at the weekend.Earlier, the minister and MEC went to Yeoville, Hillbrow and Mayfair, areas seen as hot spots for drugs and prostitution.Gigaba said the aim was to ensure peace and stability. They also wanted to visit areas that have regular flare-ups and speak to both South African and immigrant communities in the areas.&ldquo;To manage migration, we can&rsquo;t only talk to immigrants. We must speak to South Africans as well.&rdquo;The minister also gave an update on illegal immigrants that have been deported. He said between 2014 and 2015, about 10 000 people were detained as they tried to enter the country&rsquo;s borders illegally.&ldquo;Some are successful in getting into the country, but large numbers of them are prevented and sent back to their countries.&rdquo;Gigaba added that the department of home affairs deports thousands of illegal immigrants annually.
