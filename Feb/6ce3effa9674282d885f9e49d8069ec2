ZIMBABWEAN international Danny Phiri has proven to be the link that have been missing from Golden Arrows in the past season. The midfielder joined Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende at the beginning of the season from Zimbabwe champions Chicken Inn and has easily adapted to Arrows&rsquo; playing style. He&rsquo;s been tasked with all the dirty work in the middle of the park, allowing a free role for Musa Bilankulu or Kagisho Dikgacoi. Phiri feels, however, that he has yet to reach his full potential and is still learning the ropes with Arrows. He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first season at Arrows, so I can&rsquo;t really say if I&rsquo;m doing well or not. All I know is I&rsquo;m new to South African football. This season is a learning curve for me.&rdquo;He promised to keep working hard until he becomes a force to be reckoned with. The 27-year-old helped Arrows to sixth position in the first round of the Absa Premiership. He said for the club to consolidate their top eight position they would need to be consistent in their 12 remaining matches. Arrows have won only one match of three played in the second round. They face Chippa United at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane, East London, tomorrow (8pm).He said: &ldquo;Consistency has been a problem for us and we need to change that. Teams are doubling their efforts and we should start doing the same. Our home games should be must-wins for us, no excuses.&rdquo; Regarding the match against the Chilli Boys, he said: &ldquo;There is a real need for us to win. &ldquo;They are a tough nut to crack at home but we&rsquo;re also determined to come back with the three points.
