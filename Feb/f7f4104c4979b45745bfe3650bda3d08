TRAFFIC in a large part of the Joburg CDB came to a standstill for a few hours yesterday. This was after members of the Nancefield Dube West Taxi Association parked their minibuses in such a way that motorists couldn&rsquo;t pass.It caused chaos as motorists tried to find alternative routes, only to find them blocked as well.A taxi owner told Daily Sun they decided on this action to show their anger with the Witwatersrand African Taxi Association. &ldquo;They disobeyed a court judgment ordering them to withdraw their taxis from the Dube route,&rdquo; the taxi owner said. &ldquo;They are not supposed to stop at ranks on our route, but they&rsquo;re doing it. They park their taxis and wait for them to get full. We lose business on the route that is meant to be ours.&rdquo; The department of roads and transport condemned the Nancefield Dube Association&rsquo;s blockade of the streets.The department&rsquo;s statement said it viewed the action as unfortunate, given that the department and the two associations have had meetings to find common ground in resolving the dispute.Colonel Martin Mhlaba from Joburg Central SAPS said the drivers spoke to officials from the department and later moved their minibuses without any violence.The associations were not available for comment.
