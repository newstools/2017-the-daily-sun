SOME people feel unwanted when they are single. But that feeling could change during the Khwezela Singles Conference.The annual conference was founded by Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule and her husband Bishop Mpendulo Nkambule.It started as a TV show which aired on SABC 1 in 2011. Now the conference tours all over Mzansi. Wendy Sithole, Mbokazi-Nkambule&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said the conference also appeals to married couples. &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s focus is on single people and unmarried couples.&rdquo;The conference will take place at Nicole Square Building in Durban next Saturday and at the City Hall in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands, next Sunday.&ldquo;Single people will get the chance to ask various questions that will be answered by Mbokazi-Nkambule and her husband. &ldquo;They will get ideas on how to stay happy while single. Sometimes people think being single is a bad thing. I can assure you that they will leave the conference thinking differently.&rdquo; She said last year the conference only took place in Joburg. &ldquo;But the demand from other provinces forced the organisers to plan a tour.&rdquo;Wendy said Mbokazi-Nkambule, who is also a founder of the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards, and her husband wrote a book called Before The Vows, before getting married in 2011.&ldquo;The book tackles relationship issues, including challenges that unmarried couples face. But it also gives advice on how to deal with those challenges.&rdquo;
