&ldquo;MY SON, I release you to the heavens.&rdquo;These were the brave words of devastated mum Bhekiswa Mabude, speaking at her murdered son&rsquo;s funeral.The skies opened and rain poured down yesterday as the community of Nkantolo filled the Mabude home in Mbizana to say goodbye to 14-year-old Vusumzi.The teenager was found dead in a pit toilet on his school&rsquo;s premises last Friday. It happened after he had disappeared a week earlier.Vusumzi&rsquo;s young life came to a painful end on 3 February, when he was strangled to death before being stuffed into the toilet.Speaking to mourners who included police, municipal and ANC officials, mum Bhekiswa shared her horrific week when she was led to believe that her first-born child had been kidnapped for a ransom of R6 000.&ldquo;I could not eat. When I slept I would wake up, worried where you were. Your killers have ripped me apart and destroyed me. &ldquo;I was at their mercy all those days but still had hope you would come home safe and alive.&ldquo;My tears have run dry. But I am letting you go my child.&rdquo;Today, a family member will apply for bail with two youths who were all charged with kidnapping and killing Vusumzi.&ldquo;While we were busy running up and down losing our minds looking for you, my son, the woman who shared your blood laughed at us,&rdquo; the heartbroken mum shared with mourners. &ldquo;We suspected her for the longest time because she hated you. She hated me and she hated your father. &ldquo;She hated that your name meant &lsquo;he who will rebuild the home&rsquo;.&ldquo;I was building a new home for us while your father worked in Joburg so we could all live in peace.&rdquo;
