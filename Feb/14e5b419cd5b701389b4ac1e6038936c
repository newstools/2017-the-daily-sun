THERE is a new positive vibe at Free State Stars! The new optimism at the Bethlehem-based outfit since the start of the second round of the Absa Premiership earlier this month stems from the arrival of a number of players in the January transfer window.This includes two top strikers in Mohammed Anas and Allen Nono from Gabon.Also beefing up the squad are defenders Thabang Matuka (Bloemfontein Celtic), Simphiwe Mtsweni (Chippa United) while midfielder Nhlakanipho Ntuli joins ex-Pirates teammates Rooi Mahamutsa and Thamsanqa Teyise, who have bolstered the Stars defence since arriving in December.New coach Serame Letsoaka has played his part too, according to Ea Lla Koto general manager Rantsi Mokoena.&ldquo;Everything has come together for us at the moment,&rdquo; said Mokoena. &ldquo;The January break did us a world of good and the return from pre-season injuries of Congo international keeper Christoffer Mafoumbi and left wing Sinetemba Jantjie has done wonders for the club. We now have two quality keepers while Jantjie has been a revelation in our last two games.&rdquo;Mokoena was confident they would steer clear of the relegation zone, but stressed that their next two matches against Maritzburg United (on Sunday) and relegation candidates Highlands Park (on 5 March) would be crucial.Said Mokoena: &ldquo;Six points from Maritzburg away and Highlands in Orkney will be like gold. If we win those two I believe we might even be contenders for the top eight. But should we lose we&rsquo;ll be back fighting for our lives.&rdquo;Mokoena said that despite their 3-1 loss to leaders Kaizer Chiefs in their opening second round match this month, it was the turning point. Stars have since drawn 0-0 against title chasing SuperSport United and beaten Golden Arrows 1-0 in Durban to move out of the relegation zone.Said Mokoena: &ldquo;Despite losing I saw hope and optimism for the club. The new players and those who have come back from injury have injected new life into the squad. &ldquo;New coach Serame has fitted in and I believe we have a strong enough squad to compete pound for pound in the second round.&rdquo;
