THAMI RAMNCWANE saw Sphiwe Zwane&rsquo;s story in the People&rsquo;s Paper two weeks ago and immediately decided to speak to his boss. &ldquo;I was so touched. When I showed the article to my boss, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate and I called Daily Sun.&rdquo;Sphiwe, from Phumula in Ekurhuleni, was born with deformed legs and had to have them amputated.&ldquo;This boy is still young,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He needs to play with other kids without any inhibition.&rdquo;Pretorius de Muelenaere owns Pretorius De Muelenaere and Associates in Tshwane, where he works. The SunTeam took Sphiwe and his mum, Phumzile Nkambule, to his workplace.De Muelenaere told Sphiwe&rsquo;s mum: &ldquo;The good news is that he can balance and use his stumps. I&rsquo;m happy.&rdquo;De Muelenaere said he would ask Ossur, a company that makes prosthetics, to make the limbs and his company would sponsor the sockets. He said he will do his best to get the boy a long-term sponsor. He also promised to make running blades for the little boy.Sphiwe said he wanted sockets in Orlando Pirates colours.&ldquo;I thank Daily Sun for giving us the opportunity to help the little boy,&rdquo; said De Muelenaere.The emotional mum said she was so happy.&ldquo;I feel like screaming. I can see the light now.&rdquo; The new legs will last about 18 months and Sphiwe will need new ones as he keeps on growing. The new legs will be delivered in a few weeks&rsquo; time.
