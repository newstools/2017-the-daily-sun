WHEN people saw her bloodied body after she was beaten and stabbed seven times, they thought she was dead. But tavern owner Emily Mthimunye (44), from Leeufontein, Mpumalanga survived the attack. The incident happened last month when she was attacked and stabbed, allegedly by her lover. She said she was asleep in her bedroom when her boyfriend attacked her. She fled to the tavern, but the man allegedly caught her and the beating began. She was finally rescued by neighbours.&ldquo;My boyfriend left, but immediately came back with a knife and stabbed me seven times. I lost consciousness and woke up later lying in a pool of blood.&ldquo; But when I heard his voice outside telling people that he came back to finish me off, my will to live took over and I crawled to the toilet.&rdquo; Emily said she found a container full of acid in the toilet and armed herself with it. When her lover opened the toilet door, she threw it in his face. &ldquo;I could hear his screams,&rdquo; she said. Captain Zandile Gxawa said a case of assault was opened against the boyfriend, who opened the same case in return. &ldquo;No arrests have been made as we are waiting for both complainants to fully recover.&rdquo;
