&ldquo;YOU know my killers and if I don&rsquo;t get justice, you won&rsquo;t sleep!&rdquo; Isaac Chabalala claimed these were the words of his late brother, Steven Chabalala, who was stabbed and burnt in his shack in Atteridgeville. The 47-year-old from Maboloka in North West saidfor five years he has not slept properly.&ldquo;I know who killed my brother but the police are not doing anything,&rdquo; said Isaac.He claims that every night at midnight, Steven comes and fights.&ldquo;Sometimes he comes, looks at me, shakes his head and spreads his arms. I don&rsquo;t know what that means but he doesn&rsquo;t look happy.&rdquo; He added that his girlfriend thinks he is crazy. &ldquo;Whenever she comes to sleep over and I talk to Steven, she thinks I am hallucinating,&rdquo; he said. He said his brother is making his life hell. &ldquo;I wake up tired because I don&rsquo;t get enough sleep. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get a job and I am afraid my girlfriend will leave me.&rdquo; Isaac said he went to see a sangoma but it didn&rsquo;t end his suffering.Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said Isaac must do a ritual to lay Steven&rsquo;s spirit to rest but he must also make sure the police know who killed his brother.Police spokesman Captain Thomas Mofumadi said a case of arson was opened and the matter is still being investigated.
