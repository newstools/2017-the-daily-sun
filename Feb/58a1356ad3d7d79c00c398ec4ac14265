SLINDOKUHLE Shabalala (12), from Snathing in Pietermaritzburg, KZN Midlands has shown no signs of improvement since he was admitted to Edendale Hospital two weeks ago.His mum, Thandeka Shabalala (42), said her son has burn wounds all over his body.This happened after he allegedly took medication prescribed to him for epileptic fits by a local doctor at the beginning of last month. Thandeka said she suspects the medication has side effects that caused an allergic reaction.&ldquo;I think he did not give himself enough time to examine my son and make sure the medication he prescribed wouldn&rsquo;t cause any problems.&rdquo; She claimed the doctor promised to visit her son last Monday, but did not do so.&ldquo;I would have appreciated that because we would have talked face to face and seen whether anything can be done to help save my son from the pain he is going through.&rdquo;She said her son&rsquo;s condition worsens every day.&ldquo;He is now unable to speak and his vision has also been affected.&rdquo; When Daily Sun contacted the doctor, he said: &ldquo;Please allow me not to say anything.&rdquo;Then he hung up.KZN Health spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said: &ldquo;The department would like to state it is not government policy to discuss the clinical information of a patient with a third party unless it is required by law. These third parties include the media.&rdquo;
