AFTER nearly four months without a head coach, Orlando Pirates have finally revealed the name of their next mentor.On Monday, club chairperson Irvin Khoza announced that 54-year-old Swede Kjell Jonevret will be the new head coach of the Buccaneers.The 54-year-old hails from Sweden and has previously coached Molde FK and Viking FK."I would like to say that I know SA football fantastically well. But I have been down here to watch a few games," said Jonevret at the press conference in Joburg."I&rsquo;m looking forward to this a lot and it will be fantastic. I am really honoured to be standing here."It took a 6-0 league defeat against Mamelodi Sundowns and disgruntled fans to display their unhappiness in no uncertain terms, for Khoza to last week confirm that a new coach would be named.Buccaneers' fans at Loftus Versfeld halted the match against Sundowns in the 82nd minute by taking to the field of play.Players and technical staff rushed towards the tunnel for safety as the match was brought to a premature end.However, the match resumed after it took nearly an hour to bring calm to the situation.In November last year, Muhsin Ertugral opted to jump ship after SuperSport United handed the Buccaneers a 6-1 hiding.The former Ajax Cape Town coach announced on live television in his post-match interview that he would hand in his resignation.Khoza went on to say that the club were in search for someone who will educate the players and not give up as soon as the going gets tough."We hope that the new coach has new ways that he can show us. We want coaches who are tutors not traitors," said Khoza."Coaches are like an arranged marriage, you go for the best."He will be introduced soon after this to the rest of the technical team."I think the most important thing is to improve the player's confidence and to stabilise the team."The Buccaneers next fixture is against Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash.Kick-off is at 3.30pm on Saturday 25 February.&nbsp;http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/pirates-shock-with-little-known-swede-as-new-coach-20170220
