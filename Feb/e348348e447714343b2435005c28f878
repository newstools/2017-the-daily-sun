WHEN thugs attacked and burnt down the Masilo family&rsquo;s RDP house, all Gopolang could take with her was her identity document. Gopolang Masilo (27) from Moeka Village near Hammanskraal, north of Tshwane said she was woken up by gunshots outside her house on Saturday.Six armed men knocked on her door and said they were looking for her boyfriend.&ldquo;One of the men had a 5-litre container full of petrol. When I told them my boyfriend was not around they didn&rsquo;t believe me. &ldquo;They immediately broke the windows and poured petrol inside the house.&rdquo;Gopolang said she was with her sister and her two children when the incident happened.&ldquo;They wanted to burn us but I begged them to let us go.&rdquo; Gopolang said she was relieved when they let them out, but she realised she had forgotten something important in the house.&ldquo;I had to beg them to let me take my ID. One of the men shouted at me, but eventually let me back in before setting the house on fire. &ldquo;I watched helplessly as my house was burnt to ashes. It felt like a nightmare but there was nothing I could do because I feared for our lives.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost everything. My children and my ID are all I have left.&rdquo; She said she still fears for their safety because she still does not know what the men wanted from her boyfriend.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if those men will come back and I wonder what they have against my boyfriend because he is a good man. He would not hurt a fly.&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said a case of arson has been opened.&ldquo;No arrests have yet been made.&rdquo;
