A LEFTFIELD appointment 12 months ago, Belgian Hugo Broos has overcome numerous obstacles and transformed Cameroon into a team just one match away from winning the Africa Cup of Nations.Before going to Gabon, Cameroon were dismissed as no-hopers, their squad arguably the weakest they had ever sent to a Cup of Nations.But after coming through their group at the expense of the hosts and beating Senegal on penalties in the last eight, the Indomitable Lions beat Ghana 2-0 in Franceville on Thursday to set up a completely unexpected final date against Egypt tonight. &ldquo;This team came here and nobody believed in them. If you told someone before the tournament we would get to the final they would have laughed, but this for us was a big motivation,&rdquo; said Broos. His players are glowing in their praise of Broos, citing improved discipline and a feeling of squad unity that had not been there previously. He has even spoken out in their defence amid a row over bonus payments.A lack of experience was expected to hinder Cameroon &ndash; Broos points out that 14 of his squad had never previously been to the Cup of Nations.Meanwhile Broos insists that &ldquo;the door is always open&rdquo; for those who refused to come to Gabon. &ndash; AFP
