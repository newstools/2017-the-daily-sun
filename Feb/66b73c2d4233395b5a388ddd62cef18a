They said it had saved my life because it stopped the bleeding. &ldquo;At the time of the attack, I was travelling with two friends to Westonaria, Gauteng, when the driver stopped the car and ordered me to get out.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember much after that. It was dark and I was walking alone on the highway. &ldquo;All I can recall is that I was hit very hard on the back of the head.Then I heard my gogo calling me.&ldquo;Every time I wake up, I hug this blanket. It puts a smile on my face. Had it not been for this blanket, I would have died.&rdquo;He added that the blanket had given him courage and that he now believes in miracles.&ldquo;I want to meet the owner of the blanket and share meat and drinks with him or her,&rdquo; he said.Mzwandile&rsquo;s brother, Thami Maxeke (48), told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I am appealing to the owner to come forward.
