THEY built their shacks and called the place Silver City although there is nothing shiny about their lives.Silver City, near A section in Umlazi, south of Durban is next to a graveyard and the squatters complain they are being haunted by ghosts from the graves. The shacks were erected in 2014 and only a concrete fence separates them from the cemetery.The residents claim they hear strange noises and people speaking in languages they don&rsquo;t understand, while others say the ghosts have tried to strangle them.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried holy water and muthi from various sangomas but nothing helps,&rdquo; said resident Nonhlanhla Khuboni (29).&ldquo;I came from Ladysmith to look for a job,&rdquo; said Mphumuzeni Dlamini (32). &ldquo;Three days after building my shack I heard people talking but I couldn&rsquo;t understand the language.&ldquo;Then I heard something pushing my door open. I didn&rsquo;t see anything but then I felt a big hand trying to strangle me. It happened for a few minutes and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep the whole night,&rdquo; claimed Mphumuzeni.He said he consulted sangomas but the muthi they gave him to sprinkle before going to bed didn&rsquo;t help.Nokuzola Thabethe (36) claimed ghosts forced her to take her five-year-old boy back to Pietermaritzburg.&ldquo;My child was having sleepless nights because of evil things in my shack,&rdquo; claimed Nokuzola.Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said the ghosts might be angry that the shacks are so near their graves.
