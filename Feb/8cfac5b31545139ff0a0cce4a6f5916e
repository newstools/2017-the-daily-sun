NONTSIKILELO says her panties and skirt were torn and her hair was pulled all for handing in incomplete application forms. Nontsikilelo Tapuka (34) from Small Farms, Orange Farm, south of Joburg, was dropping off her four-year-old son at a creche earlier this month when she claims the incident took place. I gave them an incomplete application form because I was looking for another creche for my son. I gave them a copy of my ID and promised to bring the rest of the documents when I knocked off from work. But she claims a teacher followed her, demanding she leave with her son. She kicked my son out of class and pushed me against the wall. When she fought back, five more women came out and attacked her. Nontsikelelo claims the woman stripped her of her panties and punched her.When she went to open a case at Sebokeng Police Station she was sent to the doctor. Police then arrived at the hospital and arrested her for assault. The principal opened a case before I could. Principal Sanah Samuel said denied that she touched Nontsikelelo. She started the fight. No one beat her up. I didn t even touch her. I gave her enough time to hand in the forms. Her child had been at my creche for a month. Parents are required to provide their kid s information in case of an emergency. Captain Teboho Laphoto of Sebokeng Police Station said two cases of assault have been opened.
