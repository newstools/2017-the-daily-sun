IT IS easy to say that you must take care of your own wellbeing . . . but what is self-care? What does it mean? Self-care is about looking after the person who runs your life: work, play, relationships, family and all the things you enjoy &ndash; that person is YOU! According to Nicola Brink, executive director for the Self-Medication Manufacturers Association of South Africa, self-care is all the things you do daily to deal with minor or long-term health conditions.&nbsp; &ldquo;These include healthy lifestyle choices such as eating cleanly or avoiding smoking, responsible use of medicines regarding dosage, storage and disposal, knowing when you need to see a doctor or pharmacist, and monitoring or even managing your and your loved ones&rsquo; wellbeing,&rdquo; said Brink. You&rsquo;ve probably heard the alarming statistic from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that non-communicable diseases like heart disease, stroke and diabetes are currently the leading causes of mortality. The WHO said that 80% of these diseases could be prevented by self-care and would lead to:&nbsp; -&thinsp; A longer life expectancy&nbsp; -&thinsp;Improved wellness -&thinsp;Higher self-esteem -&thinsp; A reduced burden on our private and public healthcare services&nbsp; Inspired by Healthy Lifestyle Awareness Day, the manufacturer&rsquo;s association shared some basic self-care steps: Get some insight&nbsp; The first step is self-assessment. Be honest with yourself about your health. Are you getting the right treatment for your health problems?

According to webmd.com, there are four ways to manage stress:&nbsp; -&thinsp; Write: In a journal, spend 10 to 15 minutes a day noting the details of stressful events and how they made you feel.&nbsp; -&thinsp; Talk: Laugh, cry or vent with friends or family members.&nbsp; -&thinsp; Breathe: Inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth while counting to 10. Repeat for five or 10 minutes. -&thinsp; Hobbies: Do gardening, painting, reading, playing with pets, or whatever it is you love doing. Sleep hygiene&nbsp; Schedule a relaxing activity before bed. Switch off bright lights and electronic devices. This separates sleep time from activities that are stressful whether they cause excitement or anxiety &ndash; all of which ruin deep, restful sleep.
