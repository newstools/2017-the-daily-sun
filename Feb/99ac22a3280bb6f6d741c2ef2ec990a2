RESIDENTS of Switch, near Mothutlung, North West are fed up with their local sewerage plant.They do not have proper sanitation facilities in their area, and are exposed to the kak that flows from the dysfunctional plant.The plant is filled with sewage pumped from Mothutlung.On Tuesday, the residents barricaded the entrance to the park with burning tyres. They said the plant will remain closed until municipal officials come to the area to address the problem.Salome Mabaso, a resident, said the plant has not worked since last year but nothing is being done about it.&ldquo;We had meetings with municipal officials in November and December. &ldquo;They promised to come back last month but they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.She said their ward councillor, Nomsa Maqaicamba, always reports their problems to the municipality, but her pleas keep falling on deaf ears.&ldquo;She is trying her best, but they are not assisting her.&rdquo;Maqaicamba said the plant was inspected.&ldquo;The municipality hired people to repair the plant, but residents turned them away. &ldquo;They wanted to be hired to do the job.&ldquo;I am appealing to residents to let the municipal workers fix the problem so everyone can live in peace.&rdquo;
