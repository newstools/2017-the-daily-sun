Golden Arrows host Free State Stars in a Premiership clash at the Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday aiming to win successive matches for the first time since September.Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende have seen their season going somewhat south after their impressive start to the campaign that saw them top the standings in October.They ended a seven-game winless streak by beating Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 last weekend, much to the relief of their coaching staff.&ldquo;It was a big relief and it has helped lift the mood at training this week,&rdquo; said assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi. &ldquo;Hopefully we can now capitalise.&ldquo;Free State Stars are a dangerous side and they have been on the wrong end of many close games this season. They are also coached by Serame Letsoaka, who was in charge here not so long ago.&rdquo;Chiukepo Msowoya is missing for Arrows after his red card in the last game.Stars, meanwhile, are third from bottom on the standings, just a point ahead of Highlands Park in 15th.The men from Bethlehem, who are yet to win a game this year, are set to welcome back Paulus Masehe after a thigh injury, which had sidelined him for more than three months.But Thokozani Sekotlong and Nhlakanipho Ntuli are still on the casualty list.
