Whether it&rsquo;s Friday at the office, you&rsquo;re spending the whole day on campus or just hanging out with friends, dressing super casual is the norm.&nbsp; A few years ago we saw plain t-shirts became the hottest trend in casual wear and now it&rsquo;s printed T-shirts.&nbsp; But not just any printed T-shirt, these t-shirts are funny, silly, sarcastic and random.&nbsp; Find prints of fruit, cartoons or emoji&rsquo;s for a fun element, or if you&rsquo;re a bit random, deep thought provoking, find t-shirts with quotes on them, there really is such a huge variety to match your personality.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re looking for something unique and specific and are a bit creative, you can make your own printed t-shirt. &nbsp;Getting a plain t-shirt printed costs as little as +/-R20.&nbsp; So now because of printed t-shirts there&rsquo;s no reason why your personality cannot shine through your casual wear this year.&nbsp;
