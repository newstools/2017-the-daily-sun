The Dolphin Coast Taxi Association, which operates in the area, supported the decision. Mayor Ricardo Mthembu said the temporary rank will be funded by the municipality and there is budget available. &ldquo;The temporary facility will be built at the permanent site while we are finalising the detailed design for the taxi rank. &ldquo;R3 million from our reserves will be used to open access roads, level the site, build a stormwater system and pay for engineering costs.&rdquo; Mthembu said the Ballito Taxi Rank is one of the projects sent for registration through the municipal infrastructure grant. He added that the permanent taxi rank project will be budgeted for during the 2017/18 financial year. &ldquo;The draft budget that will be adopted by council before 31 March will have the final figure for the project.&ldquo;The municipal manager will be finalising the appointment of the contractor before the end of this week.&ldquo;A contractor will be appointed to deal with the building of the temporary taxi rank.&rdquo; Mthembu stressed that his municipality has inherited towns, like Ballito, that were not designed with public transport facilities.
