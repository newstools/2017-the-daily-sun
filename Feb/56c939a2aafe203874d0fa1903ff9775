DURBAN radio station, Gagasi FM, is allegedly in turmoil.This after claims that three of its top DJs are serving notice.They are said to be Felix Hlophe of The Jumpstart, Kini Shandu of The Big Bang and sports presenter, Simtho Dladla.A source at the station alleged: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that Gagasi FM is losing popular DJs because of a lack of leadership skills. &ldquo;The three were good at what they were doing and were the station&rsquo;s cash cows.&ldquo;They brought in lots of advertisers and revenue was good.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s sad is that management also refused to accept their resignation letters,&rdquo; the source said.Another source claimed the trio was unhappy about station manager Vukile Zondi.The allegations went on: &ldquo;Everything is falling apart. DJ Vumar was the first victim when management decided to replace him with DJ Le Soul. This despite lower audience figures.&ldquo;Management is also threatening to take legal action against Kini for resigning to join SABC1&rsquo;s new talk show called Daily Thetha,&rdquo; the source claimed.Another mole told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;This is very scary because some of our advertisers have threatened to pull out, if they don&rsquo;t fix their house.&ldquo;Customers want answers as to why three prominent members of the station have resigned.&rdquo;Kini refused to comment when the SunTeam contacted him &ndash; and referred the paper to the station&rsquo;s manager, Vukile Zondi.Both Vukile and Felix could not be reached for comment.They also failed to respond to our SMSes at the time of going to press.
