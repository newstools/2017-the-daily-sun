WHILE the process of appointing a new Bafana Bafana coach remains shrouded in mystery, another name has been thrown into the hat.SunSport understands that Burkina Faso&rsquo;s Paulo Duarte has also shown interest in the job, putting his hand up barely two months before Bafana&rsquo;s friendly against a still-to-be-decided west African team at the end of March.Duarte&rsquo;s name is the latest on a long list of reported contenders, which includes Milutin &ldquo;Micho&rdquo; Sredejovic, Avram Grant, Herve Renard, Claude le Roy and Carlos Quieroz. Rod Hodgson and Grant are believed to be too old for the job, with Quieroz, Duarte, Sredejovic and Renard are front runners for the Bafana hot seat. According to SA Football Association (Safa) president, Danny Jordaan, the answer to the Bafana coach question will be provided at the end of this month after an executive committee meeting.Acknowledging the ongoing speculation on the next coach, Jordaan said they would go for someone credible with vast experience and a good track record.Speaking to SunSport from Port-Gentil, Jordaan made it clear that money would not be an issue in appointing a new coach, as Safa wants someone who will turn Bafana&rsquo;s' fortunes around.&ldquo;We must urgently get a coach,&rdquo; he said, also indicating that people just had to be patient until the end of the month.&ldquo;People need success. We must make sure Bafana are a great success. Contracts and money are subject to negotiation.&ldquo;We need someone with a credible record at club and national team level. A great number of highly qualified coaches have shown interest in this job,&rdquo; Jordaan said.&ldquo;We have been paying good salaries and can&rsquo;t be deterred from appointing a good coach because of money.&rdquo;Jordaan indicated that some of the coaches interested in taking over at Bafana were still in Gabon, such as Duarte, whose Burkina Faso side were knocked out of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) 4-3 on penalties by Egypt after a 1-1 stalemate in Libreville, Gabon, on Wednesday.&ldquo;CVs have been submitted but we have not discussed any of them. We cannot be seen talking to coaches who are still under contract.&ldquo;We have not spoken to any of the coaches but many have shown interest in coaching South Africa.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Fifa president Gianni Infantino is expected to visit Safa House before the end of this month, where he will have a meeting with the Safa leadership, as well as with Tokyo Sexwale.
