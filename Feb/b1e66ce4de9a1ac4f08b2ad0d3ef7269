MZANSI&rsquo;S movie State Enemy Number 1 is now allegedly Actor&rsquo;s Enemy Number 1.&nbsp;This follows a tip-off from some of the actors that producer, Elvis Nkosi, has not paid them. Several sources in the cast claim that Nkosi has been singing the late Brenda Fassie&rsquo;s song, Promises, for almost seven weeks. And they are now sick of it.&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been paid since we started shooting the movie, and we&rsquo;ve been given promises with no deadlines at all.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re creatives and this is how we make our living,&rdquo; said one of the angry actors.When Sunday Sun asked Metro FM&rsquo;s Pearl Modiadie, who is in the cast, she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I really can&rsquo;t comment on that.&rdquo;&nbsp;Elvis admitted to the People&rsquo;s Paper that some of the actors had not been paid.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still shooting. To see who have not received payment, I&rsquo;ll have to look into the books and what each contract says about payment,&rdquo; Elvis said.He said he spoke with lead actors personally and they knew when to expect payments due to them.&ldquo;Challenges are there and people need to understand that funds are coming from different sources, who pay at different times,&rdquo; he said.A Sunday Sun source has revealed that some of the crew members have since left &ndash; and others are threatening to leave the movie should the issue of payment not be resolved on time.But Elvis denied that some actors have left, saying: &ldquo;I had to fire some crew members because they took cars and went out drinking.&rdquo;An actor said: &ldquo;Recently, we had a meeting with the producer, who promised to make payments soon. But he didn&rsquo;t give us an exact date. This meeting was after the crew decided to down tools.&rdquo;Elvis admitted the meeting took place, but denied allegations that his crew has gone on strike.Another frustrated actor, told Sunday Sun Elvis is a &ldquo;liar&rdquo; &ndash; this because contracts were clear when it came to payments.&ldquo;If you shoot this week, next week Friday you get paid for your call time for the previous week. And we have not been paid,&rdquo; said the actor.Mduduzi Mabaso plays Chauke and Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa will play his wife, Grace.When questioned about the payment issue, Mbali said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and that&rsquo;s not my problem. Sorry, I don&rsquo;t have any information for you.&rdquo;State Enemy Number 1 is expected to hit the cinemas in November. And Elvis said he would confirm the date later.Mduduzi could not be reached for comment and he also failed to respond to our SMSes at the time of going to print.
