WHEN Josephina Mabuza&rsquo;s friend predicted that her husband would suffer from shortness of breath and die, she did not take her seriously. Five months later, Jabulani Mabuza (60) complained that he was struggling to breathe &ndash; and then he collapsed and died! However, more pain was in store for the 50-year-old from Nhlalakahle, near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga. Her friend warned Josephina her son, Sizwe (23) would suffer the same fate as his father. When he started suffering from shortness of breath, he got so scared that he hanged himself! Josephina told Daily Sun she believes there were evil forces at work and her husband and son may have been turned into zombies. &ldquo;My friend predicted my husband&rsquo;s death two years ago and my son&rsquo;s death last year. &ldquo;She always told me she could perform magic and now she is avoiding me. I am very suspicious.&rdquo; Josephina said her son fought death, but it was determined to take him. He would experience difficulty in breathing and his heart would beat very fast. &ldquo;In July he told me he was going to have a nap, and then he hanged himself. &ldquo;I am hurt by the fact that my friend no longer wants to speak to me. All I want are answers,&rdquo; she said. The friend told the SunTeam that rumours being spread about her are rubbish. She said people were confusing her gift of prophecy with evil deeds. Sangoma Aaron Mahlalela (68) advised Josephina to consult a powerful traditional healer. &ldquo;She will not know the truth until she sees a sangoma. Some evil people use muthi to turn their victims into zombies,&rdquo; he claimed.
