A 59-YEAR-OLD mother regrets reporting her son to the cops but she said she had no choice.&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore,&rdquo; she told Daily Sun. &ldquo;I fear this boy will kill me one day. It breaks my heart seeing my child turn into a monster.&rdquo;The mother from Braamfischer, Soweto said her 24-year-old son was making her life a living hell.&ldquo;On Sunday he beat me up, pepper sprayed me and broke the house windows.&rdquo; The mum accused her son of stripping her house of everything she owned, including her TV, her sound system, furniture, plates, clothes and pots.&ldquo;He even stole his own child&rsquo;s clothes and stroller.&rdquo;She said her son used to be a quiet boy who loved sport and spent his time playing cricket but she had spoilt him by giving him everything he wanted.&ldquo;He started changing after his father died and he started hanging around with the wrong crowd. Now everything is going downhill and the family is feeling the pain.&ldquo;What makes things worse is that he has a child who is very young and I have to take care of him. I buy the baby&rsquo;s food and clothes and everything he needs,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old. What will happen to him when I&rsquo;m not here anymore?&rdquo;She said she loved her son very much and didn&rsquo;t want him to go to prison.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said a case of assault and malicious damage to property was opened against the suspect.
