NEW ORLANDO Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret is in for a culture shock when he leads his new charges for the first time against an improved Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash at Orlando Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm).Jonevret, who was cleared to work by SA&rsquo;s Home Affairs this week, can expect a tough baptism of fire.But while the Swedish-born coach is not well known outside his home country, he has the support of SuperSport United mentor Stuart Baxter, who knows him well. Baxter has worked extensively in Sweden and while not close friends, he knows what Jonevret can bring to Pirates.Bucs have been on the rocks since coach Muhsin Ertugral quit last November following a 6-1 hammering by Baxter&rsquo;s SuperSport.Then came a 6-0 thrashing by champions Mamelodi Sundowns that exploded in a full-scale pitch invasion at Loftus Versfeld two weeks ago, forcing Bucs chairman Irvin Khoza to act and replace interim coach Augusto Palacios who had taken over from Ertugral. Baxter said: &ldquo;I know Jonevret from coaching in Sweden. I have played against him and been on coaching courses with him in Sweden. What I know about him is that he is well organised and very serious about football. &ldquo;Pirates have a serious football man. He is a typical Scandinavian coach who takes his job seriously. He is an instructor, will get Pirates well structured and is not a fly-by-night. &ldquo;He is here to earn his money. And that is good news for his chairman.&rdquo;On whether Jonevret can lift Bucs out of the slump that has seen them winless in their last nine league games, Baxter said: &ldquo;He has got to learn about his squad and how best to deliver information to his players. It&rsquo;s a technique. He is not dealing with Swedish or Japanese players and he has to learn.&rdquo;On whether he would succeed, Baxter said: &ldquo;You never know &ndash; maybe we will see a different looking Pirates team.&rdquo;
