SHE has no problem with her beard.Nomsa Gumede (54), a sangoma from Majazana, south of Joburg believes she receives power from her intshebe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m using the sprit of my late great-grandfather. He was a great sangoma in KwaNhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, where I come from,&rdquo; she told Daily Sun. &ldquo;If I shave my beard, I become weak and I can&rsquo;t read the bones.&rdquo; Her beard started growing 23 years ago after she finished her twasa training, and she has only shaved once since then. &ldquo;I lost all my power, but the hair grew back and I was fine.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never shave again. People call me the strong mkhulu.&rdquo; She was a herd girl and never went to school. &ldquo;I began earning money as a domestic worker at the age of 15 but when I was 30 my body started swelling up and I struggled to walk. Doctors could not tell me what was wrong,&rdquo; said Nomsa. Her parents consulted three sangomas, who all said she had a calling.&ldquo;My ancestors showed me the third sangoma through a dream. Within a week of twasa I was better and could walk by myself.&ldquo;My gobela made cuts in my skin at various place on my body, which raised the ancestors.&rdquo; She said her main source of food is igobongo, which is the foam from muthi. Nomsa, who is also a singer and dancer, said it is not true that women with beard like fighting.
