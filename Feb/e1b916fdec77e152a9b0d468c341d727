PREGNANCY Awareness Week kicked off on Monday.The aim is to promote a healthy pregnancy and safe motherhood.Janelle du Plessis, unit manager at Genesis Maternity Clinic, said it is important to educate pregnant women and the public on healthy pregnancies.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to choose a care provider with whom you are comfortable. The care provider will assist you to make the best decisions possible for your birth and your baby. This will empower you with information so that you can make informed decisions.&rdquo; .Mpume Mthalane, from E section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, is eight months pregnant. She said pregnancy is the most precious experience of her life. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m enjoying every moment with my bump.&ldquo;The feeling is indescribable. I feel a connection as I get to bond with my baby.&rdquo;She told Daily Sun in the first trimester of her pregnancy, she had extreme morning sickness.&ldquo;I had bouts of nausea and vomiting, and felt bad tempered. However, it all cleared up at the end of the first three months.&rdquo;Mpume thanked her family and the father of her unborn child for the great support and comfort they have given her.&ldquo;They make sure that I maintain a healthy diet and I get enough rest. Nurses at the clinic always emphasise that complications can be avoided or minimized by taking good care of yourself,&rdquo; said Mpume, who works as a hairdresser at a saloon.&ldquo;I take things easy at work. I get at least three hours of rest because it&rsquo;s not that busy on weekdays. &ldquo;Most of our clients are at work, so we get a very few clients on weekdays. This allows me to sit down and elevate my feet.&rdquo;Mpume said she can&rsquo;t wait to hold her baby.
