Students and management have reached an agreement, ending the week long strike that disrupted the start of the 2017 academic year.Hundreds of new and returning students are expected to finish registering on the Nelson Mandela Drive campus in Mthatha today.This follows a meeting on Monday between SRC and management. The meeting was aimed at finding a solution relating to the heated fees issue.Last week, students went on the rampage, torching a building as well as damaging a security booth and blocking traffic on the N2.When the SunTeam visited the campus yesterday, workers were repairing the damage at the Pink House recreation centre that was burnt down by students.Heavily armed private security guards were patrolling the campus. SRC member Mxolisi Zoko said they agreed on a several issues, such as increasing student accommodation and the registration of returning students who still owed the university. &ldquo;We agreed to begin registration, but we&rsquo;ll make sure that it starts with those students who have debts. &ldquo;They must be prioritised,&rdquo; said Mxolisi.Yonela Thukwayo, spokeswoman for the university, said they were still awaiting an estimate of the damage caused, as assessors would only arrive on campus this week.She confirmed that the SRC had signed an agreement allowing registration to continue.
