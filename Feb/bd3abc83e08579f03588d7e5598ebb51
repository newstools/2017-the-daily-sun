THE high rate of athletes, who have been disqualified from major road running competitions, is giving central Gauteng Athletics (CGA) president James Moloi sleepless nights.Moloi, who is also Athletics South Africa&rsquo;s (ASA) road running chairperson, has urged runners to follow rules.&nbsp;More than 40 runners were disqualified for not wearing their licence numbers at the recent Pick n Pay marathon.&nbsp;High-profile runner, Lucky Mohale, was among those who got disqualified at the Dischem half-marathon last month.Olympic and African 5&thinsp;000m silver medallist, Elroy Gelant, was also disqualified from the Soweto marathon in 2014 for not wearing a proper race number.&nbsp;According to the rules, athletes should wear two provincial race numbers at the back and front, and the competition&rsquo;s race number, making it three in total.&nbsp; This year, ASA is taking the hard line against athletes who fail to adhere to the rules.&nbsp;Moloi appealed to both professional and amateur runners to comply.&nbsp;He also warned athletes who shared the same numbers during race days to stop the habit. &ldquo;If they get hit by a car or die, insurance won&rsquo;t be able to pay,&rdquo; Moloi warned.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you are found guilty of breaking this rule, you will be banned for two years.&rdquo;&nbsp;CGA has about 80% of athletes taking part in competitions across the country. It also holds competitions that attract big-name stars regularly.&nbsp; &nbsp;
