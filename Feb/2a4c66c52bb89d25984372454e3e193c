SUPERSPORT United came out smoking after halftime and netted four goals to gun down Maritzburg United 4-1 to move into third spot in the Absa Premiership at a freezing Lucas Moripe Stadium last night.After trailing to a thunderous Kurt Lentjies goal at the break, Matsatsantsa head coach Stuart Baxter breathed fire into his players at halftime and they turned in a star studded second half to completely outplay their visitors.Mandla Masango started the rout when he stunned Maritzburg with a two goal blitz inside a minute. It was his first goals for the club since joining on loan from Danish side Randers in January. Masango was set up in the 52nd and 53rd minutes by the his former Kaizer Chiefs teammate the evergreen Reneilwe &ldquo;Yeye&rdquo; Letsholonyane. The Team of Choice were on the knees when another former Amakhosi exile brought to United by head coach Stuart Baxter, Kingston Nkhatha made it 3-1 with a stunning goal in the 59th minute. Then came the final nail in Maritzburg&rsquo;s coffin when the dangerous Jeremy Brockie slotted home a defence slitting cross from Thabo Mnyamane on 64 minutes and it was game well and truly over.But all credit to Baxter who opted for an offensive starting line-up with three recognised striker in Brockie, Mnyamane and Nkhatha. Baxter&rsquo;s adventurous tactics are paying big dividends with the Tshwane club having scored the most goals &ndash; 30 after 17 fixtures.But it was the visitors that drew first blood when skipper Lentjies rattled home a pile driver from the edge of the area giving keeper Reyaad Pieterse no chance on 15 minutes. Pieterse and defender Morgan Gould made up five ex-Chiefs players in Baxter&rsquo;s starting line-up.After the setback Matsatsantsa laid siege to the Maritzburg goal and were unlucky to change over 1-0 down. But it was a different story after halftime.
