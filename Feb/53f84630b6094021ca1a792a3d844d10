WHEN the king got up to preach, people fell on the floor in worship.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know our king was so gifted when it comes to religious matters,&rdquo; said a member of God Never Fails Church in Alexandra, Joburg. &ldquo;He preached like a real pastor and we could feel the Holy Spirit coming down,&rdquo; said another.Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini was hosted by the man known as the father of Alex, Linda Twala, and members of his church.Twala, who has a reputation for helping the township&rsquo;s people, met the king in Sandton and took him to places in the township to show him how people lived.When the king went to the church, excited church members were waiting to meet him. People thought he would speak about government or the law, but he spoke about faith.&ldquo;South Africa is faced with so many things but without prayer it won&rsquo;t go anywhere,&rdquo; he said.The people listened, either sitting quietly or shouting with joy and clapping their hands. Before the king sat down, he presented Twala with ihawu and said it was a sign of being a true warrior. Twala said he didn&rsquo;t expect such a wonderful present.Bishop Nhlanhla Nhlapo of the church then took the podium and prayed.People had already felt the Holy Spirit among them and could be seen crying, screaming, rolling on the floor and even speaking in tongues.&ldquo;We are truly honoured to have the king among us,&rdquo; said the bishop. &ldquo;We are a blessed country to have kings who know the word of God.&rdquo;
