Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says he expects Orlando Pirates to give his side a challenging time in Saturday's league clash in Pretoria.The Brazilians started 2017 on a positive note when they defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0, while Bucs fired blanks in a 0-0 draw with Platinum Stars.As such, Mosimane believes that the Sea Robbers will be highly motivated as they visit Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Tshwane.He told the&nbsp;Sowetan: "We got the result (against Celtic) and we know it's going to be difficult against Pirates. But we have the experience. If it's 1-0, then we will take the 1-0."You know when they play Sundowns at Loftus, they always give us a tough time. We will use these two games against Celtic and Pirates to prepare for the Super Cup against TP Mazembe."
