SUPERSPORT United head coach Stuart Baxter is wary of an improved Maritzburg United and their new head coach, Roger de Sa, ahead of the teams&rsquo; clash in an Absa Premiership showdown at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Said Baxter: &ldquo;I have been watching Maritzburg and I&rsquo;m impressed. Also, Roger will want to make his mark, so this is not going to be an easy night for us.&rdquo;Baxter needs three points for Matsatsantsa to keep up with the pacesetters. SuperSport are fourth on 29 points, four behind leaders Kaizer Chiefs with two matches in hand.Said Baxter: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the middle of a busy period and the middle of the season. It&rsquo;s far too early to be looking at the log standings. All I want to do at this stage is keep up with the leading pack.&rdquo;Baxter said he watched the Team of Choice lose 2-1 at home to Amakhosi: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched them a few times and they are a decent side. Maritzburg, like most clubs in the league, have upped their game this season. But like us, they can be good one day and bad the next.&rdquo;Baxter is happy with his charges, especially defender Tefu &ldquo;Masha&rdquo; Mashamaite, who had a run in their Caf Confederation Cup preliminary round 2-1 win over Elgeco Plus of Madagascar at the weekend.Said Baxter: &ldquo;Masha is almost ready to play in the PSL.&rdquo;However, the coach said the bad news was the dislocated shoulder of defender Denwin Farmer, who will be out for six weeks or more. Striker Bradley Grobler is also still recovering from a serious groin injury.
