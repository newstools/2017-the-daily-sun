LITTLE birdies are chirping about how one of Cupid&rsquo;s arrows has allegedly struck man-of-the-moment Afro-pop crooner Musa Sukwene&rsquo;s backside.And as the rumour mill would have it, Rorisang Thandekiso, the presenter of SABC1 pop culture TV show Mzansi Insider, is the lucky lady in question.And if these birdies&rsquo; tweets are anything to go by, then the Mthande hitmaker could even possibly attribute his recent &ldquo;love vibes&rdquo; music chart-busting success to Rorisang.Eager to learn details of these developments, the SunTeam sought comment from &ldquo;Mr Romance&rdquo;, as Musa is affectionately known, only to hear him deny the allegations.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a friend,&rdquo; Musa said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying knowing her or anything, but she&rsquo;s a very good friend of mine.&rdquo;But close sources told of a romantic escapade, featuring the alleged lovebirds. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy about Rorisang. They are happy together. He even posted a picture of them together somewhere in Jozi, where they had gone out for lunch,&rdquo; the first source claimed.&ldquo;In that post, he declared his love for Rorisang and stated that she was his future wife and queen. But I don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;re coming out.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cute that they have found each other. They look good together.&ldquo;Rorisang deserves a good man like Mr Romance.&rdquo; The SunTeam tried to contact Rorisang for comment, but she failed to respond to our SMSes.
