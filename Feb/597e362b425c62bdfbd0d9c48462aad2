THE situation has returned to normal at Naleni High School in V section, Umlazi, south of Durban.Teaching began yesterday as the teachers went back to their classrooms. They told Daily Sun they had formally reported their concerns to the KZN Department of Education, which has promised to deal with the issues.&ldquo;We trust the department will sort the issues out. Nothing has been fixed yet but we hope that will happen soon,&rdquo; said a teacher. Teachers abandoned classes last Friday claiming that the school principal was ignoring the school. They claimed the school is filthy and said that broken doors and windows have not been fixed despite pupils paying R400 each for school fees.Themba Dubazane (47), a parent at the school, said: &ldquo;They made a smart decision, which is what we wanted. Their job is to teach and not involve us and our kids in their issues.&rdquo; Kwazi Mthethwa, the KZN Department of Education spokesman, said that they were dealing with the matter. And Muzi Mahlambi, another KZN department spokesman, said teachers who abandoned classes will not be paid. &ldquo;The department&rsquo;s policy is clear &ndash; no work, no pay.&rdquo;
