&ldquo;MY UNCLE&rsquo;S ghost wouldn&rsquo;t let me rest. I wondered where he disappeared to but all along he had been giving me leads in my dreams.&rdquo; These were the words of a devastated Victor Kabelo (41) from Braamfischer, Soweto. Kabelo told Daily Sun that the last time he heard from his uncle, Eric Kabelo (58), was last June. &ldquo;He lived with my mother in the Vaal but travelled a lot for work. He left for work one morning and never came back,&rdquo; said Victor.He said for the first few days they thought his uncle couldn&rsquo;t be reached on his phone because of bad network coverage. But weeks and even months went by without anyone hearing from him.&ldquo;My mother started panicking but there wasn&rsquo;t much we could do. Then in September I started having nightmares. My uncle kept appearing in my dreams, pointing at a house with his company name on it. This made no sense to me and I ignored it,&rdquo; said Victor.It was only last Monday that Victor&rsquo;s mother suggested they go to the company his uncle worked for in Vereeniging.&ldquo;When we got there, they told us my uncle had gone to Wynberg and fell sick there. He died in September. We got the shock of our lives and understood what my uncle had been trying to tell me in my dreams. &ldquo;The company didn&rsquo;t even bother to contact us, yet they had all our documents and kept my uncle in a government mortuary all this time.&rdquo; Victor said the company apologised and promised to assist with the funeral but they have only paid to transport the corpse from Wynberg to Mahikeng, where Eric will be buried. &ldquo;We are struggling to organise the funeral because we don&rsquo;t have money. We plead with anyone who might be willing to help because we are desperate.&rdquo;
