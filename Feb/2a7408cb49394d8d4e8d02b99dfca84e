IT WAS like manna from heaven for residents of Alexandra&rsquo;s extension seven, who looted the load that a truck lost on the N3 highway.Traffic came to a standstill yesterday morning when a truck lost its load. Hundreds of boxes and sachets of Benny&rsquo;s chicken stock were strewn across Joburg&rsquo;s N3 north, near the Marlboro Road exit&sbquo; north of Joburg.According to JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, three lanes were closed and only one remained open.Nearly 400 people rushed to the scene, scattering across the highway to take the free goods. One resident said she looted because the stuff was damaged and would not be taken back.&ldquo;I will use the chicken stock when I cook for my family. Things are expensive at the shops and it is a blessing when such things happen. No one died and no one was injured.&rdquo; The truck was heading for the DRC from Durban when the driver lost control.Police had their hands full controlling the traffic while trying to keep people from looting. Captain Ali Kodisang said: &ldquo;Police will be investigating claims of looting.&rdquo;
