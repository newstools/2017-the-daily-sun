IT WAS A HISTORIC day in the City of Ekurhuleni as a vision became a reality. On Wednesday the much anticipated phase 1 implementation of the BRT #Harambee included the testing of buses and routes between Kempton Park and Tembisa. Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina, together with MMC of Transport Petrus Mabunda, were joined by major stakeholders in the city such as the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) and the National Taxi Association. Masina stated that many lessons can be drawn from other cities about the implementation of the system. He said that testing the BRT system will start with eight buses. A total of R800 million has been invested in the infrastructure of the project. Peter Mashego of Santaco said that the association welcomes the initiative.&ldquo;We are not here to compete with the BRT system. We want to complement it and ensure full cooperation for the benefit of the people of Ekurhuleni.&rdquo; Masina said that such relations are a vote of confidence in the Harambee BRT system. He said through strategic partnerships the initiative will be a success. The next phase of the system will start with the operation of 40 buses in the area of Tembisa and Kempton Park.
