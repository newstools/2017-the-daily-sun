LAST week, two Mthatha women caused a stir when they fought in public for a teenage lover. Nozintombi Mthombo (38) and NomaJapan Ngqunge (41) fought over the red panties they both received from their teenage lover, Anako Faleni (18) as Valentine&rsquo;s Day presents. The incident has brought so much shame to Nkontyweni Village that the village gogos called an imbizo and condemned the sugar mamas. &ldquo;This fight was a disgrace and an insult to motherhood and womanhood,&rdquo; said one.Wearing traditional outfits, they promised to restore dignity to women before they die.Gogo Kim Mshwebi (86) said the maternal instincts of today&rsquo;s women are gone.&ldquo;Kuphele inimba (the maternal instinct is gone), because naturally you are supposed to develop maternal love when you see a young boy. &ldquo;Instead, many old women are getting horny,&rdquo; she said.Nobulungisa Matyeni (81) said: &ldquo;I will die heartbroken if these issues are not addressed in our village. Maybe an ancestral ceremony needs to be performed for these old women.&ldquo;Back then it was never done. A woman could bath in front of her sons but today that is impossible,&rdquo; said the gogo.Villager madala Sgidimi Mhlawuli (84) said it was wrong to judge the sugar mamas.&ldquo;Men date and marry young girls and are called sugar daddies. There is nothing wrong with Anako dating older women.&ldquo;They must just avoid fighting in public,&rdquo; said the madala. Community leader Joseph Mkhondo said they can&rsquo;t chase the women and Anako away as they have rights.&ldquo;We must make sure they keep their private lives private,&rdquo; he said, adding they had hoped Anako would be present.Anako said he didn&rsquo;t attend the imbizo as he was watching TV.
