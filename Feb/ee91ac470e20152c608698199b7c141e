Stuart Baxter and Roger De Sa lock horns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday night when SuperSport United host Maritzburg United.Matsatsantsa go into the match in fourth spot on the standings, four points off the summit but with a couple of games in hand.This is due to their participation in the CAF Confederation Cup over the last two weekends, where they managed to beat Madagascar side Elgeco Plus on aggregate to book their spot in the first round.Their two league matches this year brought a 5-2 win over Golden Arrows and a 0-0 draw with Free State Stars.Baxter slammed his team's performance against Ea Lla Koto and will be expecting much better against the Team of Choice on their return to league action."I didn't expect the poor quality that we dished up," he said of the Stars outing in Orkney."When you're playing as poorly as we were I think everyone was grasping at straws and I don't have an explanation just now, but we better make sure that we find a solution to it."You take a point when you're not playing very well and you certainly take point when you could have been 4-0 down at half-time."Maritzburg, who enjoyed a 10-game break since their last action, are in ninth position after claiming only a point from their two matches in 2017.The KZN side have not beaten SuperSport in four games, following a 4-1 win in Pretoria in October 2014.Overall, SuperSport have dominated the head-to-head statistics, with 12 wins and seven draws and only two defeats to the Team of Choice in 21 league and cup encounters.Maritzburg defender Brian Onyano will miss the match through suspension, but both Kurt Lentjies and Bevan Fransman are back from their respective bans.Ronwen Williams is still making his way back from injury but could be available for selection. Bradley Grobler is sidelined for at least two months after recently undergoing an unspecified surgery, but otherwise Matsatsantsa should have a fully-fit squad.
