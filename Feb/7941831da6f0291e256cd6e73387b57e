HEARTACHE and agony continue for Egypt head coach Hector Cuper, who has now lost his sixth cup final after the Pharaohs went down 2-1 to a resurgent Cameroon side at Stade de l&rsquo;Amitie in Gabon on Sunday.The Argentinean tactician, who masterminded a convincing performance at the Africa Cup of Nations on the Pharaohs&rsquo; return for the first time since 2010, was left in utter despair.&ldquo;I am very sad that we lost the Afcon final to Cameroon. I really wanted the Egyptian people to be happy today and the players too. The players fought till the end of the game,&rdquo; said the disappointed Cuper on Sunday.&ldquo;I really do not want to say that I am used to losing the final, because I would have loved to win the trophy.&rdquo;Cuper was in charge of Real Mallorca when he inspired them to the Copa del Rey final, but they lost 5-4 on penalties to Barcelona following a 1-1 draw after extra time. The following season, Mallorca reached the Uefa Cup Winners&rsquo; Cup final, where they lost 2-1 to Lazio at Villa Park in Birmingham.In 2000 and 2001, he led the unlikely Valencia to two Uefa Champions League finals, but the Oranges lost to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively on penalty shootouts.Luck continued to escape Cuper in 2010 when he lost the Greek Cup final to Panathinaikos while in charge of Aris Thessaloniki.However, while on all occasions he was in charge of lesser experienced sides, at Afcon 2017 he inspired a rejuvenated Egypt side to the final, but had to bow down to a more physical Cameroon team. &ndash; SUPERSPORT.COM
