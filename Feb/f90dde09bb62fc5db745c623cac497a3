Some Soccer fans think their anger justifies them invading the pitch and trashing the stadium.But officials don't agree.Hooligans who ran riot will be identified, charged and prosecuted.&ldquo;We cannot condone such behaviour and both SAPS and PSL have our full support in identifying and bringing the culprits to justice,&rdquo; said Mamelodi Sundowns media officer Thulani Thuswa.The PSL said in a statement they strongly condemn acts of hooliganism by some of the fans at the Sundowns vs Pirates Absa Premiership fixture at Loftus on Saturday.In the statement the League apologises to supporters and interested parties, both those who were at the stadium and those watching on television.&ldquo;Such behaviour at our stadiums is bad advert for our football,&rdquo; said the statement.The Premier Soccer League is awaiting reports from various stakeholders on what transpired,&rdquo; said Media spokesman Luxolo September. Bucs spokeswoman, Thandi Merafi has not yet commented but said they would be a press conference today(mon) to discuss Saturday&rsquo;s events.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said three cases have been opened against supporters.&ldquo;A case of public violence, malicious damage and assault have been opened. No suspects have been arrested so far but investigations are underway,&rdquo; he said.By the time Bucs had crumbled to a 6-0 humiliation, their supporters could not take it any longer.Five minutes before the end of the match, angry fans turned the Loftus stadium into a war zone.It&rsquo;s believed that the Bucs fans wanted to attack their own players. Fans even turned on each other.Several people got injured, boards were stripped, equipment belonging to media houses got damaged.Cops were called to the scene and a cop armoured vehicle had to intervene to keep the peace by firing stun grenades to disperse the soccer hooligans.Speaking to Daily Sun one of the angry fans said he was sick and tired of going to watch his team losing.&ldquo;We buy tickets to support our team only for them to lose,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful to be called losers by other clubs when I leave the stadium.&rdquo;Another Orlando Pirates fan ranted against his team.&ldquo;These guys are useless. I am no longer supporting them. I will even burn my T-shirt,&rdquo; he said.Many fans said they became violent because they were angry at the loss.&ldquo;When anger takes control, one just lets it out,&rdquo; said a fan.The match was resumed at the 82 minute mark.
