IF TOTTENHAM Hotspur are to keep up the chase on Premier League leaders Chelsea they must find a cure for their Anfield jinx and pile on the misery for fading Liverpool tomorrow.Victory in the late kick-off would see Spurs cut Chelsea s lead to six points before the Blues travel on Sunday to face a Burnley side who are proving formidable at home this season.Spurs have lost five and drawn three of their last eight league matches with Liverpool.The last time they returned from Anfield with three points was in 2011 and before that it was way back in 1993.With Liverpool s title ambitions effectively over after they picked up only three points from the last 15 available, it could be the perfect time for Spurs to improve that record.However, it could be just the kind of fixture Liverpool need to remedy the problem that has turned up the heat on manager Juergen Klopp for the first time since he took over in 2015.While the perception, until recently, was that the Reds have moved forward under the German coach, his record after 54 league games is identical to that of his predecessor Brendan Rodgers won 26, drawn 16, lost 12. In a few days we have an opportunity to play football and we can show then that we are ready for all the other games, because it s Tottenham, who are a top team, former Borussia Dortmund coach Klopp said after a 2-0 defeat by Hull City last weekend that left them fifth, 13 points behind Chelsea.Spurs have the best defensive record in the league with only 16 goals conceded, but will be without two key components of their backline tomorrow, with central defender Jan Vertonghen (ankle) and left-back Danny Rose (knee) still injured.Chelsea will be wary of the trip to Burnley, who have gathered 28 of their 29 points this season at Turf Moor. We believe we can beat Chelsea. Our home form has been unbelievable, Burnley s former Manchester United defender Michael Keane said. They are in for a tough game. Liverpool are not the only side whose title challenge has collapsed. Arsenal s consecutive defeats to Watford and Chelsea have left them down in fourth and the fans grumbling.Manager Arsene Wenger, the focus for much of the concern, will again be in the stands when his side host Hull in tomorrow s early game as he completes a four-match touchline ban.
