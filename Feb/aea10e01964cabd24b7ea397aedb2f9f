THE big guns avoided each other in the Nedbank Cup last 32 draw in Sandton last night. Last year Soweto giants Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs were drawn against each other in the first round, but there won&rsquo;t be a Soweto derby in the opening stages this time. Pirates were drawn against unknown third tier outfit EC Bees, while Chiefs will travel to the Western Cape for a date with amateurs Stellenbosch. Holders SuperSport United, who defeated the Buccaneers 3-2 in a five goal thriller at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on the last day of last season, will start the defence of their title with a tricky away trip to National First Division title contenders Royal Eagles. Free State Stars and rookies Highlands Park will be involved in an all Premiership affair. But the highlight of the first round matches is without a doubt the Kwa-Zulu Natal derby between Golden Arrows and Maritzburg United. There is never a dull moment when the two fierce rivals take on each other. African champions Mamelodi Sundowns were also handed a relatively easy draw as they will be at home against Limpopo based minnows Mariveni United from the ABC Motsepe League. Dates and venues will be announced by the PSL in due course but the first round of games will be played in the first week of March.
