SUSPENDED Baroka FC coach, Jacob &ldquo;Cellular&rdquo; Sakala, and his assistants Mark Harrison and Edward Williams will appear in a disciplinary hearing at the club on 6 March.The trio were put on a &ldquo;no-salary suspension&rdquo; by the club at the weekend after they refused to sign a mandate letter that ordered them to collect 12 points in four matches for Baroka.Kgoloko Thobejane has been recalled from the club&rsquo;s development to take over the reins, with Bakgaga heading for a return to the National First Division if they don&rsquo;t collect points soon.Sakala confirmed to SunSport that their suspension is without pay but declined to go into much detail.&ldquo;The suspension came as a big surprise,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I think in the two games in charge we didn&rsquo;t do badly. It was just the beginning. But I cannot say much about this matter. The only frustrating thing is that the suspension goes without salary. Now I will wait for the DC.&rdquo;Harrison, the former Golden Arrows and Chippa United coach, has threatened legal action but admits to being aware of how things work in football. Baroka chief executive Morgan Mammila has distanced himself from the &ldquo;no-pay&rdquo; subject: &ldquo;We respect them and their rights, despite the fact that they are on suspension. I know nothing about the salary issue, what I know is that they will face the DC.&rdquo; Making things worse is the fact that Baroka will face high-flying Bidvest Wits in their Absa Premiership clash at Milpark Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm). Thobejane will be on the bench and might just pull a rabbit out of the hat to bank three points for the Ga-Mphahlele outfit.
