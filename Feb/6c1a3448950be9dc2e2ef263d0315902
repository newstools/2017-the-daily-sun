THE People&rsquo;s Paper asked SunReaders in Cape Town what they would like to hear from President Jacob Zuma during the State of the Nation address tonight. Gogo Mayna Maluka (67) said: &ldquo;We want the president to address the issue of housing. We are living in crumbling houses and when the rainy season arrives, we have big problems. We have been waiting for houses since 1994, but nothing has happened.&rdquo; Fikile Mbambi (43) said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not even sure whether or not I&rsquo;ll watch the address. We are tired of hearing lies every time the president addresses us. Corruption without consequences is killing the country. These issues must be addressed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mphumelelo Majikijela (26) said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to hearing the president speak about unemployment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lindekhaya Nondzaba (42) said: &ldquo;People are losing their jobs through outsourcing. I will listen to the president in the hope that he will talk about his plans to fight labour brokers in the country.&rdquo; Bianca Dzim (19) said: &ldquo;We want the president to address the issue of education.&nbsp;Fees must fall in our lifetime. Zuma must also talk about the police.&nbsp;Young women are being raped and abused and nothing is done because some policemen are corrupt.&rdquo;&nbsp;Tumelo Mofokeng (32) said: &ldquo;For the past two years, young children have been protesting over high university fees.&nbsp; &ldquo;I expect the president to deal with that in his address.&rdquo;
