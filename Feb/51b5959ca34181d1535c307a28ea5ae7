WHEN Sihle Zondi was given an RDP house suitable for his disability in 2008, he was over the moon.But today he is stuck in a transit camp called Jika Joe, where no one is willing to even help him get to the toilet.A distraught Sihle (52) blamed his former councillor for this sad state of affairs.He told Daily Sun he was given the RDP in Cinderella Park outside Pietermaritzburg back in 2008 when its owner could not be located.All things went well until last January, when he had to go to hospital for an operation.Sihle said since he lived alone he asked someone to stay in his RDP while he was in hospital for the whole month.When he was discharged in February and arrived back home, however, he found that someone else had moved in!&ldquo;An unknown woman now lives in my house. &ldquo;She told me the councillor gave her the RDP and that the person I had left in the house had moved out.&rdquo;He said he went to his councillor, Eunice Majola, who told him there was nothing she could do and accused him of renting his RDP to a foreigner. &ldquo;She then said I would have to stay in the transit camp while I wait for another RDP,&rdquo; Sihle said. And that is where poor Sihle has been since February last year.&ldquo;No one is willing to help me. It&rsquo;s hard to go to the toilet in my wheelchair. This place is not suitable for people with disabilities,&rdquo; he said.Majola said she was aware of the matter. &ldquo;I did not steal the RDP. I was informed that Sihle was renting the house out and would not be returning,&rdquo; said Majola.She said she then decided to give the house to another needy family. Msunduzi&rsquo;s mayor, Themba Njilo, said they would help Sihle and asked for his patience while they find him a suitable house.
