&ldquo;IT IS very sad to be born in a kasi and grow up there. And then when you want to apply for an ID, you are treated like a crooked foreigner and a liar. &ldquo;It is even more painful when your siblings get IDs but you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;Modise Dibyane (30) from Maboloka, near Brits in North West said this after applying for his ID 10 years ago and still not receiving it. Modise told Daily Sun that he feels like taking petrol, going to the Brits Home Affairs office and burning himself there.Modise&rsquo;s gogo Sinna Mokhokhe has been trying to help him get an ID.&ldquo;We gave them everything they wanted, but there is still no progress,&rdquo; said Modise.They last went to the office in October. Modise said officials told him that they needed to do a background check, but so far they have not made a single visit to the family, the school or the community to question people who know Modise. Gogo Sinna helped his three siblings obtain IDs because their mother left them in her care when they were very young. He is now worried because he is not getting any younger and has not been able to get a job. He was born in Maboloka and attended primary and secondary school there.&ldquo;I need to have my ID so that I can find work just like everyone else.&rdquo;Home Affairs&rsquo; spokesman Thabo Mokgola promised to look into the matter.
