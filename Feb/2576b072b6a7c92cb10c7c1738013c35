PUPILS from Tselapedi Primary School have no choice but to relieve themselves in the bushes when nature calls.This is despite the danger of bumping into poisonous snakes, lizards and other creatures. The pupils said since the school opened, teachers have killed at least three snakes. They were all found inside the school&rsquo;s incomplete toilets. The toilets and school building were abandoned, left unfinished by a contractor in 2010. The school in Ga-Mathekga Village, near Marken in Limpopo has a main office and classrooms that have no ceiling and no electricity. If it was not for the parents at the school, who came up with a plan to connect a computer lab in the new building to the electricity of the old school buildings, the children would not be able to use the room.But sadly the connection was not professionally done and poses a danger to the pupils as the cable is not underground. Sophie Phago (48), chairwoman of the school governing body, said: &ldquo;We feel that the department has forgotten about us. It&rsquo;s almost seven years now. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t allow our children to use the unsafe toilets.&rdquo;Spokesman for Limpopo&rsquo;s Basic Education Department, Dr Naledzani Rasila, said they will investigate what happened.&ldquo;We will also check with other departments about the infrastructure so that we can get a full report on this matter.&rdquo;
