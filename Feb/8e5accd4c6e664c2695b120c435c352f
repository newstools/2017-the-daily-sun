HIGHLANDS Park coach Gordon Igesund is confident that his team will survive Absa Premiership relegation at the end of the season. Despite having won just two of their 18 matches, Gordon believes his charges are capable of winning enough games to save the Lions of the North from the dreaded axe. &ldquo;If you ask me if we are capable of winning five or six of the 12 ones remaining, my answer is yes,&rdquo; declared Igesund. &ldquo;Five or six wins will surely take us out of the relegation zone and eventually to survival. We will do it.&rdquo; Highlands suffered their second defeat in the new year and eighth of the season on Saturday to in-form Kaizer Chiefs. They remain in 15th place in the table after that 1-0 defeat. They are one point ahead of bottom-of-the-table Baroka FC, who have a game in hand. Should Baroka pull a rabbit out of the hat and beat or even draw with title contenders Bidvest Wits on Wednesday, Highlands will drop to the bottom. Igesund said, however, that there was no need to push the panic button: &ldquo;This is not a crisis. We still have 12 games to play and we will soldier on. The good thing is that we are conceding less often than before.&rdquo;The Lions of the North have the worst defensive record in the top flight, having let in 34 goals in 18 matches, followed by battling Orlando Pirates with 27 in 17 matches and Ajax Cape Town third with 26 in 18 games. But having coached many teams and winning four league titles with four different teams (Manning Rangers, Bucs, Santos and Mamelodi Sundowns), the former Bafana Bafana coach will rely on his experience to save Highlands from relegation. With this background, skilled players at his disposal &ndash; and having been in this situation before with Moroka Swallows &ndash; Igesund knows how to survive. He said: &ldquo;In my short time at Highlands, I have seen a difference. It&rsquo;s just a matter of time until we get it right.&rdquo;
