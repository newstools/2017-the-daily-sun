LANGELIHLE Ncube was among the many hawkers removed from a market in the Joburg CBD last week. The woman (40) from Lawley, south of Joburg, said she had been selling clothes in Noord Street for years.&ldquo;Since I was removed, I don&rsquo;t known what to do,&rdquo; said the mum of six. When the SunTeam visited the area yesterday, the hawkers were just standing around. Hawker committee leader Wonderful Moyo (40) said: &ldquo;We were first removed six months ago for the city to renovate the market.&rdquo;He said they were promised that they could return at the end of last month, but it never happened. &ldquo;We started seeing illegal hawkers occupying the space, and we demanded to be put back. When we realised no one was going to help us, we decided to move back,&rdquo; said Moyo. &ldquo;We were then given notices to leave and asked for a meeting to discuss the matter, but it never happened.&rdquo;Hawkers said although they were not allowed to sell anything, they would come back every day to protest against Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba, who they claim gave the instruction for them to be removed. Tony Taverna-Turisan, director of communications in the City of Joburg, confirmed the hawkers were removed. He said the Joburg Development Agency undertook to refurbish and upgrade the market in the CBD last year. He said during this process, the hawkers were moved to temporary trading sites. &ldquo;But some traders later went back to the refurbished market. &ldquo;This was before the city was able to follow a verification process to ensure that those who were allocated sites at the upgraded market were the same informal traders who were moved to temporary sites while the market was being upgraded.&rdquo;
