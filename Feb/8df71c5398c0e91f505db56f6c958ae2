LESIBA Sithole (31) from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni was trapped in a cold storage room.He survived 30 minutes in the fridge and came out with frostbite. The terrified man said last Thursday morning he was stocktaking in the cold room at the logistics company where he works.&ldquo;Ivan Greenwood, my manager, stood by the door. He smiled at me and then closed it. &ldquo;I just ignored him and thought that he was pulling a prank. Then after 10 minutes I realised that he was gone. I went to open the door but it was locked from the outside. I started to panic! I thought I was going to freeze to death.&rdquo; He said he sent a &ldquo;Please call me&rdquo; message to his manager, who res- ponded that he was in a meeting.He said he sent a second &ldquo;Please call me&rdquo;, and his manager sent a colleague to open the door for him.Lesiba said he reported the incident to his bosses, but according to him, they didn&rsquo;t take it seriously.He opened a case at Boksburg North cop shop and claims he has since been suspended from work.Captain Juanita Coetzer, Boksburg North spokeswoman, said that the case is pending. &ldquo;We are waiting to get a statement from one of the employers in order for us to take the case to court.&rdquo;Greenwood, the manager, said: &ldquo;The door of the cold room does open from the inside.&rdquo;DSV Logistics&rsquo; Jenny Purchase told Daily Sun they&rsquo;re conducting an internal inquiry, and that both parties have been removed on full pay pending the outcome.
