NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality is offering cash prizes to residents who pay their municipal bills on time. The initiative is part of the Democratic Alliance&rsquo;s efforts to win the trust of the community.The entry form for the competition is attached to the back of municipal bills. Residents stand the chance of winning a vehicle and cash prizes of R5 000 and R10 000. The offer also extends to those who owe the municipality but have made an arrangement to settle their debt.Sibongile Dimbaza, mayor Athol Trollip&rsquo;s spokesman, said: &ldquo;The aim of this competition is to reward residents who pay their municipal bills.&ldquo;It is a part of a marketing strategy to encourage residents to pay debts. &ldquo;The money to run this competition came from a service provider.&ldquo;There are two cars up for grabs, as well as some cash prizes.&rdquo;The competition follows Trollip&rsquo;s decision to impose water restrictions in the area.The mayor has warned residents that those who are found wasting water will have to pay a fine. Trollip has also warned consumers to pay their bills on time.&ldquo;Failure to do so will force us to implement the mayor&rsquo;s regulations, which means the municipality might not provide services to those who do not pay.&rdquo;ANC regional spokesman Gift Ngqondi was not impressed by the DA&rsquo;s competition. He said: &ldquo;The Democratic Alliance brought changes that cost residents their rights. &ldquo;Some residents have had their power switched off because they owed as little as R5. &ldquo;Meanwhile, the penalty fee you have to pay to have power restored is R350.&rdquo;
