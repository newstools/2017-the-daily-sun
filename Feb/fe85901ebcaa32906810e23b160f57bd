Ajax Cape Town manager Stanley Menzo is hopeful of hitting the ground running in the second half of their Premiership campaign that gets underway this month.After a few questionable performances during the break, including a 3-0 defeat to National First Division outfit Stellenbosch FC on Tuesday,&nbsp;the Dutch head coach says their recent results should act as a wake-up call.&nbsp;Menzo also urged his troops to find results over playing beautiful football in the coming months, as they look to climb the league table.Ajax start the second half of their season in ninth place with 18 points from 15 games."Sometimes you need a wake up call I think, hopefully today's [Tuesday] result serves as a wake up call," he told the club's website."You can say we had a good preparation, but it has to show in the matches," the 53-year-old added."You can play nice football, it is all about winning in football &ndash; the moment you don&rsquo;t win; the way of playing will always be questioned."
