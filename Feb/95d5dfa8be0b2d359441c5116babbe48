AMBITIOUS Bidvest Wits, who are chasing three more trophies this season, face a massive test this month, with six matches in 19 days.The big carrot for the Clever Boys head coach Gavin Hunt is a possible Caf Champions League first round showdown with Egyptian giants Al Ahly next month.But first Hunt&rsquo;s Students have to beat Reunion champions Saint-Louisienne in the preliminary round this month. If they succeed they will face the eight-time Champions League winners Al Ahly next.The fact that Mamelodi Sundowns succeeded in winning the Champions League last year has given PSL clubs, including Wits, plenty of encouragement and belief that they can emulate the Brazilians.But after a six-week lay-off Hunt is keeping his fingers crossed his side will be firing on all cylinders when the season resumes next week.Wits resume their Premiership season at home to Ajax Cape Town and end their marathon 19-day schedule away to champions Sundowns on 25 February. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not complaining, as I prefer to be playing games,&rdquo; Hunt said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind playing three matches a week but doing that for three successive weeks is going to be a huge test &ndash; and something has got to give. But we&rsquo;ll be giving it a full go on all fronts this season, including the Nedbank Cup.&rdquo;The good news is the return of striker James Keene, while highly rated SA Under-23 midfielder star Phakamani Mahlambi will add some firepower upfront. Both were out for the first half of the season with long-term injuries. Hunt has also signed experienced former Ajax Cape Town midfielder Granwald Scott, who was playing in Slovakia last year.Hunt said he would be looking at keeping players fit and fresh by rotating his squad: &ldquo;Having Keene back with the addition of Scott and Mahlambi will be like having a new team.&rdquo;Hunt, who earlier this season lifted the MTN8 trophy, is eyeing the league, Nedbank Cup and doing well in Africa.Wits are joint top of the Premiership standings on 25 points with SuperSport United and Cape Town City. The Clever Boys&rsquo; forever fixture against Orlando Pirates will now be played at Orlando Stadium on 15 February.
