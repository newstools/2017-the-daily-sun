TV PRESENTER, Ayanda Thabethe, is allegedly set to join Top Billing.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s according to claims by highly-placed sources close to the starlet, who&rsquo;s a BET: A List host.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been working hard to get a big break, and Top Billing looks set to launch her to a bigger audience,&rdquo; claimed one source.Another source said Ayanda had paid her dues and it&rsquo;s about time she moved to a bigger TV show that would grow her budding career further.&ldquo;Her team has been working hard to make this move possible &ndash; straight from being the face of a clothing brand to Top Billing. This year is going to be big for Ayanda,&rdquo; a close friend claimed.When asked for comment, Ayanda&rsquo;s manager Lucille Gumbi said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like that,&rdquo; before slamming down the phone.Ayanda said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for a Top Billing audition tomorrowon Monday (27 February). And I don&rsquo;t know about having joined a team.&rdquo;Ayanda separated from her partner Andile Ncube and regrouped before coming back to make a success of her acting and presenting jobs.She got her big TV break in Rockville last year, and this was her second chance to be part of the cast, as she had previously said she couldn&rsquo;t join the first season because she was employed full-time.Lately, Ayanda&rsquo;s been romantically linked to rapper and TV presenter &ldquo;Dash&rdquo;, real name Mthoko Mkhathini.Ayanda is steadily building her brand, and is tipped by her colleagues to be one of the major breakout stars in the year ahead.&nbsp;BET: A List executive producer, Juvais Dunn, said: &ldquo;No comment on any new presenter changes, because there&rsquo;s no official statement.&rdquo;Top Billing production manager, Erica Greeff, told Sunday Sun: they heard through the grapevine that it has always been Ayanda&rsquo;s childhood dream to present Top Billing as she grew up watching the show. &ldquo;I can confirm we&rsquo;re auditioning tomorrow, Ayanda was invited to audition.&rdquo;
