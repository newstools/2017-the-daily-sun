Neighbours of the family from Esilahla in Richmond, KZN Midlands, later said they had seen a white Toyota Tazz parked near the house for about two hours before the incident. Family member Brenda Mngadi (32) told Daily Sun the murderers allegedly first switched off the power before storming into the rondavel and starting to shoot. Gogo Cecilia Chiliza (69), her son Dumisani Chiliza (43) and her grandchildren Noxolo Dawood (12) and Nkosi Ndlovu (27) died instantly, while three other members escaped with minor injuries. Brenda said it looked as if the gunmen knew that the family would be holding a gathering.In the other incident, three brothers from Matimatolo, north of Durban were ambushed and shot dead on Saturday. They were allegedly returning from a traditional ceremony in the area when they were attacked by unknown suspects who then fled the scene.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed both incidents. No one has been arrested yet. She urged anyone with information to come forward.
