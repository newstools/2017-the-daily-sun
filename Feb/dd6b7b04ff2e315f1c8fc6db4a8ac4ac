LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO leader Dr Joseph Shabalala&rsquo;s health is still a concern.But there&rsquo;s light at the end of the tunnel.This after the process of booking him for admission at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban has been started.Joseph will be admitted to the hospital for check-ups by specialists, once the process is done.So said Black Mambazo&rsquo;s manager, Xolani Majozi.Late last year, KZN MEC for the Department of Health, Sibongiseni Dlomo, announced that the department would organise specialists at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital, to conduct a check-up on Shabalala.He said he would make sure the Mambazo leader got the best treatment, and that thorough check-ups were performed.Majozi said Joseph was ill but his condition was not critical.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not well, but he&rsquo;s still able to do things like playing with grandkids,&rdquo; said Majozi.He said Joseph&rsquo;s spinal cord was operated on some years ago, and things didn&rsquo;t go well after the operation.&ldquo;His back operation seems to cause health scares for him. He&rsquo;s old and every pain is too much for him.&ldquo;But soon specialists will find out exactly what&rsquo;s wrong with his health, and what needs medical attention,&rdquo; said Majozi.He said family members hoped specialists at Inkosi Albert Luthuli would be able to find a cure for Joseph&rsquo;s illness once the test were done.&ldquo;The process has started. That gives us hope that Bab&rsquo;uShabalala will be all right,&rdquo; said Majozi.In September, Joseph celebrated his 76th birthday in his hometown, Ladysmith, north of KZN, where Mambazo also celebrated 56 years in the music industry.On that day, the local school, then Klipriver High, changed its name to Dr Joseph Shabalala High School.Joseph is respected globally for leading the a capella group that made history by being the first Mzansi group to win a Grammy Award.So far, Black Mambazo has managed to scoop four Grammys.
