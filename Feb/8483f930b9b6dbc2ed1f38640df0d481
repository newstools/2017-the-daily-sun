A VIDEO showing two school bullies slapping two younger boys hard on the side of the head has led to swift action from a top Joburg school.The video went viral over the weekend, leading to Gauteng Eduction MEC Panyaza Lesufi visiting King Edward VII School in Hough-ton on Monday to address the principal and district officials.The four boys had a fight after one of them allegedly posted a nude photo of a cousin of one of the perpetrators. In the video the two smaller boys stand nervously next to each other as the other two prepare to beat them. One of the older boys carefully takes off his blazer and rolls up his shirt sleeves. He then slaps one of the younger boys hard on the side of the face.Another boy then does the same to the second victim. The two younger boys stumble but do not fight back.Headmaster David Lovatt last Thursday wrote on the school&rsquo;s website that a concerned citizen sent the video clip to the school.&ldquo;The incident occurred on 26 January, prior to the start of the school day.&ldquo;The boys have been identified and will be dealt with according to our code of conduct. &ldquo;The boys in the video are in grade 10 and 11,&rdquo; he wrote.Lesufi recommended that all four boys be suspended for seven days. He condemned the incident and said schools should take reports of bullying very seriously. &ldquo;Bullying is forbidden and schools should adopt a zero tolerance. We urge pupils to treat each other with respect.&rdquo; He said the department will provide support to the victims and all pupils who might need it, and that the school governing board must set up a team to handle the disciplinary procedure against the alleged bullies.&ldquo;The department will do an independent investigation.&rdquo; Lovatt described the footage as extremely disturbing, adding that it in no way reflects the culture or traditions of the school.&ldquo;The victims will be given counselling and our full support,&rdquo; he said.
