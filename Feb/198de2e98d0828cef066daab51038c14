THEMBA Mvelase, the man responsible for the Ezakheni mass murder, was yesterday sentenced to six life terms and 26 years imprisonment in the Durban High Court. The 37-year-old has been in custody since November 2014. The court found that he showed no remorse for his actions. Judge Nompumelelo Radebe said residents of Ezakheni in Ladysmith, KZN Midlands, where the crimes were committed, were traumatised.Last Wednesday, the Ramsgate High Court convicted him of six counts of murder, five of attempted murder and one of malicious damage to property.His sentencing, which was supposed to take place at the same court the following day, was postponed after Mvelase fainted at the news of the conviction and had to be rushed to hospital.Mvelase was arrested a month after shooting at a Mercedes- Benz travelling down Pieters Road from a wedding. One woman died and four other occupants were injured.A fully loaded taxi that had been following the Mercedes tried to dodge the bullets and collided with a truck in the opposite lane, killing eight commuters.Mvelase also shot five people at a car wash later that day.He was found guilty of killing the Mercedes-Benz occupant, and the five people at the car wash, as well as the attempted murder of five other people injured during the shooting in both incidents. KZN Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda said: &ldquo;We are happy with the ruling. &ldquo;The sentence will hopefully send a clear message to other criminals that our justice system works.&rdquo;
