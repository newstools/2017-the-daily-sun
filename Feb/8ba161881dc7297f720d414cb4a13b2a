AFRICAN and Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns will use tomorrow&rsquo;s mouth-watering league clash with Orlando Pirates to prepare for their Caf Super Cup final against DR Congo&rsquo;s TP Mazembe next weekend.Sundowns, fresh from their 1-0 away win over Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday, host Bucs at Loftus Stadium at 3.30pm tomorrow. Downs, the Caf Champions League winners, host Caf Confederation Cup champions Mazembe at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on 18 February.Said Downs head coach Pitso Mosimane: &ldquo;I am using the Pirates game to get ready for the Super Cup.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;Celtic created chances but our greater experience saw us clinch the three points. I will be happy with the same result against Pirates.&ldquo;Pirates are a difficult side to play. They always give us a tough time at Loftus. This will be ideal preparation for the Super Cup.&rdquo;Mosimane was happy with his new Algerian left-back Fares Hachi, who made his debut against Phunya Sele Sele: &ldquo;Hachi came at the right time with Tebogo Langerman injured and did well.&rdquo;The coach was also happy with goal-scorer Themba Zwane: &ldquo;He scored a great goal, he showed maturity and was our super sub.&rdquo;Bucs caretaker coach Augusto Palacios is contemplating ringing the changes to beef up his attack that fired blanks in their 0-0 draw away to Platinum Stars on Wednesday.Said Palacios: &ldquo;We are struggling to score but defensively we were solid. I might have to change the attack and look for another attacking combination, as we are failing to convert our chances.&rdquo;Bucs have been relying on Tendai Ndoro who has netted 11 goals so far, but Palacios wants others to come to the party. Ndoro was partnered with Thembinkosi Lorch against Dikwena.Said the Peruvian born coach: &ldquo;I have options in attack and maybe it&rsquo;s time to give others a chance.&rdquo;Palacios has Ayanda Nkosi, Bernard Morrison, Thamsanqa Gabuza, Thabiso Kutumela and Mahlatse Makudubela waiting in the wings.The coach is still waiting on a late fitness report on goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo and midfielder Issa Sarr, who were both injured against Dikwena.Said Palacios: &ldquo;I will know in the morning how badly they are injured and whether they will be available or not for Sundowns.&rdquo;He said he expected a battle against Downs: &ldquo;They are a top team but we need to go to Loftus with a winning mentality and get three points. We can&rsquo;t afford to keep dropping points, as the league is so tight this season.&rdquo;
