THE mayor&rsquo;s spade moved only a little bit of dirt, but his action signified a massive housing boost on the way for Ekurhuleni residents.Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina yesterday announced that no less than 22 000 housing units would soon be built as part of the Leeuwpoort mega-housing project and that more were on the way.Masina said the municipality is determined to reduce the housing backlog in Ekurhuleni and would be building 100 000 houses in the metro in the next financial year to benefit residents in its 119 informal settlements.Masina spoke at the sod-turning event at Leeuwpoort, which is said to be one of the biggest human settlements projects in the Gauteng city region. It boasts R2 billion in investments to be implemented in partnership between the Ekurhuleni metro and the provincial and national human settlements departments.Masina said that this year would see the start of bulk infrastructure services such as water and sewerage systems, with the construction of roads and other structures starting next year.Masina said: &ldquo;The use of local labour and local empowerment through subcontracting from the community where the development is taking place is very important to government.&rdquo; Keith Khoza, Gauteng Human Settlements spokesman, said the Leeuwpoort project would set the programme for bigger projects to come.
