NATIONAL First Division side AmaZulu are eyeing a return to the Absa Premiership. With the second round resuming tomorrow Usuthu skipper Tapelo Nyongo is confident his side will be one of the top two teams at the end of the season. AmaZulu, who are fourth in the NFD table with 23 points from 15 first round fixures, will kick off their second round with a tough clash with another former PSL team, University of Pretoria, away at Tuks Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Usuthu thumped AmaTuks 3-0 at Princess Magogo Stadium in the first round.AmaTuks go into this match in ninth place in the table with 21 points. The two teams are only separated by three points. Nyongo is fully aware that this will be a tricky encounter for them as AmaTuks might be looking for revenge. Said Nyongo: &ldquo;This is one of the key fixtures for us. It&rsquo;s the first game of the second round, it&rsquo;s important to have a positive start. &ldquo;We understand that they are behind us in the standings but that does not mean we must underestimate them. In the second round we will treat everyone as equals. Our main objective is to get promoted at the end of the season.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;As a captain I&rsquo;m happy that all the players are back from injury, which makes competition tight in the team.&rdquo;In other matches, log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu will host Mbombela United at Umhlathuze Sports Complex on Sunday (3.30pm), while struggling Santos will host their equally beleaguered neighbours Cape Town All Stars in a Cape derby at Parow Park at the same time.
