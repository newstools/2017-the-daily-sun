FREE State Stars have not been able to cash in on the sale of striker Moeketsi Sekola.Sekola signed a pre-contract agreement with PSL rookies Highlands Park and will join them as a free agent on a three-year deal when his contract expires in June.SunSport has reliably learnt that Highlands tried to negotiate Sekola&rsquo;s immediate release prior to Tuesday&rsquo;s transfer window deadline, but that Stars&rsquo; management allegedly priced him out of the market because they apparently didn&rsquo;t want to strengthen their fellow-relegation candidates. They felt Sekola&rsquo;s scoring prowess, which saw him crowned top Absa Premiership scorer with 14 goals in the 2014-15 season, could come back to haunt them.Only a point separates the two teams in the Absa Premiership table, where Ea Lla Koto are third from bottom on 14 points from 15 matches, and Highlands below them on 13 points from the same number of games. Said SunSport&rsquo;s source: &ldquo;Stars&rsquo; management said they couldn&rsquo;t allow their player to go a team against whom they are competing to avoid relegation.&ldquo;They felt that allowing Sekola to join them would weaken Stars and strengthen Highlands. That&rsquo;s why they wanted about R500 000 for a loan deal. &ldquo;Highlands offered half the amount, as they were not prepared to break the bank. Their priority at the moment is to add stability in defence, not beefing up attack.&rdquo; The price tag for a loan deal involving the 27-year-old also scared off Bidvest Wits, who were interested in signing him for six months. &ldquo;Wits and Stars couldn&rsquo;t agree on a loan fee as Wits felt it was too much for six months. So the deal also fell through.&rdquo;
