Orlando Pirates defender Happy Jele is convinced it's just a matter of time before Bucs get back into the groove following a spate of poor results.The Buccaneers' dry spell continued when they shared the spoils in a goalless draw with Platinum Stars on Wednesday. The stalemate stretched the Bucs' winless streak in all competitions to six games."We are currently going through a rough patch, but I strongly believe that soon we will be back at our best," he told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."Well, against Platinum Stars we didn't create many scoring chances, but at least we managed to come out with a single point. We have been working hard to rectify our defensive errors and our finishing since resuming our training after mid-term break."Having gone six matches without a win is becoming a concern for a team of Pirates' caliber, but I'm optimistic that it's just a matter of time we return to our winning ways."Next up for Pirates is the highly-anticipated showdown with Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on Saturday.About the encounter, Jele added: "We are looking forward for Sundowns' clash, and there's no doubt it's going to be a tough game with both teams gunning for a much needed victory, but we need a morale-boosting win in a game of this magnitude to redeem ourselves."
