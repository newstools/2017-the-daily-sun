WHILE the protest over an increased municipal fee and an unreleased audit report goes on in Bela-Bela, Limpopo, children are the ones suffering most. Hundreds of pupils from eight schools in the area have not been to school for two days. Yesterday morning they were turned back by their teachers, who feared for their safety. This was after protesters set a municipal office and the mayor&rsquo;s car alight on Tuesday. The residents complain that the municipality charged them an extra R500 electricity fee since October without consulting them.They have vowed to protest every day until the municipality cancels the fee. They also want the council to release an auditor&rsquo;s report into corruption to the public.Resident David Sebola (35) told Daily Sun he has not been able to buy prepaid electricity recently as the municipality demands that he pays the R500 first. &ldquo;My family and I now survive on junk food as we can&rsquo;t cook. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have R500 but I do have the money to buy electricity.&rdquo; Margaret Makhubele, who is an expanded public works programme worker, said she earns only R680 a month. &ldquo;How does the municipality expect me and my kids to survive after paying them? The council owes Eskom and wants to use our money to pay the debt,&rdquo; she said.Mayor Jeremiah Ngobeni said the electricity charge was approved last year before he became mayor.He said the charge had been suspended until further notice and he will address the residents today.He added that the KPMG report was confidential and had been sent to the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation for recommendations and to charge those implicated. &ldquo;The report will be released to the public as soon as it&rsquo;s back with us,&rdquo; said Ngobeni.
