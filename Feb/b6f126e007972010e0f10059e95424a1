NOMASONTO Ndinisa (63) has been left with an empty house after robbers pretending to be from a furniture company cleaned out her home.The devastated gogo from Chiawelo, Soweto, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;These thugs have stripped me of everything I have worked hard for my whole life. &ldquo;I feel like my whole world has come crashing down.&ldquo;All my pension savings are gone. I recently retired and spent my retirement money on brand new furniture for my house.&ldquo;On Monday, men pretending to be from a furniture company came to my house and found my grandchild there. &ldquo;They presented her with documents claiming they had been sent to repossess my belongings as I was behind with payments.&rdquo;The men arrived in a blue truck, said gogo&rsquo;s granddaughter, Obakeng (16).&ldquo;I was approached by three men in blue overalls who claimed they were sent to fetch my gogo&rsquo;s furniture.&ldquo;They produced papers and told me she was behind with some of her payments. They said since she wasn&rsquo;t there, they needed me to sign some documents on her behalf, which I did.&rdquo;The men took all the furniture except the beds. They removed the surround sound music system, plasma TV and microwave oven before driving off. Residents of the area claim this is not the first time something like this has happened.Tshepo Molefe (34) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The community has been reporting this truck for some time but police are not doing much to help. &ldquo;This truck has been making the rounds all over our neighbourhood and we are tired of it. &ldquo;Something must be done . . . these guys must be stopped!&rdquo;Moroka police spokesman Molefe Mokoena said police are currently investigating a case of theft but no arrests have been made.
