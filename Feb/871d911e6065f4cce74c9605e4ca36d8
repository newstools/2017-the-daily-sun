GAUTENG&rsquo;S health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, has resigned following the damning &nbsp;findings of an investigation into the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients last year.Health ombud Malegapuru Makgoba released the findings of his investigation today.The patients died between March and December 2015 following the provincial health department&rsquo;s decision to move the patients from the Life Esidimeni facility in Randfontein last year and place them with 27 NGOs instead.This, Mahlangu claimed at the time, was to save money and roll out the policy of taking patients out of institutions and placing them in community-type care instead.Many voices were raised in protest against this at the time. Parents of the patients protested three times and the department was taken to court to try to stop this happening twice by organisations representing psychiatrists.In September, Mahlangu publicly announced that 36 patients had died. According to Makgoba, 77 patients had already died by then.Details contained in the report of the treatment of the mentally ill patients are shocking. Some NGO representatives "rocked up in&nbsp; open&nbsp; &lsquo;bakkies&rsquo;"&nbsp; to transport the patients to their premises. Some behaved like it was " an&nbsp; &lsquo;auction cattle&nbsp; market&rsquo; " as they chose the patients they would take. In some cases,&nbsp; the causes of death included malnutrition and exposure to the cold. Among Mahlangu&rsquo;s recommendations are:- Disciplinary proceedings be brought against doctors and health officials involved in the decision&nbsp; to move the patients to the NGOs;- Legal proceedings be brought against NGOs that were operating unlawfully at which the mentally ill people died. All 27 of them were operating with invalid licenses; and- Patients still at these unlawful NGOs must be moved to provincial care facilities within 45 days; The findings also stated: &ldquo;The response must include an unconditional apology to families and relatives of deceased and live patients who were subjected to this avoidable trauma; and as a result of the emotional and psychological trauma the relatives have endured&sbquo; psychological counselling and support must be provided immediately.&ldquo;The outcome of such process should determine the way forward such as mechanisms of redress and compensation.&ldquo;A credible prominent South African with an established track record should lead such a process.&rdquo;Public interest law centre Section 27 is demanding &ldquo;political, civil and criminal accountability for those responsible&rdquo;.
