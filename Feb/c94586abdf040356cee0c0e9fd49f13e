Ajax Cape Town goalkeeper Jody February says he is happy about his form for the Ikamva-based side, despite an indifferent season in the Premiership.The Urban Warriors are currently 11th in the league standings after 18 games, after a terrible start to the campaign - which culminated in the exit of manager Roger de Sa.However, February has been one of the shining lights in an otherwise bleak season for the Cape side thus far.Following the exit of first-choice stopper Anssi Jaakkola to English Championship side Reading, the 20-year-old won over De Sa and his successor Stanley Menzo as the club's first choice keeper."While I think I have been doing well recently, the team's results have been a bit up and down," February told&nbsp;IOL. "So that is obviously disappointing.&nbsp;"But for my first season as a regular in the PSL I'm happy so far, and I'm improving with each and every game."I cannot be complacent because there are some very good goalkeepers pushing me, and waiting for their opportunity. It's not just Brandon (Petersen) and Darren (Johnson), there are some really promising young goalkeepers coming up through the ranks."The South Africa youth international has kept five clean sheets in 16 games since making his league debut last season.
