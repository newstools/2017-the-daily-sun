ZIMBABWEAN and Orlando Pirates striker, Tendai Ndoro, is accused of living a fake life.&nbsp;A woman, who claims to be one of the soccer star&rsquo;s girlfriends, says he lives a false life just to lure women.The woman alleges Ndoro hides his kids from his nyatsis and also hides the fact that he&rsquo;s a married man &ndash; only to leave the women heartbroken at the end.A source close to the situation said: &ldquo;Ndoro is married to Zinhle Ngwenya, who has always given him moral support.&ldquo;Everyone Ndoro&rsquo;s family acknowledges Zinhle as his wife. Zinhle was his pillar of strength.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;We were shocked when we saw Ndoro dining with, and posting pictures of his girlfriend, Patience Ndlovu, on his social network pages.&ldquo;Now, he posts pictures of Patience and his other kid, but none of his child with Zinhle. But Patience is just Ndoro&rsquo;s distraction.&rdquo;A third source said: &ldquo;Everyone knows Patience behaves badly.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a trouble maker, and they&rsquo;ve warned him about her, but he doesn&rsquo;t listen.&ldquo;Ndoro will regret the day he left Zinhle and his kid for Patience, who&rsquo;s only after fame and money.&nbsp;&ldquo;His family doesn&rsquo;t approve of his relationship with Patience.&rdquo;Last month, Sunday Sun reported Ndoro was allegedly harassing his ex-girlfriend, Ado Adams, demanding that she returns to him in threatening text messages.&nbsp;When the SunTeam contacted Zinhle, she refused to comment.Orlando Pirates official, Floyd Mbhele, said he cannot respond on players&rsquo; personal matters.He told Sunday Sun Ndoro could not answer his phone because he was in camp and that players are not allowed to use their phones.Patience could not be reached for comment.
