BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt and Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane are playing mind games ahead of their Absa Premiership meeting tomorrow. The highly anticipated game between the Brazilians and the Clever Boys at Loftus Versfeld (6pm) is the pick of the Premiership matches this weekend considering the log position of both clubs.But both coaches have played down the significance of this meeting. Mosimane claims he is not even looking at the log standings at the moment, despite his team&rsquo;s rise in the log, while Hunt insists that the title is in the Brazilians&rsquo; hands. Mosimane, who went to spy on Wits&rsquo; 5-0 demolition of Baroka FC on Wednesday, said they were not under any pressure to lose to Wits. Hunt, on the other hand, said the Brazilians have more quality than his team and were favourites to win the match. The Tshwane giants laboured to a 2-1 victory over Platinum Stars midweek, while the Clever Boys cruised to a 5-0 victory over Baroka FC. The Brazilians collected six points against the Clever Boys in the past season. Sundowns won the league title with a record number of 71 points &ndash; 14 points more than second-placed Wits.This will be their second meeting this season after Wits hammered Sundowns 3-0 to capture the MTN8 title earlier in the season. The Brazilians&rsquo; galaxy of stars, such as Percy Tau, Khama Billiat, Themba Zwane and Anthony Laffor, will trade blows with the Clever Boys&rsquo; on-from stars, including Phakamani Mahlambi, Daine Klate, Gabadinho Mhango and James Keene. Wits are going into the big game where Hunt wants themCONTINUED ON PAGE 31
