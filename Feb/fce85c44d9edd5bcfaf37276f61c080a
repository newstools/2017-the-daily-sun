TEMPERAMENTAL Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt is eyeing a good run in the Caf Champions League. Hunt says the Clever Boys will take this competition seriously this time around after being eliminated in the preliminary rounds in the past. The hard-to-please coach hopes to guide his team to the lucrative group stages of Africa&rsquo;s premier club competition. Hunt and his team aim to juggle their Premiership ambitions and their African ambitions this season. The Clever Boys visit unknown SS Saint-Louisienne of Reunion at Stade Theophile Hoarau on Saturday (7pm). Hunt&rsquo;s charges resumed their Absa Premiership campaign with a commanding 5-0 victory over Ajax Cape Town midweek. The Clever Boys are among the favourites to claim the Premiership title this season. Despite this victory being their biggest of the season, Hunt was not pleased, as he believed his boys could have scored double figures. Hunt said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good result after a six-week break but I wanted us to score more goals to improve our goal difference. We can do better. This was the first game after a long break.&rdquo; If Hunt&rsquo;s men see off the minnows of Reunion as expected, they will play against African powerhouses Al Ahly of Egypt in the next round. Hunt said: &ldquo;I will field a strong team. We won&rsquo;t take this game for granted. It&rsquo;s much easier and better for us to get into the group stages than it was in the past.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we win two games we reach the group stage. I&rsquo;ve played Al Ahly before and know what they are all about. We have to try to get to the next round before thinking about them.&rdquo; Hunt is blessed with an abundance of talent but still insists he doesn&rsquo;t have enough depth in his squad. He said: &ldquo;Can we keep going like this for five weeks? I don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t have a big squad. I just hope we&rsquo;re able to keep going. &ldquo;But these are exciting times for Wits and we are looking forward to the challenge.&rdquo; Hunt is relying on his experienced players to get them over the line in the title race: &ldquo;We have experience on our side, maybe that will help us.&rdquo;
