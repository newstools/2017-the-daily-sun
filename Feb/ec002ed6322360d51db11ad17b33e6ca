ALL over the Nelson Mandela metro, the call has gone out for water to be saved.But residents in KwaNobuhle kasi, Uitenhage said the metro itself was the biggest waster of water!They said a river of clean drinking water has been oozing out of a burst pipe on a street corner for the past two weeks. The water runs down at the corner of Sisilana and Siwasa streets, and soon turns into a muddy mess.The street is one of the busiest in the kasi, with cars and taxis driving past on their way to Gunguluza. Vuyokazi Mahlahla (36) said they have to keep scolding kids not to play in the mud.&ldquo;This leaking water pipe has turned our street into a mess.&ldquo;The water snakes past our houses and is wasted in storm water drains. Even our local public phone is swimming in the water.&rdquo;She claimed that residents had approached ward 47 ANC councillor Nontuthuzelo Skweyiya&rsquo;s office to no avail.Mthubanzi Mniki, the municipal spokesman, said residents should report the problem and get a reference number so that their query can be followed up effectively. &ldquo;The toll-free municipal number is 0800 50 2020.&rdquo;
