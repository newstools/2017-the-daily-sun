Golden Arrows and Bloemfontein Celtic will be looking to bounce back from poor starts to 2017 when they lock horns in a Premiership tussle at the Prince Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu on Saturday.Abafana Bes'thende were trounced 5-2 by leaders SuperSport United in midweek when Siwelele were turning in a credible performance in a 1-0 loss to defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns.It was the first match of the year for both sides as the league resumed after a near two-month break.Despite the result, Arrows boss Clinton Larsen was pleased, but he is hoping to do far better against his former club as they aim to consolidate their top eight position."We may have lost in midweek, but if you ask SuperSport they will tell you the scoreline was flattering," the coach said. "It was a very positive game in many aspects for us and we will hope to build on that on Saturday."Celtic also did well against Sundowns, but this is a home game and we need to win at home."Larsen's Arrows dropped to eighth with their defeat, with Celtic slipping to 13th.Lehlohonolo Nonyane (groin) is the only absentee for the home side, with the visitors not reporting any fresh injuries.
