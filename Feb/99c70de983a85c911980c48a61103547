THUGS have invaded Soul City squatter camp in Kagiso in Mogale City.They break into homes, looking only for cooking pots. Residents say if they find food inside, they spill it on the floor and leave with the empty pots.Close to 11 shacks in Soul City have been hit by the thugs.Community leader Terror Mphoselwa said thugs sell the pots to scrapyards, where they are melted down for aluminium. &ldquo;We hear it pays well and is the reason for the craze,&rdquo; said a resident.Another resident said he went home in December and only came back last week. &ldquo;When I opened my shack, I was shocked to see my pots were gone. I had to eat meat without pap. I&rsquo;m afraid to buy more because they will just break in and steal them.&rdquo;Another man said when he came back from work he found leftover food spilled on the floor and his pots gone.He went to open a case and said cops are looking for the suspects. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what we should use to cook now. I&rsquo;m thinking of using tins to cook in because I can&rsquo;t buy pots that will just be stolen anyway.&rdquo; Captain Solomon Sibiya said several cases were opened in the area and a thug was beaten by residents after they accused him of stealing. Sibiya said six residents were bust for the beating and are out on bail.
