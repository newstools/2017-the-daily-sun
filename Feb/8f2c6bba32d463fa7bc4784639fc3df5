THE residents of a neglected section in the east of Mamelodi, Tshwane were fed up with their lack of services and protested about it early yesterday.But other residents of the big kasi were not impressed with their ward 100 neighbours.The protesters blocked Solomon Mahlangu Drive with burning tyres, logs and rocks, causing a traffic jam that left motorists and taxis struggling for alternative routes.Angry residents from neighbouring areas also complained that there had been no police to control the crowd between 5am and 8am. Ward 100 residents sang struggle songs and stopped anyone who came near the road, forcing them to join the protest. Community leader Aaron Mabitsela said the municipality had neglected them. &ldquo;We were moved from various squatter camps and promised permanent stands and services in 2015, but until today we have no water and electricity and we still use the bucket system instead of toilets. &ldquo;The water we get from the tanks is dirty, while the bucket toilets are never cleaned,&rdquo; he said. Resident Freddie Mosese said: &ldquo;When he was campaigning to be mayor, Solly Msimanga was often in Mamelodi. Now that he has the position, we only see him on TV talking about corruption.&rdquo; Maria Sefaamela (37), a resident of Nellmapius, said she was disappointed that police had not arrived to control the protesters. &ldquo;Our property and people who were going to work were not safe,&rdquo; she said. Captain Michael Mbewe said he would investigate why police arrived late. He said no one was arrested and no case was reported. Mayoral spokesman Samkelo Mgobozi said Msimanga will still visit all the wards in Tshwane.
