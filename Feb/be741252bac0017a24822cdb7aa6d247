AT FIRST the residents were happy when portable bucket toilets were delivered to their squatter camp.But today they want the Ekurhuleni Municipality to take them away.This is after a three-year-old child fell inside a toilet bucket and drowned in kak two weeks ago.Fuming residents of Angelo squatter camp said the toilets were not locked at the back where the buckets are removed, making it dangerous for kids.Community leader Johannes Pelo said: &ldquo;Children are children and they often end up in dangerous situations if they are not being watched.&rdquo;Some of the toilets are connected to drains while others use the bucket system.Community leaders say the toilets connected to drains are safer because the container is secured.&ldquo;The bucket system is not only dangerous to our children but is &shy;also degrading.&ldquo;Municipal workers come during the day to remove the shit in front of everyone and it&rsquo;s not decent as some of the waste gets strewn on the ground and is left like that,&rdquo; said resident Enos Mavula.He added that since the child drowned two weeks ago, they make sure that children&rsquo;s activities are monitored.The family of the child who drowned said they were not ready to speak about the incident.The municipality said it was investigating the matter.
