Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce says he expects a positive performance from his players when his side face Stoke City in Saturday's Premier League clash at the Bet365 Stadium.The Eagles were pummelled 4-0 by Sunderland at home in their last league encounter, and will no doubt hope to react positively against the Potters.Allardyce told reporters: "We are ninth in the league on away results and hopefully that will continue at Stoke."'Shut off the outside world'. I always tell a player to do that, whether it's good, bad or indifferent because that can affect you and at the moment there's a lot of negativity about us."My disappointment is that I haven't been able to give as many good results as I expected when I walked in here, so I've been reflecting on what we can do different."In team news, new signing Luka Milivojevic is available for the away team after receiving his visa. Meanwhile, Xherdan Shaqiri and Glen Johnson are both in doubt for Stoke as they struggle to recover from injury.
