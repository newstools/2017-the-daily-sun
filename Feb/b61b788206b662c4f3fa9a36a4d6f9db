IT RAINED on the N2 south bound near the old Durban Airport in KZN yesterday.But this time passing motorists and pedestrians rejoiced at the rain because a bakkie loaded with alcohol overturned on the highway.The looters helped themselves to beer and whisky at the scene of the crash at Reunion, just before Umlazi, south of Durban.Motorist Zwe Cele (34) said he couldn&rsquo;t believe what he saw.&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t care any more. Instead of driving past the accident or helping the driver and his passengers, people went for the booze. Workers on the back of construction bakkies jumped off and grabbed the beer that was scattered all over the grass next to the road, or whatever was still left on the back of the bakkie.&rdquo; Another motorist said the thirsty looters went for quart bottles and didn&rsquo;t care who was watching them. &ldquo;By the time paramedics got to the scene, the looters were well advanced with their business.&rdquo; Garrith Jamieson, spokesman for Rescue Care paramedics, said: &ldquo;Three people were hurt and the bakkie&rsquo;s load was looted.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;Three people were rushed to hospital after the bakkie overturned. A case of reckless and negligent driving was opened at Montclair Police Station.&rdquo;
