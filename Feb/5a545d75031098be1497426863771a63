THREE Khayelitsha men got the beating of their lives &ndash; allegedly at the hands of church members!&nbsp; Brothers Khululekani (24) and Akhona Ngcana (29) and their friend Zibele Ginisile (26) said they were accused of stealing a Samsung phone on Sunday.&nbsp; Khululekani said he was walking near a church when people grabbed him.&nbsp; &ldquo;They accused me of stealing a phone. They beat me up and dragged me into the church. Once inside they continued to beat me and even brought in my brother Akhona, and Zibele. They too were beaten,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Zibele sells smileys a few streets from the church. He said he was with Akhona at his business when a group of about 10 people dragged them to the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were beaten but no phone was found on us.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Daily Sun visited the family, Akhona was asleep, trying to recover from the beating.&nbsp; The two brothers&rsquo; mother, Lulama Ngcana (58), said she found her children bleeding in the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The church must pay for what they did,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Revolution Church spokesman Welcome Mabhuko said he was aware of the incident but denied it took place in church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young man was beaten by people in the street. When he came to the church he was already bleeding,&rdquo; he said.
