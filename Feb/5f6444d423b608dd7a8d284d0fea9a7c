&ldquo;WE WANT nothing to do with this funeral parlour! Their service sucks!&rdquo; These were the words of members of Amogelang Punkys Society, who joined Dikwena Funeral Parlour&rsquo;s group burial scheme two years ago. According to the women from block BB of Soshanguve, Tshwane the undertaker put the bodies of their loved ones in the wrong coffins twice. The first incident happened in December and again on Friday.The enraged women held the hearse driver hostage, demanding that the mistake be fixed. Amogelang&rsquo;s treasurer, Lizzy Theme (39), said they were surprised when the hearse brought Bishop Micker Nkosi&rsquo;s body in a pine coffin instead of a 3T model. &ldquo;The driver told us her job was to deliver the body and that she was not involved in preparing it,&rdquo; Lizzy said. She said they struggled to get hold of the funeral parlour&rsquo;s manager, whose name was only given as Kelebogile. &ldquo;When we finally found her, she asked us to come to her office,&rdquo; said Lizzy. She said the right coffin was sent to the family after they spoke to Kelebogile, who apologised. She said she couldn&rsquo;t understand how the mistake was made because the forms they handed in when they joined the burial scheme stated which coffins they wanted. Lizzy said they would decide on a new undertaker at their next meeting because they were gatvol of Dikwena. The SunTeam spoke to Kelebogile, who refused to give her surname. She claimed the bishop&rsquo;s documents stated that he wanted to be buried in a pine coffin and his wife agreed to everything.
