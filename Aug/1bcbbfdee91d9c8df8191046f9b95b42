PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s former bodyguard has been appointed acting head of the police intelligence unit. Major-General King Ngcobo, who was a senior member of the presidential protection unit, was appointed to the post despite the fact that he was previously accused of submitting a fake matric certificate to the SAPS. The news comes just a few days after acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba announced he would take over the division. Mothiba made the announcement after sacking Major-General Pat Mokushane from his post as crime intelligence head on Monday. It was reported that Mokushane was dismissed because he didn&rsquo;t have security clearance, and was being investigated for running his business from work. There were also allegations that he had a criminal record, and had taken money from the unit&rsquo;s slush fund. When Ngcobo worked as the head of VIP protection services, he was known for being one of the president&rsquo;s most trusted and loyal bodyguards. Police spokesman Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said Ngcobo would bring years of policing experience to the unit.&ldquo;Crime intelligence is a critical environment that needs a leader who is hardworking and experienced, with good leadership qualities.&rdquo; Mothiba also congratulated Ngcobo.
