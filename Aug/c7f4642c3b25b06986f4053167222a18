FOR 13 years, domestic worker Elina Maphanga (56) had dutifully served her former employer, even feeding his dogs when they were hungry.But it seems that counted for nothing when one of the vicious dogs attacked her and the owner didn’t seem to care.Elina told Daily Sun she wanted to be compensated for her injuries and loss of income, but claims her ex-boss didn’t even pay her the full month’s wages.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssGfD_EQk9W3lTtAMe3ecKOhjkI5lbZAGj60BuvWXMfu2B0MB6fSKJxzjYYMS72m4aJ74QaIKlKg_gQdRmC7PK2cigjCPcMtKE8DFiwDxdgRkxFynDEfc6mQsfSavRp2Wc-ANvvmxJDFZtZan3pju4jzOwjR_vD4w_xdRHwB9LnokJw2wg9tvTAVBjka3n54PA3Te44OMeeW-NmhkQIrWESKlwh0jYrCPT9m2SP4aXlMbcqP1Z939M8BXFKt4PhQUo4g5CUdyVN_1twTGEqZcqAoLi9otM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCwRyZGNT15PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He saved my life. “My family would have found my body in pieces.”She said the owner of the dogs wasn’t home at the time of the incident.Elina spent two weeks in hospital and still has gaping wounds which ooze every day.The heartbroken mum said she was grateful to be alive but was no longer able to work as she was in severe pain. Her left leg is now partially paralysed.Police spokesman Captain Mbulaheni Netshivhodza told Daily Sun: “Cops are investigating a case of indirect assault. The suspect has not been arrested yet. Joburg SPCA chief inspector Ronald Ramalata said they couldn’t conduct an investigation as the dog had been shot dead.When Daily Sun contacted Elina’s former employer, he said: “I have nothing to say.”
