THE ANC admitted the controversial Gupta family had made a donation to the ANC but claimed it was small, considering the party&rsquo;s size.But ANC treasurer-general Dr Zweli Mkhize said this didn&rsquo;t clear them from prosecution.He admitted this to journalists at the Progressive Business Forum&rsquo;s Women in Business event yesterday at Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand.He couldn&rsquo;t reveal the amount the family had donated. He said that like any business, the Guptas made a donation and he wrote to them to thank them.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a huge amount if you look at the quantum of the ANC. There was nothing underhanded about it,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want an impression to be created out there that the ANC is funded by the Guptas.&rdquo;Mkhize said as a political organisation, they received donations in good faith and believed that businesspeople made money legally. He said the donations had no conditions attached.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not transferable and no conditions are attached, nor do they offer immunity against any investigation or prosecution associated with irregularities in either the awarding of contract of tenders whether commercial, public sector or state-owned projects,&rdquo; he said.He said neither his office in the ANC nor the party was in any way involved in the web of emails implicating the Guptas and ministers in irregular tenders. &ldquo;We take these matters seriously,&rdquo; he said. The ANC had decided to make party funding reform more transparent, to help parties and society understand donations.
