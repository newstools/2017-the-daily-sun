STUDENTS at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology&rsquo;s Cape Town campus are divided about how to air their grievancesExams were delayed yesterday when the hall where students were meant to start writing was torched overnight.This action, together with protesting students storming the university&rsquo;s management offices, resulted in the university closing campus for the day.Protesting students demanded that the university place them in residences or remain closed. Student representative council chairman Ayakha Magxotwa vowed the university would remain closed until management listened to their demands.&ldquo;We have identified buildings and the university only needs to declare them suitable for student accommodation. The National Student Financial Aid Scheme must pay for the accommodation,&rdquo; said Magxotwa.He claimed students didn&rsquo;t burn the hall. &ldquo;All student leaders were at a meeting on the night of the fire.&rdquo;Acting vice-chancellor Dr Chris Nhlapo issued a statement that read: &ldquo;Protesters forced staff and students out of a number of buildings and started a fire in an office in the multi-purpose hall. &ldquo;In the interests of everyone&rsquo;s safety, classes and other activities on campus have been cancelled for today. Normal operations will continue tomorrow.&rdquo;
