She is grown up. I thought she might have also visited a boyfriend,” Fikile told Daily Sun. “Neither of them ever brought their boyfriends home to meet me. It’s hard, feeling the pain of not knowing where my kids are.” She said if she sees their remains, so she can bury them, it may bring her peace.Buyisile’s twin sister, Bulelwa, is battling to sleep at night. She keeps dreaming about Sanele walking past her in the street.“I dream of Sanele wanting to talk to my mum. I don’t dream about my twin.” Fikile has appealed to SunReaders to help find her daughters. Missing person’s cases have been opened at Tsakane cop shop.
