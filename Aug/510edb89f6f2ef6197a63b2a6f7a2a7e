In January a 14-year-old girl from Baziya was forced to marry a 28-year-old man.She was tricked by family members, who told her she was going to get a new school uniform. They forced her into traditional wedding clothes before telling her she had become a wife.When the case went to court, community members admitted practising ukuthwala, but said the girl had agreed to it. Majola said: “No one has the right to decide another person’s future. We are saying girls should be married at the right age and with their permission.“The parents’ responsibility is to send their children to school.” He told boys the days of ukuthwala were over and they needed to ask girls out. Villagers complained to the cops that cases of ukuthwala and rape had been reported, but the culprits were never punished. “The cops are not helping us. I have reported cases of stock theft and break-ins in vain,” said Mthobeli Ntotsho.
