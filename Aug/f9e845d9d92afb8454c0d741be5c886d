WHEN Simon Maswanganyi bought a horse, his life changed for the better. But today his business, fetching water and firewood with his donkey cart, has been destroyed. A jilted lover allegedly killed four of his donkeys and his horse!The man apparently acted in revenge after his girlfriend left him for Simon. Simon, from Makapanstad, North West said he used to ride his horse, with his girlfriend, around the village. &ldquo;Her ex would often beg her to get off the horse and come back to him but she refused,&rdquo; he claimed. Simon said he was having a few beers with friends on Friday when young boys came running to tell him the man was killing his donkeys and horse with an axe. He said he reported the matter to the man&rsquo;s family and they promised to replace his animals. The man&rsquo;s sister, Elisabeth Rikhotso, confirmed to Daily Sun that they would replace Simon&rsquo;s livestock. Inspector Meshack Matlou of the SPCA said Simon should open a case against the man.
