PHILEMON Makatu is in so much pain he cannot walk. This is because he was hit by a car and dragged behind it, allegedly by the driver who was furious because Philemon didn’t have dagga to sell to him! The 39-year-old from Braamfischerville in Soweto told Daily Sun the incident happened at a garage in Bedfordview, Joburg, where he works, early on Saturday morning. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuf9mz-ykZ8eZjdCM5lRdEMayUTKWuPFAQroK2Qzc1JrD6G0gsUxQd2J1FwAsuFhrkNIWEvHT7K_GVxz3_xy_SahtmDwZHtqvd1MJg-1dRbpKBsP4cALnedkfpi7DVVL1HU7kcpSUcwiBgqaKKlc3bJYpQTH7E2y_QyaCtQyf_ULsjUDlF5qaduurWk_OTjgQr6cOlElVYKldFNDlnxCEi-hG1DbgXxsdCPfN9seA2xanc45jJBnp2JEj1uC4ZwOoxUAi0tcAqS1sTwBLgpFgw4Pxqq2sE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEyC0Of52EvCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When Philemon said he didn’t sell weed, the man started shouting at him before asking to go to the toilet. “He went to the toilet for more than 45 minutes. When he came back and we asked him what he had been doing, he said he had bought bread and cigarettes,” he said. Philemon said when he pointed out that the man had not bought anything, he started hitting him. “The man then parked at one of the pumps as if he wanted his tank filled. I walked over to tell my colleague in charge of the pump but the man suddenly drove his car towards me and hit me. “I was stuck under his car but he kept driving and hit the wall of the petrol station shop. I managed to crawl away as he reversed.” Philemon said some tow truck drivers saw what was happening and threatened to moer his attacker. “He drove off and the tow trucks gave chase but they couldn’t catch him,” he said. However, the car’s number plate fell off and cops were able to trace him. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a man was arrested and will appear soon for attempted murder.
