NEWLY appointed Free State Stars coach Luc Eymael want to repay the club management with a top eight finish for putting their faith on him.&nbsp;Seeing Sammy Troughton&rsquo;s contract being terminated after two games in the league will bring in a lot of pressure to Eymael but the former Polokwane City and Bloemfontein Celtic mentor is ready to lead Ea Lla Koto to the right direction.&ldquo;It will take time of hard work and a lot of commitment, and I want to thank the board for putting the confidence in me in leading their team and I hope I will repay them with good results,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I also hope that together with my technical team, management, and the players we will work together to achieve more and I am adamant that we will achieve our goal at the end of the season.&rdquo;In reference to the ambitious mandate set upon his appointment, the 57-year-old was blunt in response.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put pressure on myself but I will do my best to put the team in the top-eight and I think if I can succeed with the players we have &ndash; because the coach alone can do nothing.&ldquo;I will try and achieve and bring the best results into Free State Stars as I have done with my previous clubs. I will strive my best to help the team to improve.&rdquo;Eymael conceded it&rsquo;s been a pleasure to return to South Africa after a few months out of the game and his excellent relationship with the club bosses at the Bethlehem based side made the decision to return to the PSL much easier.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be back in South Africa and happy to have signed with Free State Stars.&ldquo;We have a good relationship with the management over the last season and we had good chats. But obviously, it was not about the contract but friendship and about soccer in general,&rdquo; he concluded.
