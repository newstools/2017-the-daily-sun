NOT many men who have been attacked by a lion live to tell the tale, yet Isaac le Roux (48) did.But it seems his story of survival only brought him more problems.That’s because Isaac’s former employer, a farmer at a game lodge between Vryburg and Mahikeng in North West, allegedly refused to compensate him after the ordeal.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstiSmzCXXnp_eJM6CZPKiwyr9LekH4EP5TGQHC-vAfO-2ZnTUOHFMD7_aZUl8s_FlyXNk-42R8dLNTKQJINBquGf4yrgIMuOYp7GBPRhrHOSxZNPEyMSCo2WySUThAKP7rQrm1najvxFLyjFaR6nr1mfc8R644qMO_ORdEcrgzWWmmnCVWYDDvAVcosXEkR44E_Hani_pOTtGvHq5HvodrCrQZZvoKfD-Is0ybcnIGF9lrhIDimTHejuMk-zGAqt2O7kp3KeuvLdgfrlQmZ5UUgj6hrvAU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIjC05E4FCNcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He allegedly kept him at the lodge against his will after stitching his wounds. Isaac said Engelbrecht promised to compensate him on condition he didn’t report the matter. But when Isaac returned to work earlier this year, Engelbrecht allegedly became hostile and broke his promise. Isaac then decided to resign.Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said no case was opened because Isaac darted the lion while on duty. He said Isaac indicated he wanted compensation and was advised about the legal action he can take against the owner.Carel van Heerden, Engelbrecht’s lawyer, said his client was in the process of taking legal action against Isaac and his brother, and declined to comment at this stage.
