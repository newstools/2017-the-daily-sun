We are really angry. The abuse has gone too far and we want it to stop.” The teachers said they reported the principal to the education department but officials were dragging their feet. They said they’ve also had meetings with the school governing body but the principal does not even recognise the body.Education spokesman Gerald Sambo said the matter will be urgently addressed.“The department has learned about the situation at the school. We will send officials there to assess the allegations.“We will try to resolve the dispute so that learning can resume,” he said.
