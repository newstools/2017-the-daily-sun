And I just knew someone was being killed,” said one resident.“I don’t know where the police were during the shooting because they’re always driving up and down the hostel.” Another resident said he flung himself on the bedroom floor when he heard the sound of gunfire.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a man was shot and killed.“There was a fatal shooting in the hostel, and when the police arrived the man was already dead. “He had multiple gunshot wounds,” Zwane told the People’s Paper. Umlazi police have opened a case of murder and no arrests have been made.Zwane urged anyone with information about the shooting incident to report the killers at their nearest cop shop.Meanwhile, Umlazi cops – led by station commander Brigadier Bongi Ntuli – visited the hostel last week to assure residents they were working hard to restore peace.
