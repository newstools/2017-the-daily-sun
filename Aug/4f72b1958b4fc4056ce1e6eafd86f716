WHEN Steve Flick&rsquo;s dad died in 2002, his mum slipped into a horrible depression and was admitted to hospital. Steve was 17 years old then. He went on with his life and soon lost contact with his mum, Lucille. But when Steve tried to find her years later, Lucille was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; Steve thought she might have died but he kept searching. Luckily for him, it turned out that his mum was also searching for him. The two have now been reunited, after 14 long years.&nbsp; The 31-year-old from Rosebank, northern Joburg, told Daily Sun he started believing that his mum was dead after they went their separate ways. When he found a job, he moved to Rosebank to be closer to his workplace. In the meantime, his mum was in a dark place. Steve said after years without his mum, he tried to find her but his search was fruitless.&nbsp; He started to fear that death had taken her too. &ldquo;I almost lost faith but something told me to keep searching,&rdquo; said Steve. &ldquo;I eventually received a message on Facebook from a stranger, asking me questions about my mother.&rdquo; Steve said it soon turned out that the stranger knew his mum, who was also looking for him. &ldquo;The woman told me where to find my mum and I went there and found her! She was living in a home in nearby Yeoville. &ldquo;It was nothing less than pure joy to finally be reunited with my mother,&rdquo; he said. Steve said it was symbolic that he had found his mother just a few days before Mother&rsquo;s Day. &ldquo;It was a fabulous feeling to celebrate the first Mother&rsquo;s Day with her in 14 years.&rdquo; Lucille said she couldn&rsquo;t believe that she had finally been reunited with her only child. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe it when God answered my prayers,&rdquo; she said.
