A family member (29) said she was preparing to take her kids to school yesterday morning when she discovered eight dead chicks at their front door.She said they now believe the appliances were broken by a jealous neighbour.“The black chicks are proof the person who did this wanted us to live in the dark. No one accidentally leaves dead chicks in front of a door.“My three-year-old son kept waking up and crying at night.“I think it was at the time the person dumped the chicks here.”She said they sprinkled disinfectant fluid to chase away the evil spirits and threw the dead chicks in the bush.She said her family needs the services of a strong inyanga who will help them get rid of the bad luck.“Whoever did this is jealous because there is no man in this house, yet we are able to live a comfortable life.”Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said: “The chicks will bring more bad luck if the family doesn’t act quickly. “They should get an inyanga to do a cleansing ceremony for them.”
