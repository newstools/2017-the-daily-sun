MURDERED Methodist Bishop Thembinkosi Fandaleki&rsquo;s funeral was held in Mount Frere yesterday. Speakers at the event held at the Madzikane Sports Ground said Fandaleki was a dedicated leader who served people with love. His funeral was also attended by other Methodist bishops, pastors, church members, Premier Phumulo Masualle, OR Tambo mayor Nomakhosazana Meth and Alfred Nzo mayor Sixolile Mehlomakulu. Fandaleki was shot dead in the Mthatha CBD last Monday. His daughter, Nomzamo (34), said her father was being buried on his birthday. As she spoke about him, her three sisters wept. &ldquo;My father was no ordinary father. On the day before he died, he called us all and told us he loved us. &ldquo;His purpose in this world was filling every heart with love and touching every sad soul,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our prayer is that his blood was not spilled in vain and justice will be done for him. We are not crying because we know our God will fight our battles.&rdquo;Masualle said: &ldquo;Fandaleki was not only a father to his family, he was also a dad to the poor and needy. &ldquo;He was always fighting for the rights of those who were victimised. This country has lost a great leader.&rdquo;
