HLOMPHO KEKANA is not a man of many words.&nbsp;But the disappointment in the voice of the Mamelodi Sundowns captain is almost palpable when he talks about losing the MTN8 Cup and the league championship last season.&nbsp;It was a case of so close yet so far for Downs, as they lost the top-eight final to Bidvest Wits, and later got derailed by Maritzburg United in their quest for the major PSL title.&nbsp;&ldquo;We came very close last season but couldn&rsquo;t win. But as a team we&rsquo;ve learned a lot from that experience.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only outstanding trophy and it&rsquo;s our responsibility to deliver it.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve set it as one of our goals this season,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Together with his teammates, Kekana has a chance to go further this season and clinch the R8&thinsp;million prize trophy, a competition they haven&rsquo;t won in a decade.&nbsp;To that end, though, they will first have to see off Maritzburg, whom they meet today in the last of the four MTN8 Cup quarterfinals matches at Lucas Moripe Stadium (3pm).&nbsp;The Brazilians were widely thought to be have been focusing much on Caf Champions League at the time they faced Wits in the final, amid a hectic fixture schedule also involving the Absa Premiership campaign.&nbsp;They may face a similar challenge this season with a potential clash of dates between the two-legged top-eight semifinal tie and the Champions League quarterfinals.&nbsp;Said Kekana: &ldquo;We had this programme last season and we did well under pressure. I think it&rsquo;s going to be the same this year.&nbsp;&ldquo;As a team we really need to be in good shape and manage our squad well. We want to do well in every competition we take part in.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maritzburg can be dangerous, especially away from home.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen two of their preseason matches and know how they play.&nbsp;&ldquo;We know their strengths and will prepare accordingly.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never won this trophy. I&rsquo;ve always dreamt about winning it. The team also want it.&rdquo;&nbsp;United may have lost their inspirational skipper, Kurt Lentjies, who has since joined Chippa United.&nbsp;But they still have powerful weapons to bring into the battle and achieve Kekana&rsquo;s big dream.&nbsp;Among the danger men they have on tap, there are influential midfielder Deolin Mekoa and striker Evans Rusike, who&rsquo;s on the radar of several top clubs.&nbsp;
