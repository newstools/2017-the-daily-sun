LINDOKUHLE Sithathu chose death rather than face his maths teacher! On Tuesday the 11-year-old grade 6 pupil was found hanging from the ceiling of the garage at his home in his school uniform. The pupil at Richards Bay Primary School, on the KZN North Coast, apparently hanged himself because he was scared to tell his maths teacher he had lost his textbook. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvkYhIHkqiYa94kQea7ofAAQ-XnWSc9SPvMAes02wvCR-Hof7PORnYlz4NqqI4cWYLWy2XdVaK_QWm1cf3SU2_V1ca7_p7pSxr35InldGOwea9D1w7S5mptmcW2v4gkL4p5S9r9XLWu8DU9WiaJXFs2YWv767LWynA0R3LHbNsndlTVaXg1DK15Cr7L_TMCrM0aDdsDeXN8-HZzHcqZhT37iXYd6aq59MlvGqqpOV2AWi4oc4sRGidPbyG91Au8p4mlVhielYZe7p1g6WrE5GWZArLqR6g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE0XG17fH39jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When we asked him what was wrong, he said the teacher was going to humiliate him and make him feel stupid,” claimed Lungi. She said on the day of Lindokuhle’s death, she told him to go to school with a letter promising the family would replace the book. “I was sleeping when he was getting ready for school and I was woken by the screams of a family member who found him hanging in the garage.”Lungi said there was a suicide letter in Lindokuhle’s pocket. It read: “My family, please blame the teacher for taking my life. He made me feel useless. I love you mum.” Lindokhule’s mum, Simphiwe, said she wanted the teacher to be removed from the school. Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KZN Education Department, said: “We would like to pass our condolences to the boy’s family and classmates. We are not going to speculate about what happened but we will investigate.” Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. “An inquest docket was opened at Esikhaleni cop shop after an 11-year-old boy was found hanging at his home on Tuesday. Cops are investigating the matter.”
