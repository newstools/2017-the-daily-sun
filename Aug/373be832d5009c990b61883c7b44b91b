FORMER Bloemfontein Celtic and Golden Arrows head coach, Khabo Zondo, has described the current Ke Yona team as special, and says they will surprise many when they play Nedbank Cup champions, SuperSport United, next weekend.&nbsp;The Ke Yona team was selected from thousands of young aspiring footballers in every corner of Mzansi. And they&rsquo;ve been preparing for this encounter for the past five months.&nbsp; And the time for them to show Mzansi what they&rsquo;re made of has finally arrived.&nbsp;The Ke Yona team, which is led by a quartet of coaches that includes SA&rsquo;s Under-23 coach Owen da Gama, former Bafana Bafana mentor Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba, Mike &ldquo;Sporo&rdquo; Mangena, and Zondo, will tackle Matsatsantsa A Pitori for the second time in a row this coming Sunday at Makhulong Stadium (3.30pm).This is the fifth year of the Nedbank Ke Yona team project. The coaches are going into this game hoping for glory, as they&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t won the cup in the past four years.Last year Ke Yona team gave a good fight when they were defeated by Matsatsantsa 1-0.&nbsp;This time around they want to make history by winning for the first time.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have only one week remaining for this game. We will use it to prepare the boys mentally and technically.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something different about this year&rsquo;s team. These youngsters are dedicated and I can say if SuperSport give us their B team &ndash;&ensp;they&rsquo;ll be in trouble!&rdquo; said Zondo. The 18 players have been already drafted into Absa Premiership clubs. They will go into this encounter knowing that the teams they&rsquo;ve been drafted into will be watching. And that might put them under pressure.Zondo admitted that there is pressure. &ldquo;Each and every player, even the professional players, are always under pressure. Now it&rsquo;s up to us as the coaches to prepare them well. I&rsquo;m confident half of this team will get professional contracts,&rdquo; he said.
