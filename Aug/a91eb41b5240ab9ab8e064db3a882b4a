KZN EDUCATION MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane is expected to visit Richards Bay Secondary School today following the violence at the school. The violent incident was recorded in a shocking 11, second video in which a group of pupils is seen attacking each other on the premises, with other pupils cheering.The department alleged some pupils had knives and guns and gunshots were fired. Dlungwane said he strongly condemned the violence because schools should be the centres of learning and teaching, not sites of bullying, gangs and criminality.He said he was calling on teachers, parents and residents to unite and stand against violence at schools.&ldquo;Even if we installed state-of-the-art security in our schools, we won&rsquo;t win the war against school violence.&ldquo;Parents and communities must come on board and take responsibility for instilling a sense of what is right and wrong in their children.&rdquo; He said schools shouldn&rsquo;t be the only place where children are taught morals. Dlungwane said they were angered by the violent behaviour at the school and will not rest until they identify the culprits and bring them to book. He said bullying is one of the causes of violent crime at schools, and forms part of the safety challenges schools face.It directly undermines the creation of a safe school environment that supports personal growth and development.Attempts to get comment from the SGB were unsuccessful.
