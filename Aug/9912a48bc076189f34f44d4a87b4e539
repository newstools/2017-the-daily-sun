SIMON Balangile was orphaned in his early teens and had to live under a bridge. After he had finished begging for the day, he&rsquo;d walk along streets lined with nice mansions, admiring the large double storey houses in Queenstown, Eastern Cape. Today, the 44-year-old from Tambo section near Westonaria has built his own mkhukhu mansion! &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve realised that life is what you make of it rather than what life is supposed to do for you,&rdquo; the wise Simon told Daily Sun.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m up there in my house, I&rsquo;m able to see people walking in the street. &ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ve now become a proud man. I&rsquo;m equal to all God&rsquo;s people.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t be fooled by Simon&rsquo;s achievements . . .&nbsp; He respects the other shack dwellers, his neighbours!&nbsp; The father of five kids said it took him more than three months to plan and build his comfortable double storey house.&nbsp; Originally from the little farming village of Dordrecht, Simon said a madala called Baaba Balangile rescued him. &ldquo;Baaba Balangile took me away from the street and raised me to&nbsp;become strong. I thank him. He was a godsend,&rdquo; he said. Simon said he teaches kasi kids to be lovers, not fighters. &ldquo;Since I moved into my mansion, I&rsquo;ve developed a sense of inner peace,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&nbsp; And building the mkhukhu has awakened an ambition in the unemployed man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d appreciate it if any business or local government could help me improve my building skills,&rdquo; said Simon. He thanked God for all his achievements.
