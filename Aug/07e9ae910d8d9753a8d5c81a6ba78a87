commission found that Uhuru Kenyatta and his party won the polls by 54% of the votes,
while Raila Odinga’s party got 45% of the votes.The National Super Alliance (Nasa), headed by veteran
politician Odinga (72), claims to have evidence of “massive irregularities” in
the voting process and has challenged the result in court.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss0yTs55JPKq_WQS9yN-h1Hl_3vhBKQxRoWn-oLt_3ODzS4pg7QVuSOBFhLFxPcxuDmDq3iGNOnVfZ_szmmjd8Dl_BSYzm4L-RCsDJTWYnLUXnKch50o6PNmv29AF_sDhB3N8k0FAC87GCSl1U2LtEpYX37HOdv9vRQdnSPNn20D-oPiLv2tEP78EimgyGoXyafTp3EBkkC8Cx9kQ8sihRJbKk9Ai-yoRuXbRVbnMDZHSKi1I328RYLv658YUdlyTg4ctU5lKmbsmZSiNJvPuD9crw1OUO2vmQaEA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGXwkkZ6n4khEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

electoral commission was mysteriously found dead just days before the election,
allegedly with torture marks on his body. This was seen as particularly
threatening to fair elections because of the new electronic system Kenya used
to register votes. There were fears that the electronic system may have been
hacked.The voting went off with little violence, but panic gripped the
cities of Kenya. Nobody has forgotten the tragic and bloody aftermath of the
contested 2007 elections, in which about 1 200 people were killed and 600 000
displaced.According to the Daily
Nation, the AU asked all political parties and their supporters “to avoid
making irresponsible statements or engaging in actions meant to incite violence
and destroying the prevailing peace in Kenya”.
