ZIMBABWE’S ruling Zanu-PF party has called for a march in
Harare today in support of Grace Mugabe, who has been in hot water since
moering a young South African woman two weeks ago.Grace beat 20-year-old South African model Gabriella
Engels with an extension cord, severely injuring her. Engels had been hanging
out in a Sandton hotel room with one of Mugabe’s sons, Bellarmine Chatunga.Following a police report by Engels, Mugabe was granted
diplomatic immunity by South African authorities in a move that was criticised
by human rights organisations in both Zimbabwe and South Africa.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssXIl93Csa_m6LpMuKWy4L6YQ1-6V9qI7BJfvmzjr-XMr2zXQgzmQJ9xE1En9z-ADp6db-io7yXHtsfxpVxN8Hqy3n5NQclPzOuN7x4H3RzDdRBEay0zK9rDs2ZcLxBE5cEx3tZP8KMTD032-sn3_RK2lkxAfZlk8eV6taps2Sz3m6U_R9VOKkklnYQTXjLHU3wDVPw-g0Fjmu6fiqs2IuGIyR5qAwEhUBn4xin3Jz_MYxis8sKUrVAAZJ1UWqws2IA7FxjT_FEq5dm0tloScJTxOsbyo-HVphE8g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ8KmVVLiIroEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Shadreck Mashayamombe, said the procession would finish with a rally at the
party's headquarters in downtown Harare.President Mugabe and his wife were expected to address
the Zanu-PF supporters, who were reportedly being brought in from all the
country’s provinces.Zimbabwe's main opposition Movement for Democratic Change
party led by  Morgan Tsvangirai and other
civic groups criticised the planned procession and rally ."Every sane person out there knows that Zimbabwe is
run by a deeply entrenched and fascist Zanu-PF dictatorship fronted by Robert
Mugabe. Instead of organising a so-called solidarity rally in support of Grace
Mugabe, [they] should actually be organising a demonstration against violence;
particularly violence against women and the girl child," said MDC
spokesperson Obert Gutu."The whole world knows that Grace Mugabe brutally
assaulted a young woman aged 20, Gabriella Engels, in South Africa, a few weeks
ago. Grace is the aggressor and Engels is the victim. Where in the decent and
normal world would you get a solidarity march being organised in support of a
violent and aggressive bully? Chimene doesn't sound like she is in control of
her faculties." http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/solidarity-march-rally-for-grace-mugabe-on-today-after-sa-assault-scandal-20170830
