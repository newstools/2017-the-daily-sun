SIPHELELE &ldquo;Stash&rdquo; Ntshangase says he will use the 2018 African Nations Championship (Chan) qualifiers against Zambia as a platform to regain his form and attract Premier Soccer League (PSL) teams.&nbsp;The first leg of the final round takes place at the Buffalo City Stadium, in East London, Eastern Cape, on Saturday (3pm).The Black Leopards midfielder wants to become a regular in Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s squad.He also wants to market himself as Lidoda Duvha boss, David Thidiela, has given him the green light to join any PSL team with a good deal.Baxter has kept the bulk of the squad that beat Botswana 2-0 away and 1-0 at home in the first round of qualifiers.&nbsp;The overall winner will be among the 16 teams that will compete in the finals scheduled for Kenya from 11 January to 2 February next year.&nbsp;Bafana players will assemble for camp today.Said Ntshangase: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always an honour for me to represent my country. I&rsquo;ve been in this situation before and I know what to do.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to grow as a player and whatever happens after that I&rsquo;ll take it as it comes.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ntshangase is aware it won&rsquo;t be easy to overcome Chipolopolo, who are still reeling after losing the Cosafa Cup to Zimbabwe, who thrashed them 3-1 in the final played in Rustenburg, North West, last month.&nbsp;Said Ntshangase: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen Zambia in action before, what I know is that they consist of local based players.&nbsp;&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the same as Botswana, but what&rsquo;s important for us is to win the game.&nbsp;&ldquo;We need to respect our opponent and ensure we convert the chances we create.&rdquo;Ntshangase emphasised that Chan presented local based players with a great opportunity to prove their worth as overseas players are not eligible to play.&nbsp;He went on: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of talented players locally who are yearning for this chance.&nbsp;&ldquo;For us Chan is a big thing as we&rsquo;ll be flying the South African flag high.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a chance for us who are not in the limelight to showcase our talent.&rdquo;Ntshangase, who joined the National First Division side during the 2011/12 season, praised Thidiela for supporting his career during all the ups and downs.&ldquo;Leopards are my family and I always ensure I represent the team in the right way on and off the pitch. We missed promotion on two occasions but if we start collecting points early that will better our chances of gaining automatic promotion,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
