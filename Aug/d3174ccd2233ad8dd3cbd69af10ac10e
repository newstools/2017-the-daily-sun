THE Marikana widows do not want deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa at their fifth commemoration.&ldquo;The widows were clear that they do not want him,&rdquo; Amcu president Joseph Mathunjwa told the media yesterday at a briefing in Rosebank, Joburg. &ldquo;They told us to pass the message to Ramaphosa that he was not welcome in any way at the commemoration.&rdquo;Mathunjwa said he might arrange to meet them at any other time if he wanted, but not now. &ldquo;They are not ready to see him. They do not want him to use this occasion to meet them,&rdquo; he said.The widows have apparently not forgiven Ramaphosa for the role he played in the infamous killing of the 34 miners in August 2012.Mathunjwa suggested the 2012 massacre should be called the Lonmin massacre, because the killings were committed by the mining company in a place called Marikana.He also spoke about what he called a &ldquo;jobs bloodbath&rdquo; in the mining sector, where thousands of people were being retrenched on a regular basis.He said the gold sector was the most affected when it came to diseases such as silicosis and that miners were dying in large numbers.He said they were going to fight for the miners in the gold sector. &ldquo;Gold miners must be prepared to fight. It is better to fight before you are dead.&rdquo;
