JUNE Zulu left his home 17 years ago and now wants to be reunited with his family. The 53-year-old, originally from Ermelo in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun he had been living in Tshwane since he left home to look for work. The father of five said in the beginning he enjoyed living on his own, doing piece jobs, but his life had become a misery.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvCvWhweEYw4gZTZZuU5fysJoCGTZKuuq0eCoRju4ZP81xVcC3DHrScm_qBJBlO2Dfj0xyJzyAdq8WinXKuQbBCAJriVtCGLGFnUJvbsuForTa4-RAV8jU5COCqozUo3Ihgaar3cC4hnEd-BHOkIbPTo9IVwgY2gjNl7e7r9K7EgeTkzoxldVlP63tAAU4M_IvY6mKvCJ4WnFxeRad-FAGN3CLYoXVMfO-ijTwdil_G1eOJnci-vjYH_UAjiHBfzwA6e0SS2bGspqHvasXGREM6pfKiNHg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCziJXQyj7qeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Ever since then I have not been able to contact my family.” He said he had survived for the last 10 years thanks to the help of his friend Mandy Tlaka (52). “I know I was wrong for leaving my family but I need them now and hope they will be able to welcome me back.” Mandy said John only told him about his family in June after he had two fingers amputated.“I decided to contact the People’s Paper for help. Hopefully his family will see this article. It’s not easy to see a man so distant from his family, with no money.” If you know where June’s family is, call Daily Sun on 012 485 9251.
