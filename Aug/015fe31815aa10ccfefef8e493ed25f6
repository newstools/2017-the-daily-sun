BEING an Uber driver has become a deadly job. Another driver has been shot dead.The incident allegedly took place on Monday night.An SMS circulated on the Uber driver&rsquo;s WhatsAPP group revealed that the victim&rsquo;s body was found dumped at an off-ramp in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, near the N12 highway.The dead driver&rsquo;s car was later traced to Chris Hani squatter camp, a few minutes&rsquo; drive away from where his body was found.Daveyton police said a case of murder was opened.The drivers speculate that the murdered driver could have taken a cash client.One driver said: &ldquo;It must have been a cash trip. People who pay cash are hard to trace and they rob and kill us.&rdquo; He said drivers were now considering refusing to take cash payments for their own safety.Alon Lits, general manager for Uber in Sub-Saharan Africa, said they couldn&rsquo;t comment on issues of criminality but could only speak of their safety measures. Lits said one incident was one too many, but said they were not the police.Meanwhile, police have arrested a suspect in the case of the Uber driver who was attacked with acid earlier this month.
