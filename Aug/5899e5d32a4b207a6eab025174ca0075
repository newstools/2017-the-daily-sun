A MINORITY party leader in Bushbuckridge has trashed an ANC food and blanket hand-out because he claims ANC Mayor Sylvia Nxumalo is trying to take the ward away from him. "I am the councillor of this ward and I don't like that the mayor can come and host events without engaging me. It is clear that they have intentions to steal my followers," Bushbuckridge Residents Association (BRA) leader Delta Mokoena said."The mayor should have shown respect and consulted with me first and even suggested with respect that she is in an outreach programme and that she will also be coming to my ward," said Mokoena.BRA supporters collapsed the tent where the executive mayor was set to conduct her hand out. They also threw bricks at the gathering crowd.The stampede was minimised by the presence of police who stood as barricades between the mayor's team and BRA members. No one was arrested at the scene. Mokoena calmed his supporters.Nxumalo proceeded with donations of blankets to the elderly as well as food parcels. The mayor said that she was doing an outreach in the name of Nelson Mandela. "We just came from the Mandela Month and as a mayor I am responsible for it and all the wards in Bushbuckridge, and this event today is part of our outreach programme," she said.During the 2011 local government elections, BRA managed to win seven seats in the Bushbuckridge local council, which is made up of 74 seats. BRA became the second most voted for party in the local municipality, but won only ward 15 of the many wards under the municipality.Mokoena won most of his votes in ward 15 and through such domination; five other wards were also later born. "I cannot be broken; the strength of the votes accumulated in ward 15 will continue to spread throughout [the] entire province, God willing.''The Bushbuckridge executive mayor's governance is the kind that rapes its people with dirty ideology and support it with cheap blankets handed over to the elderly within the ward," said Mokoena.''David Mabuza (premier) also showed me the same disrespect in 2013 and I chased him out for planning a campaign without consulting with me," he said.&nbsp;
