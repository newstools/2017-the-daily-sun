It’s boring without you,” she pleads. He said he was tempted to agree to join his lover of 15 years, but he refused and then woke up.“I fear that the day I agree I won’t wake up.” Amos told the People’s Paper that Daizy hadn’t been buried yet.“She had three children, and she always told me about them. “I want them to be there when she is laid to rest,” said madala Amos. “That’s the last thing I want to do for her.” And then he wants her to stop calling him.“If I join her now, her children will never know what happened to their mother.” Midvaal Councillor Peter Teixeira confirmed the madala didn’t want to bury the gogo without her relatives, but said they were prepared to help him with the funeral arrangements.
