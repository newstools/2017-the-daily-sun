SUPERSPORT United head coach Eric Tinkler labelled his side&rsquo;s MTN8 quarterfinal victory over Kaizer Chiefs as a massive win for the team.The Tshwane outfit beat the Soweto giants 1-0 to go through to the two-legged semifinal in a match played at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday. This victory was Tinkler&rsquo;s first as United coach and a repeat of what he did last season after taking charge of Cape Town City. At the same stage of the same competition last year, Tinkler beat Chiefs by a single goal to book City a ticket to the semifinal.&nbsp;And on Saturday Tinkler did it again when Jeremy Brockie scored in the first half. The coach said this win would go a long way in preparing his lads for a bumper season ahead.&nbsp;Said Tinkler: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a massive, massive win for us. We knew facing Chiefs would not be easy &ndash; I watched them play Orlando Pirates a couple of weeks ago. They were playing a high tempo game and I thought we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to keep up with them.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are at least two to three weeks behind in terms of pre-season preparations. So we knew that in order for us to have a go against them we needed to keep it tight at the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our game plan was to let them come at us and hit them on the counter, and it worked for us. We got one chance, we used it and we scored.&rdquo;The former Pirates coach said this win was a big boost for them ahead of two tough opening Absa Premiership matches. They host their Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday and play Chiefs again, this time at FNB Stadium, four days later.&nbsp;Said Tinkler: &ldquo;I will take a lot of positives from this Chiefs win ahead of the league kick-off. We knew we had do well against them, seeing that our next opponents are a strong Sundowns team.&nbsp;&ldquo;We also needed this boost because we face Chiefs again just a few days after Sundowns. So yes, this is a big, big boost for me and the players.&rdquo;
