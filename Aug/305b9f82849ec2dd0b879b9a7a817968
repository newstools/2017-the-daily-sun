When the SunTeam visited the beach at Reunion Park yesterday, it was quiet on the shore. A few people had parked their cars several metres from the beach. Beachgoer Siyabonga Mfeka (34) said he wanted to have a quick surf with his kids but lifeguards turned them away. “They told us it wasn’t safe for us to surf and the conditions would remain the same for the next few days.” KZN Sharks Board spokesman Mike Anderson-Reade said: “We can confirm some of the beaches in eThekwini will be closed due to rough seas, but we will only issue a detailed statement today.”Weather forecaster Stacy Colborne said: “Rough seas will be visible tomorrow and on Friday, caused by strong regional winds.” KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, also issued a weather alert regarding the development of an intense weather system that will result in extreme cold weather, snow and heavy rain from today.She said: “We are urging all residents to be cautious as many areas will be affected, resulting in reduced visibility on the roads.”
