A TAVERN boss from Phola in Masoyi, outside White River, Mpumalanga, appeared in court on Thursday.He was charged with the attempted murder of a former employee. His former worker, Carlos Ntimba (20), said he was kidnapped after being promised a new job.Carlos told the SunTeam from his hospital bed that on 28 February he received a call from a person claiming to have found him a new job in Emalahleni. &ldquo;The caller even sent R130 to Shoprite for travel costs. It was collected by my wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I arrived in Nelspruit at about 6pm, the caller told me he could no longer come to pick me up as it was late. &ldquo;He asked me to go KaNyamazane and said his friends would take me to him the next morning. I believed him.&rdquo; But that never happened. Instead, as he stood waiting on the street, he said he was grabbed by three men and bundled into a blue Toyota Corolla driven by his former boss!&ldquo;The four men tied up my hands and legs with rope.&ldquo;They started assaulting me with a giant hammer and punching me with their fists.&ldquo;They accused me of stealing liquor from my boss&rsquo; tavern. They continued assaulting me and poured acid on me until I passed out,&rdquo; said Carlos. Police spokeswoman Captain Jabu Ndubane said: &ldquo;A male victim was hospitalised after being found by police dumped in the bushes with severe injuries to the upper body.&ldquo;A businessman was arrested and appeared briefly in the Nelspruit Regional Court, charged with attempted murder.&rdquo;
