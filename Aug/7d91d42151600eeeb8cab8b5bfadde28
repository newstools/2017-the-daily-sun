Maritzburg United have completed the signing of ex-Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Siyanda Xulu. The lanky defender who was unveiled on Thursday morning signed a three-year deal with the team of choice as a free agent following his recent exit from Chiefs. The Bafana Bafana International will be hoping to revive his career after a difficult two years spell at Chiefs, where he failed to break into the starting line-up under coach Steve Komphela. Xulu made his breakthrough into the professional ranks in 2009-10 season at Mamelodi Sundowns. He had a outstanding season with the Brazilians which saw him winning a move to FC Rostov in the Russian Premier League, where he spent three seasons before cutting his time short over unpaid salaries. Chiefs won the race for his signature on his return to the PSL, which coincided with the arrival of Komphela at the club. Komphela, who ironically gave Xulu his Bafana debut against Gabon in 2012, opted for other players though, and gave the defender just a single outing in the whole of last season. Xulu is the seventh signing made by United so far in this window after goalkeeepers Richard Ofori and Jethren Barr, defenders Rushine de Reuck and Motsie Matima, and midfielders Mxolisi Kunene and Australian Liam Youlley.
