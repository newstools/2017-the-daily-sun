BLACK First Land First (BLF) leader Andile Mngxitama says he is looking forward to exposing Western Cape's Premier Helen Zille as "ill-informed, ignorant, arrogant" and someone who "does not know anything about the history of civilisation"."Africans had universities when white people were still running naked in Europe, beating each other with clubs over the head and eating raw fish," Mngxitama said outside the Western Cape High Court today after postponement of the BLF case at the Equality Court regarding Zille's recent tweets on colonialism.The postponement was to allow complaints lodged with the South African Human Rights Commission and Public Protector to be handled.The BLF approached the Public Protector because Zille&rsquo;s legal representation was paid for by the Western Cape government.Mngxitama said this was an abuse of state resources as Zille was being taken to the Equality Court in her personal capacity, since the tweets came from her private Twitter handle.Zille&rsquo;s spokesman, Michael Mpofu, said the provincial government was paying for her advocate, as the BLF complaint had been laid against the Premier of Western Cape and not Zille in her private capacity.He laughed at Mngxitama&rsquo;s description of Zille as "ill-informed, ignorant and arrogant&rdquo;.Mngxitama said he would advise the BLF's lawyers to suspend the racism complaint at the SAHRC and the probe by the Public Protector, as it had more faith in the Equality Court to handle its complaint."We are very clear - this is about racism. Colonialism is about land theft," he said as a number of BLF supporters stood on the steps of the High Court.Returning from a trip to Singapore on March 16, Zille tweeted: "For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc." She apologised and said she was not defending or justifying colonialism, just saying that not all of its consequences were purely negative. Mngxitama said it was the erasure of black people&rsquo;s achievements and identities. The matter was postponed to October 9.
