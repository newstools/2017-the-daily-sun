&ldquo;THE municipality is taking business opportunities away from us!&rdquo; This was the frustration voiced by angry members of the Sundays River Valley Business Forum in Kirkwood yesterday morning as they took to the streets.The forum members marched to the municipal offices to hand over a 16-point petition to mayor Nombulelo Hawu.They demanded answers within 14 days.Protest leader Andrew Williams read the petition in front of the mayor and said they demanded land, and that the tendency by procurement officials to give quotes to non-locals had to stop.&ldquo;The municipality established this forum so people could have a share in the wealth of the valley,&rdquo; said Andrew. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not happening. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have clear policies talking about the development of the people of the valley!&rdquo;&ldquo;We first want to be ensured of our participation before any project can be approved.&rdquo; Andrew said they also wanted the speaker to be removed, claiming he was interfering in their businesses. &ldquo;The speaker was canvassing for a paralegal structure even though there&rsquo;s already an existing business forum in the valley,&rdquo; he claimed. Forum secretary Thulisa Tose said: &ldquo;Our 56-member structure was started last year, but the speaker had been knocking on business owners&rsquo; doors, requesting them to join his forum.&ldquo;He uses a local ward councillor to further his interests and wants to establish a 100-member forum.&rdquo; Chairman of the forum, Club Jovuka, said corruption was rife in the valley. &ldquo;Last month Deputy Minister of Energy Thembi Majola had an event in Patterson where R1,2 million was lavished on tender towards catering, tents, transport and a PA system but local people were not invited to tender.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who tendered were the speaker&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; said Jovuka. Mayor Hawu signed the petition and said she&rsquo;d look at it clause by clause. &ldquo;We will answer within 14 days,&rdquo; she told protesters.
