THE #UniteBehind coalition took to the streets of Cape Town yesterday afternoon in a bid to put pressure on MPs to oust President Jacob Zuma during today's motion of no confidence in Parliament.The coalition, which is made up of more than 20 community, activist and faith-based organisations, marched from Keizersgracht Street to Parliament.During the march, parliamentary National Speaker Baleka Mbete announced that the motion of no confidence in Zuma will culminate in a secret ballot.Some of the marchers expressed their opinions on the issue: Henri Fredericks, a member of an NGO called Surplus People Project, said: "We want democracy. We have lost track of Mandela's vision. Their (the ANC's) leadership is only for them."Fiona Scorgie, an anthropologist, said she was marching because "I care for my country and our president has betrayed us all! He is corrupted and it is evident. I am here as part of civil society to call for a change.""I am done with corruption; enough is enough," said student Luvuyo Mgodo.Another marcher, Mpumi Mamtanga, the Western Cape head of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), said: "I am an activist. I help people. We feel that with all that is happening in this country, the ones feeling the bad impacts are the poorest. Now we feel that if the ANC cannot recall Zuma, we should remind them that 11 million people voted for them and they should put citizens first and not politicians."Rod Salomon, leader of the SAFirst Forum, said: "We want to tell members of Parliament and President Jacob Zuma we are really unhappy with the situation in South Africa."
