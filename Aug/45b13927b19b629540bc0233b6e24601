MZANSI is facing a shocking new spike in crime at the moment, especially in cases of hijackings. According to the Institute of Security Studies (ISS), the number of hijackings reported has increased a shocking 53% over the last five years. From April to December 2016, an average of 46,3 cars were hijacked each day in South Africa, up 15% from the prior period. This is despite the massive SAPS budget of R87 billion. &ldquo;With almost 195 000 employees, the SAPS is now one of the largest policing agencies in the world. Despite the increase in resources and the expertise, SAPS performance over the past five years has deteriorated significantly,&rdquo; said the ISS. The ISS believes the chaos in police leadership is reversing the gains made in fighting crime since the beginning of democracy. Former police commissioners who have all left under a cloud include Jackie Selebi, Bheki Cele, Riah Phiyega and Khomotso Phahlane. Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba is currently the acting National Police Commissioner.&nbsp; According to car tracking company Ctrack, Volkswagen is the most popular make of passenger car targeted by hijackers. Among makes of SUVs, Toyota is targeted most often. Nissan tops the hijacked truck list.
