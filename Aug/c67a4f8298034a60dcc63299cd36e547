THE ANC national executive committee has set aside the provincial executive committee's decision to disband the leadership of the party's Dullah Omar region in Western Cape.The regional executive was disbanded by the provincial African National Congress after a meeting ahead of the party's national policy conference was disrupted and police were called.The Dullah Omar region and three others in the province then convened a media briefing objecting to the decisions taken by the provincial executive committee.The Dullah Omar region - which is the biggest in Western Cape and includes the Cape Town metropole - appealed against its dissolution with the party's highest decision-making body between conferences - the NEC."The appeal of the regional executive committee of the Dullah Omar region against their dissolution is upheld and the regional executive committee is reinstated," ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said yesterday.He said the NEC had taken the decision at its ordinary NEC meeting last Friday, 28 July, ahead of the NEC lekgotla to prepare for the mid-term budget. Mantashe said the decision to reinstate the region followed visits by the top six to all regions in the province. They found that all the six regions were "deeply divided".Neither the PEC nor the Dullah Omar executive escaped criticism. Mantashe said the PEC was "weak and divided" while the Dullah Omar region was not made up of "angels".Mantashe said the party would be sending leaders to the province to explain its decisions.
