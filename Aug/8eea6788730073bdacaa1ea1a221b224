The department told Daily Sun: “We have a national policy on the prevention and management of pupil pregnancy. “It focuses on the high rate of pregnancy among South African pupils.” The department was not clear on reported cases of statutory rape against pupils. I t only reports on sexual offences reported to the police! Meanwhile, the DA said it wanted to submit parliamentary questions about schoolgirl pregnancies. The party wanted to find out if the girls were under the age of 16. In Mzansi, statutory rape occurs when a person has sex with someone who is younger than 16.  And if this were the case, the DA also wanted to know whether rape charges had been brought against the perpetrators. The law states that kids aged 15 or younger cannot agree to have sex, and that such activity may result in prosecution for statutory rape.
