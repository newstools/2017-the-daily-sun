Motorists were diverted to the R103 road as an alternative. Earlier reports revealed that smoke from burning grass was blowing across the highway before the accident, which made it difficult for motorists to see. The police accident units were investigating the incident. Ekurhuleni emergency services spokesman William Ntladi told Daily Sun: “We have recovered two people from one vehicle that was burned beyond recognition after the car caught fire in the pile-up.”
