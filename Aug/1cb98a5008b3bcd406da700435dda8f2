The minister went on to say there must be new mechanisms for women to lay domestic violence claims and police stations must be the frontline.According to the minister crimes against women and all gender based violence are not only plain evil but, also cost government and the economy money.Mbalula announced in May that he would be launching a programme to ensure women were not turned away from police stations, and he will be unveiling it on Friday.#MduduziManana was granted bail R5000 with conditions: not to make any contact with the witnesses. @News24&mdash; Iavan Pijoos (@iavanpijoos) August 10, 2017#MduduziManana: The case was postponed to September 13 for further investigation. @News24&mdash; Iavan Pijoos (@iavanpijoos) August 10, 2017
