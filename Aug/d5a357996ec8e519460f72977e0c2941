How long have we had the Gupta Leaks? “No one has been forced to sign an affidavit. No one has been forced to comment,” she said.“We want our leaders to be accountable and honest. That’s a true democracy.” Addressing the crowd, both Madonsela and Gordhan hit out at state capture.Madonsela urged the public to support whistle-blowers in the fight against corruption. She said for those who speak out, it is a lonely journey.“There are gaps in the laws to protect whistle-blowers. “To have true protection, we have to empower people to know what needs to be done.“What I would like to see is ordinary people writing to parliament and the president about the Access to Information Act.”
