He was allegedly tortured. Anele claimed the cops had searched his house without a warrant, but found nothing. “I was then questioned about the stolen cellphone,” he said. “After the search, they ordered me to go with them to the local cop shop but they drove to a farm, tied me to a tree and undressed me. “They just kept on torturing me until I was bleeding heavily. Cops beat me for no reason.“When they were done, they left me in the open veld. I went to the hospital.” Anele said he tried to open a case at the local cop shop, but officers wouldn’t help him. He then went to the Ladybrand Police Station to open a case. Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini confirmed an assault case was opened and was being investigated.
