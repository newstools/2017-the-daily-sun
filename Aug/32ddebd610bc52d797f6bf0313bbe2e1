WHEN you look at couches made by Monica Gcobo, they look as if they&rsquo;re come straight from a furniture store! The 45-year-old mother of three girls runs Unathi Upholstery at Share Community Development in KwaNobuhle kasi, Uitenhage where she covers and repairs all kinds of couches.Monica, from Khayelitsha, also covers headboards, car seats and ironing boards and believes that the dignity of a house depends on visitors being welcomed with a comfortable seat.She has been running her own business since 2010 after resigning from Woods Upholstery in 2002.She said: &ldquo;When you buy couches in stores these days it&rsquo;s like buying a car. But people can come to my place and buy sofas at reasonable prices.&rdquo;When she was visited by the SunTeam, Monica was carrying a staple gun, one of the many tools she uses.&ldquo;I also collect couches so people who have unwanted furniture can let me know. My clients include pensioners, factory workers, funeral parlours and doctors.&ldquo;When their couches need repairs, they approach me. I fix all kinds of things that need covering.&ldquo;People can come and choose which colour cloth they want,&rdquo; she said.Monica is very proud of her achievements because she creates job opportunities.&ldquo;Those whose cars were deemed unsafe to carry schoolkids can benefit by loading couches and delivering them to my customers.&ldquo;So far I have created three permanent jobs for my staff. Also I have managed to raise three kids, two of whom went to Rhodes University.&rdquo;
