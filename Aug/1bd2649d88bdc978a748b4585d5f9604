COPS spent more than four hours picking up cash scattered all over the road yesterday morning! The money went flying in all directions on the R71 between Tzaneen and Phalaborwa, Limpopo, after a cash-in-transit van was bombed and robbed by 10 heavily armed men. Although a lot of the money was left behind at the scene, the suspects managed to flee with an undisclosed amount. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvttH3PEG7PrtrHky-RNkxFx5f6enMuJIspxrrV26z-ehfYih1d_G20EQvRZl8XfRnG8G5rSGAGYpU9cPsKZ6DZgDoK3AGA2_p6Grr7yK1nidfNTGUydmYSTukxkfjdsDr83v14Cn63aSAIsP0R02SoMRNQdoGSRgbIL_G9eQkO17k23sEv5NlDSO2QgdtZhFl34nwxAQRkWkcWJwGI89ZsFBzOpFxpSzrUOrmYHXMNUO_s6j9iWgxB9nuV1KemyCaj_WHZPOQQtnVj53PKBLFTfdDyH5E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHADJ7L4unZnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The suspects used explosive devices to blow open the vehicle and rob it of its contents. The suspects were driving in a black BMW sedan, a C200 Mercedes-Benz and a white ML Mercedes-Benz, all with unknown registration numbers. Ngoepe said cases of armed robbery and attempted murder were opened and investigations were still continuing. “The provincial tracking team has launched a massive manhunt for the group of men.“We are appealing to anyone with information that could led to the arrest of the suspects to call Brigadier James Espach on 082 576 0743, Captain Sotlo Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or 08600 10111.” Tips can also be SMSed to Crime Line on 32211.
