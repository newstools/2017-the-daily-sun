THE South African Arts and Culture Youth Forum has lashed out at celebrities and politicians. The forum used Dumi Masilela&rsquo;s memorial service as a platform from which to call out opportunistic celebrities and politicians. This after only a few of them, if any, turned out to attend the late Anthony &ldquo;Tsekeleke&rdquo; Motaung&rsquo;s memorial service held on the same day. Romeo Ramuada, president of the forum, accused Mzansi celebrities of giving their support to only famous and happening people in the industry. Romeo told the packed Hope Restoration Ministries Church that none of the celebrities were at Anthony&rsquo;s memorial held at Rabasotho Community Hall.He said: &ldquo;Tsekeleke&rsquo;s memorial was in the morning, and Dumi&rsquo;s started in the afternoon to give time for people to be able to attend both. Everyone instead flocked here.&rdquo;Romeo accused the celebrities and politicians of living a TV life. &ldquo;They just want to appear on newspapers and televisions. They don&rsquo;t want to contribute to society,&rdquo; said Romeo.&ldquo;They live a life of lies. They just want many followers on their twitter accounts and many likes on their Facebook posts. They don&rsquo;t want to engage and speak anything constructive, and help struggling artists up their game.&rdquo; Romeo said Dumi would not have been happy to see Tsekeleke&rsquo;s memorial attended only by his friends and family. &ldquo;Dumi would be happy to see artists, irrespective of their standing, supporting each other.&rdquo;Those present at Dumi&rsquo;s memorial included Rhythm City&rsquo;s Mduduzi &ldquo;Suffocate&rdquo; Mabaso, Percy Vilakazi, Kaizer Chiefs&rsquo; George Lebese and Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina. Tsekeleke&rsquo;s memorial was attended by his family and old friends from Trompies.
