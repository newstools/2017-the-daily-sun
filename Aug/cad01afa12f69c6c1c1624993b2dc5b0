THE ANC Women&rsquo;s League (ANCWL) has been slapped with a R6&thinsp;million bill in unpaid travel and accommodation expenses for its members, employees and delegates.Last week, the South Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of Atlantis Corporate Travel, a Sandton travel agency, which has been involved in a bitter lawsuit with the ANC&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s wing since April last year over payment for its services. These include air travel, car hire services and Visa services.According to documents seen by the SunTeam this week, the agency would also recover its hefty sum by auctioning the league&rsquo;s assets.The dossier further revealed the two entered into an agreement in February 2013 and the agency dedicated its resources toward the travel needs of the ANCWL, including trips to Japan.Sunday Sun is in possession of invoices of travel arrangements made by the company between 2013 and last year.&ldquo;The plaintiff (Atlantis Corporate Travel) agreed to provide the defendant (ANC Women&rsquo;s League) with a dedicated consultant to service the needs of the defendant, as well as a 24-hour call-in centre.&ldquo;Over the period 7 March 2013 to April 2016 and at Joburg the defendant, trading as the Women&rsquo;s League, placed orders with the plaintiff for the rendering of services,&rdquo; read the document.The company said it provided the league with invoices detailing the amount of the service, but it refused to settle the debt.&ldquo;In breach of the terms of the services agreement, as read with the plaintiff&rsquo;s standard terms and conditions, and despite receipt of the statements and invoices, the defendant failed or refused to pay to the plaintiff the amounts that became due, owing and payable either within a period of 30 days from the date of the plaintiff&rsquo;s statements in each instance or at all.&ldquo;In the premises, the defendant became and remains indebted to the plaintiff in the amount R6,322,600.03 and the plaintiff is entitled to immediate payment of the full amount outstanding,&rdquo; read parts of the claim by the travel agency.Secretary general Meokgo Matuba said the ANCWL did not engage in matters of service providers with third parties.&ldquo;ANCWL like other organisations through its procurement processes procures services from many service providers for various reasons. That remains a business relationship between the client and the service provider. I&rsquo;ve taken liberty to share my engagement with you to ANCWL supporters and members,&rdquo; she said.When asked for comment, Atlantis Corporate Travel&rsquo;s receptionist said she was instructed not to give out their spokesperson&rsquo;s numbers and the company had no comment on the matter.
