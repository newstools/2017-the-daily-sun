They want to leave us poor."When they started they were zama-zamas, now they call themselves Lonmin. We do the same thing and they call us illegal."Mbangula said the government had forgotten about them and mining companies were cruel people who did not want the communities mining the abandoned mines."The thugs are the corporates who loot, take our minerals and do not even rehabilitate the land."Luckyboy Seekoei, national organiser of the zama-zamas, said they were demanding the basic right to work, and for trying to put bread on the table they were being called illegal."If we do not work, we will not survive. If we do not work, we will die," said Seekoei.Seekoei, who is from Kimberley in Northern Cape, said all miners retrenched from corporate mines were welcome to join small-scale miners in the pans of Kimberley."We have a big enough pie for everyone," he said.
