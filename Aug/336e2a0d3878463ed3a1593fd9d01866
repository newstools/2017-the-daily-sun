HUNDREDS of miners and Marikana residents are today remembered for the shooting of 34 Lonmin workers by cops five years ago.The miners were carrying knobkerries and making their way to one of the two koppies where the shooting took place.On 16 August, 2012, police shot dead 34 striking Lonmin miners, apparently in an attempt to disperse them and end their strike. Ten people, including two police officers and two Lonmin security guards, were killed in the preceding week. This was the single most lethal use of force by South African security forces against civilians since 1960.[5] The shootings have been described as a massacre in the South African media and have been compared to the Sharpeville massacre in 1960.&nbsp; The massacre took place at two locations, roughly 500 metres away from each other, with 17 people fatally wounded at each of these locations. The vast majority of those killed were killed by fire from the R5 assault rifle used by the South African Police Service (SAPS).The official figure for strikers injured during the shooting is 78.
