"Two media companies have sent lawyer’s letters. My initial stance was to meet them in court. I decided to waive that right. I am making the Lodidox shareholder register public," he said.The sale of the Guptas' media business for R450m on August 21 sparked a social media frenzy, with some criticising the deal and questioning how Manyi could afford the asking price - despite the deal being ‘vendor financed’.In effect, Manyi is indebted to the Guptas for the purchase price and has agreed to repay this over five years - without having to outlay the capital outright.There has also been concern over whether the deal was simply a tactic to convince the Bank of Baroda and other potential bankers to accept the media companies as clients, following the closure of their business accounts by several banks.However, staff at former Gupta-owned ANN7 and The New Age are reportedly upbeat following news of a takeover by former government spin doctor Mzwanele Manyi.http://www.fin24.com/Tech/Companies/manyi-reveals-hes-sole-shareholder-of-firm-that-bought-ann7-new-age-20170830I think this is arguably one of the best press briefings of 2017. Talk about shutting up your detractors live on air. #Manyi— Ayanda Unchained (@AyandaMdluli28) August 30, 2017A person who has done so much for SA, by saving jobs, by doing what not, when criticised makes me fel, wat is hppng to ppl of SA? #manyi— Zukiswa Makhathini (@ZukiswaMakhath2) August 30, 2017
