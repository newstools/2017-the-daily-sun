TALENTED artist Patrick Maphosa&rsquo;s dream is to have long dreadlocks that touch the ground.After 26 years of growing his hair, it seems like his dream will soon come true. The 42-year-old originally from Zimbabwe now lives in Greytown, in the KZN Midlands. He told Daily Sun his long dreads turn heads.He said growing his dreads has been a true test of his patience. Patrick said people often think that he is a Rastafarian.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Christian and I eat meat. I just love having dreadlocks but I&rsquo;m not a Rasta.&rdquo; Patrick has made sculptures of great leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Albert Luthuli and Oliver Tambo. He said his dreads give him strength to work every day.&ldquo;Being an artist requires patience. It takes time to become successful. That is one of the reasons I decided to grow my dreads. I needed to test my patience,&rdquo; said Patrick.He said he&rsquo;s inspired by Madiba because he fought for us to have better lives. &ldquo;His patience was tested in prison when he spent 27 long years to win the fight against apartheid.&rdquo; Patrick goes to a salon once a week to get his dreadlocks washed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been approached by several salon owners who want to buy my dreads. But they are not for sale. They represent who I am.&rdquo; He said his hair promotes African pride.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a proud African and I show my pride by growing my hair.&rdquo;
