PATRICK Chipangula (38) and Adolf Moyo (43) make their living from a shared passion for metal work. The good friends, originally from Harare in Zimbabwe, now live in Harrismith, Free State. Back in 2000, they started a partnership in their home country and then moved to Durban to carry on the business. &ldquo;We use pieces of zinc and weld it together to create sculptures the size of real rhinos and finish them with varnish,&rdquo; said Adolf.The guys said they&rsquo;ve chosen the right spot in Harrismith to sell their giant rhinos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to miss our sculptures at the busy intersection in the centre of town.&rdquo; They told Daily Sun the huge rhinos make marketing easy because they attract potential customers&rsquo; attention. They said they are confident they could sell their creations anywhere in the country, provided the market was right. Adolf said: &ldquo;It takes us at least seven days to make one big rhino.&rdquo; They said they sell baby rhinos for R7 000 each. Customers are guaranteed the creations will last and they won&rsquo;t be disappointed. &ldquo;The business is doing quite well,&rdquo; said Patrick. He urged young people to use their talents to keep poverty away.
