A BLACK Jeep involved in the murder and alleged attempted hijacking of Rhythm City actor, Dumi Masilela, has been found abandoned in Ivory Park, east of Jozi, Gauteng police said.&nbsp;But spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele said t here were no contents in the vehicle linking it to Dumi.&nbsp;This was despite it matching a description by the late actor&rsquo;s friend, who was with him at the time of his murder.&nbsp;Dumi was shot dead during an alleged attempted hijacking in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on Wednesday night.&nbsp;The black Jeep allegedly gave chase and opened fire on the actor&rsquo;s VW Golf 7.&nbsp;Said the captain: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re investigating a case of murder and attempted hijacking.&nbsp;&ldquo;Two men (including Dumi) were sitting in a white Golf 7 on Thursday when they were approached by a black Jeep, whose occupants then tried to hijack them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Makhubele said the two occupants in the Golf tried to drive off and one of them was shot in the upper body.&nbsp;&ldquo;We found that the Jeep had been hijacked in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, on the same night of Masilela&rsquo;s killing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;The owner was robbed after being hijacked by the five armed suspects. He was then abandoned in Benoni.&rdquo;&nbsp;No arrests have been made.&nbsp;Dumi, who played Sifiso Ngema on the e.tv soapie, married actress Simphiwe Ngema in a traditional wedding earlier this year.&nbsp;He was also a professional soccer player for SuperSport United and Highlands Park, but ended his career after a car&nbsp;accident. &ndash;News24&nbsp;
