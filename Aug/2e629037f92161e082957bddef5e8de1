At the Pienaarspoort level crossing in Mamelodi, protesters blocked the line with burning tyres and branches.  "It is unfortunate that trains and the railway environment is always targeted as and when protesters express their dissatisfaction on issues that have nothing to do with Metrorail services and inconvenience thousands of commuters," said metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng, Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) said the protest was illegal as drivers did not have any applications to protest.  Hi @EWNTraffic !
