THE so-called 'dagga couple', Julian Stobbs and Myrtle Clarke, will head back to the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday in a bid to have marijuana legalised. The couple believes the banned substance is not a gateway drug to other narcotics. They previously aimed to raise R1.1m to bring cannabis experts to testify during the trial. On their Indiegogo crowdfunding page, the couple said they have a list of international expert witnesses – including criminologists, sociologists, toxicologists and neuropsychopharmacologists – who are willing to come to South Africa and testify in court.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvc6GfH5m44H1MDZEwSkKnreoVRUMC5FQ-u677gqZ01vbR38UHUthp6KNvdpBFzxD7sC7e5pbJ836Qpu5_WN7uatJ_uJe4os1XaECum6jyHFYmG4CZKKl7Fik0R2Zc9sxvX_S0S0Cqh7xRTPFTZRNKsN6HTA0HfnsLD09Mz7YeHdAcwhPn5_3pjgLOAfVj5HsPzolMIF_pdyd4D7uEf_Qzy1A0rkBnaZQBENUNuMqMY7KFdNOQxZmdLxaNrrjd5CYRDb9Wa0_UOUEhkMij9zYM95OmBpHg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLJzjEQAF2LeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
