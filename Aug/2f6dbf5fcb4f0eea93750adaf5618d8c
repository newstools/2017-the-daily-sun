EVERY time they watch TV, the Mgqolozanas are reminded of how their sister died.Nondumiso Mgqolozana (41), from Protea Glen extension 13 in Soweto, was stabbed to death last Wednesday &ndash; on Women&rsquo;s Day. Speaking to the SunTeam at their home, her sisters Philiswa (29) and Sibongile (25) said the argument that led to her being killed was sparked by TV. Philiswa said: &ldquo;Her boyfriend came home drunk. &ldquo;Nondumiso was watching TV and he switched it off. She turned it back on but he put it off again and took the plug with him to the bedroom.&rdquo;Nondumiso followed him to the bedroom and asked for the plug back, which led to a fight. &ldquo;He beat her before stabbing her in the upper body with a knife. &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by this. &ldquo;How could he kill our sister over a TV?&rdquo; asked Philiswa. The sisters said Nondumiso was a pillar of strength to the family. &ldquo;She is the eldest and sent us to school,&rdquo; said Philiswa, while struggling to hold back her tears. She said when Nondumiso met her boyfriend, she had been single for a long time. &ldquo;We never liked him because he had an attitude. When we visited our sister, he wouldn&rsquo;t even greet us,&rdquo; said Philiswa. The sisters said they didn&rsquo;t want to tell Nondumiso to dump the man because she loved him, but maybe if they had spoken up, she would still be alive. Protea Glen police spokesman Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said a 31-year-old man handed himself over to the police on Sunday and will appear in court soon on a charge of murder.
