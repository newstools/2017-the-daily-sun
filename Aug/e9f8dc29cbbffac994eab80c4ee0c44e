PARENTS of Braamfischer Primary School pupils in Soweto have won their battle to be heard by education authorities.A new school will be built next year!Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi spoke to parents on Wednesday.He promised that the first brick would be laid in January next year. This was after angry parents blocked the school gates and roads, demanding that mobile classrooms be replaced with a new school. The incident happened last week when parents threatened to keep the gates locked until their grievances were heard.The parents told Daily Sun their kids had been taught in mobile classrooms for more than 10 years. Parent Lesego Ditsele (35) said: &ldquo;This was the first school in the area. We&rsquo;ve been asking for a proper school for a long time, but nothing happened. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re relieved that a new school will be built next year.&rdquo;Another parent, Lindiwe Msimango, told Daily Sun that pupils often fainted or fell in the stuffy, overcrowded mobile classrooms.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being disrespected. We want the containers gone when the school closes for the September holidays.&rdquo;Lesufi urged parents to allow pupils to go back to school. &ldquo;Contractors will be appointed in October and November to start the project to build. I commit to come and show the budget to your leaders,&rdquo; said the MEC.&ldquo;I accept all your concerns and take the blame.&rdquo;Lesufi said his department had raised R17 billion to remove all mobile schools in Gauteng. He said the new school would have computer labs, sport facilities, a hall, an admin block and a library.
