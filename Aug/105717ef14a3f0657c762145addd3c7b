DAMA Bhengu (26) is a heartbroken mum!Her two-year-old son was born with a rare heart condition and doctors &shy;cannot help him. Dama, from Lindelani kasi in KwaDukuza, north of KZN, said she learnt of her son&rsquo;s condition when he took ill last October . She had rushed her son to Stanger Hospital but due to the nature of the child&rsquo;s illness, he was transferred to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. There, Dama alleges, she was told by doctors that she must just take her son home and wait for the day he would die. However, these allegations have been refuted by the KZN Department of Health. Spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said: &ldquo;Without divulging the confidential clinical information of the patient, in keeping with the law, the department can confirm that a patient with a rare and complicated ailment has been seen by medical specialists at two of our institutions. In certain instances where surgery is considered too risky, medical professionals may opt not to proceed, in the interests of preserving a life.&rdquo;Dama believes the hospitals delayed operating on her son. She said she had learnt of her son&rsquo;s condition in October 2015, two months after she gave birth. According to Dama, doctors had promised to operate. &ldquo;But that didn&rsquo;t happen as they kept postponing for various reasons, including renovations at the hospital, shortage of beds and no doctors,&rdquo; she said.Dama said in April doctors told her they couldn&rsquo;t help her son.
