POLICE are in a catch-22 situation involving a huge national firearms investigation.If the stolen police guns are linked to shootings, they could be held liable for the crimes.Senior Western Cape policeman Major-General Jeremy Vearey, involved in the guns probe, outlines this dilemma in an affidavit.A booklet, written by one of the police's legal experts, titled Back to Basics - Towards a Safer Tomorrow, also says so.Potential for 'enormous' litigationAccording to the booklet: "The scope of the possible litigation is enormous, should the deceased have been breadwinners and were either killed or injured leading to present and future medical costs, pain, as well as a lost [sic] of income."It also highlights glaring loopholes in firearm controls in the country, including apparently poor processes involving how guns are meant to be destroyed by police.Vearey, in his affidavit, said police "ignored this sound legal advice".However, in response to several of Vearey's allegations, the police in an affidavit said they did not propose "to get drawn into a details response to operational matters which took place subsequent to the impugned decisions".It said that Vearey's "prudence in ventilating these issues in this application is seriously questioned".The national firearms investigation has uncovered, among other things, that some police officers were stealing guns from a police store and channelling the weapons to gangsters.At least 1 066 murders were carried out with stolen police guns and 216 children in the Western Cape were shot with these weapons.The investigation into gun smuggling was named Project Impi and started out as a Western Cape probe in 2013, but went on to expand to a national one involving military intelligence.It was also probing whether right wing groups were stockpiling firearms to be used against the state.It was previously headed by Vearey and Major-General Peter Jacobs.When they were suddenly transferred within the police in June 2016 - moves which they felt were unfair and politically motivated - they say the mammoth investigation was effectively derailed.On Thursday, August 3, the Cape Town Labour Court set their transfers aside.National police said on Friday that the judgment would be studied before comment on it was provided.Vearey, in an affidavit used in the matter, said police were duty bound to solve crimes committed with the stolen police guns.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/saps-could-be-liable-for-crimes-committed-with-stolen-police-guns-20170807
