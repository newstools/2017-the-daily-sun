They go on to set fire to six motor vehicles at the plant.- On 13 August, the bodies of three mine workers are found. SAPS members are attacked while escorting the protesters. Two cops are hacked to death and one seriously wounded, while three protesters are fatally wounded during the police response to the attack.- On 15 August, police and striking mineworkers try to negotiate for peace on the hill which has become the miners’ gathering point, near the mine.- On 16 August, the mineworkers gather at the hill. They have been issued with an ultimatum by Lonmin: go back to work or face dismissal. By the end of the day, cops have killed 34 miners and injured 78.- On 17 August, national police commissioner General Riah Phiyega confirms the deaths, adding that 259 miners have been arrested. Source: sahistory.org
