THE DAY was supposed to be a celebration of the life of a church member at his tombstone unveiling.But it turned into a tragedy.A packed taxi plunged over the bridge, leaving behind a trail of death.Members of the Inyoni Emhlophe Zion Church were on their way to the unveiling when the brakes of the taxi failed.It crashed over the Umsunduzi bridge at KwaXimba, in the KZN Midlands. Nineteen people died at the scene and seven were taken to nearby hospitals in a critical condition.Mzwenkosi Ngidi (40), speaking at the scene of the tragedy, said he lost two family members in the crash.&ldquo;I arrived at the scene to find my mother, Mpheni, and my sister, Jabulile lying dead under the bridge. I last saw them in high spirits in the morning when they left to take the taxi,&rdquo; he sobbed.Ngidi said if he hadn&rsquo;t got an urgent call for a stokvel meeting in the morning he would have been in the taxi too.Church leader Pastor Senzo Mncube (43) told Daily Sun the taxi had been hired to ferry church members to the ceremony.&ldquo;But we heard on the way the driver took on other passengers. There were 26 people on board.&ldquo;I confirmed that 15 of the dead and three survivors who were in hospital were from my church. I do not know the other deceased,&rdquo; he said.He said those who died were from the Ekuphumuleni, Damaseku and Samariya branches, all located at KwaXimba.&ldquo;From what I heard, the driver was driving towards the bridge when he lost control because the brakes failed. The minibus crashed into the railings and went down the embankment.&rdquo;Mncube wants the authorities to finish investigations quickly so they know the exact extent of the tragedy.KZN MEC for Transport, Mxolisi Kaunda, said after a brief inspection of the wreckage, he could see the taxi&rsquo;s brakes were not in good condition.&ldquo;We have found out that of the 19 dead, 17 were women.&rdquo; He assured families that the local government would help them with funeral arrangements.KwaXimba taxi operators said the taxi was privately owned and not a member of their association.KZN Emergency Medical services spokesman Robert McKenzie said the survivors had serious to critical injuries.&ldquo;They were taken to hospitals in Durban and Pietermaritzburg.&rdquo;
