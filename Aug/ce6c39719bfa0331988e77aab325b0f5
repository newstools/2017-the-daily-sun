SPAR Netball National team coach Elsje Jordaan says she is excited about the makeup of the team selected for the Fast5 World Series to be played in Melbourne, Australia, at the end of October.The Fast5 team was named after the SPAR National Netball Championships played in Durban last week. &nbsp;The selectors also named a youth squad and added four names to the SPAR training squad. &nbsp;These players are Tshina Mdau, Jessica Khomo, Kgomotso Ithlhabanyeng and Nobubele Phuza.Jordaan said: &ldquo;Last year, Netball South Africa (NSA) chose a young squad, to give some of our rising stars a taste of international netball.&ldquo;But we have seen that countries like England and Australia are sending their best possible teams, so this year we have opted for more experience and a better balanced squad,&rdquo; she said.&rdquo;Jordaan &nbsp;believes she had a better-balanced team than the one she had last year.&ldquo;Last year, we didn&rsquo;t have specialist goal attacks, whereas this year we have two, in Maryke Holtzhausen and Renske Stoltz. &nbsp;Maryke brings so much to the team, with all her experience and her exceptional talent. &nbsp;Renske hasn&rsquo;t been to the Fast5 World Series before, but she has international experience, and she and Phumza Maweni have been invited to play in a Fast5 tournament in England next month,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;This will be a massive benefit for us, because they will learn a lot there and will be able to pass that on to their teammates.&rdquo;&nbsp;She said she had taken too many centre court players to the Fast5 last year.SPAR Fast5 squad: Deanke Rohde (Gauteng), Maryke Holtzhausen (Free State), Renske Stoltz (Gauteng), Charmaine Baard (Western Cape0, Rome Dreyer (North West), Lauren-Lee Christians (Eastern Cape), Phumza Maweni (Western Cape), Fikile Mkhuzangwe (North West), Jessica Khomo (KwaZulu Natal), Zanne-Marie Pienaar (Gauteng) Non-travelling reserves: Talja Venter (Western Cape),Tshina Mdau (Gauteng), Shadine van der Merwe (Gauteng).
