SEVEN of South African athletes will be in action on Friday night, on Day 1 of the IAAF World Championships to be held at The Stadium, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London. &nbsp; Fittingly, the powerful trio of Luvo Manyonga, Ruswahl Samaai and Zarck Visser will get things under way when they turn out in the qualifying round at 9.30pm (SA time) in the Long Jump Men. All three athletes will go in search of a place in the final. &nbsp; On the track, Akani Simbine and Thando Roto will blast out the blocks in the heats of the 100m Men sprint, which start at 10.20pm, with the speedsters from Tshwane looking for spots in the semifinals. Victor Hogan will also compete in the preliminary round of his specialist event in the Discus Throw, lining up in Group B of the qualifiers at 10:45pm. &nbsp; The first SA athlete to compete in a final will be Stephen Mokoka, who goes in the 10 000m Men contest at 11.20pm. &nbsp; Up against a strong field led by British defending champion Mo Farah, the versatile South African distance runner will hope to put up a fight if the race turns into a tactical battle.
