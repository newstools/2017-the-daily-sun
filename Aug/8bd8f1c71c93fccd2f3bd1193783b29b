&ldquo;I HAD to watch my baby die a painful death in my arms!&rdquo; These were the words of Lindiwe Sithole, who told Daily Sun her three-week-old baby died last week due to the negligence on the part of nurses. The 25-year-old from Kagiso, Mogale City said she rushed the baby to Odirileng Maponya Clinic on Friday after waking up and realising the child was not breathing properly. She said when she arrived at the clinic, she was told the nurses were on lunch. She was made to wait for hours. &ldquo;When the nurses came back from lunch, I rushed to the reception area as my baby was getting worse. None of the nurses were willing to help and they even refused to touch my baby. They said I needed to wait in line like everyone else,&rdquo; she claimed. Lindiwe&rsquo;s cousin, Mpho Teffo, said even after other patients told the nurses to help the baby first, the nurses refused. She said after the baby died, none of the nurses would touch the little body. Lindiwe said: &ldquo;They just told me to wait until the doctors arrived later. The one side of the baby had even turned blue. We had to call the mortuary people to come and fetch the baby,&rdquo; she said. Daily Sun contacted Gauteng Health spokesman Prince Hamnca, who said they would investigate the matter. He said: &ldquo;We are going to talk to all the people involved so we can evaluate what happened. &ldquo;We will send representatives to go and talk to Lindiwe and her family.&rdquo;
