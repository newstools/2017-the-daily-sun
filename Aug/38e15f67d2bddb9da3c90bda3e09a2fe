We look forward to some exiting racing and fast times on Wednesday, 09 August.&rdquo;A popular women&rsquo;s day celebration, the Totalsports Women&rsquo;s Race encourages entrants to #RunForLife in support of PinkDrive.Christine Kalmer will be one of the runners to look out for in the Johannesburg race. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love that the race is for women only,&rdquo; said Kalmer.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to running through Johannesburg with thousands of women. You can feel the passion on event day. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s heartwarming to see how the women encourage and support each other throughout the race. I&rsquo;m looking forward to running over the Nelson Mandela Bridge, a Joburg landmark. &nbsp;My goal is to run a competitive race and a solid time. The R20 000 incentive is great and will definitely be motivation to run extra fast. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll be able to run a sub 33 min on race day though, as my personal best is 33:53.&rdquo;In Cape Town Nolene Conrad will be at the front of the field. Conrad also enjoys the fact that this is a women&rsquo;s only race.She said: &ldquo;The Totalsports Women&rsquo;s Races are well organized and the prize purse on offer is really good. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love the vibrant, energetic atmosphere of this race. &nbsp;My goal is to run a fast time. &nbsp;I am coming from Europe where I have been competing in a few track races. &nbsp;My fitness level looks good right now so I feel confident that I can go under my PB. &nbsp;It just depends on the variables that I cannot control, like the weather. &nbsp;The R20 000 incentive is absolutely awesome and I commend the race organisers for that. Instead of just winning races, we need to encourage runners to run fast.&rdquo;&nbsp;Charity Support: The Totalsports Women&rsquo;s Race proudly supports PinkDrive, a Non-Profit Company (NPC) that is committed to improving breast cancer awareness, education, and providing and offering free services to the medically uninsured across South Africa. &nbsp;PinkDrive will be present at the Totalsports Women&rsquo;s Race offering FREE clinical breast examinations and educating on the importance of self- breast examinations. &nbsp;Visit PinkDrive&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shop4Cancer&rdquo;, show support and #RunForLife.
