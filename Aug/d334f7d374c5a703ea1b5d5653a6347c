At about the same time, the mum got a call from her own mother, the girl’s gogo. The gogo told her the girl had not returned from school.The mother went to the police station to open a kidnapping case. Later that night she received another message, even more frightening than the first.“She is a fresh girl,” said the message.“Don’t involve the police or else I will kill your beautiful daughter.”By Sunday, the girl had not arrived home and, according to Sibuyi, the detectives started tracking the phone messages.“The number appeared to be somewhere close to Soweto,” he said.He said KwaThema cops drove to where the signal was leading them and the phone was detected between Freedom Park and Eldorado Park.“Police drove there with the mother and she sent an SMS message, to which there was a response.“The mother said she would deposit R200 to be collected at the Shoprite Checkers money market.”Cops went to the Shoprite supermarket close to the area where they had tracked the phone, and the mother sent the pin to the “kidnapper’s” cell number. The cops and the mother waited for about twenty minutes when the girl appeared, accompanied by a friend.Cops arrested her.She appeared in the Springs Magistrates Court on Monday for extortion.“We applaud the detectives for the great work done in solving this case. We send a stern warning to other young people to think first before they do things that will land them in trouble,” said Sibuyi.
