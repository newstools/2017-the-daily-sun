NATIONAL Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams must drop the appeal against reinstating 783 fraud and corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma and resume the case immediately, United Democratic Front (UDF) veterans demanded today. The NPA must also start prosecuting the local and international board chiefs, government officials and civilians allegedly implicated in bribery and corruption in SA, they said. The veterans' call was made in a letter they wrote to Abrahams and delivered to his Western Cape prosecutions director, Rodney de Kock, in Cape Town earlier today. "We demand that you immediately prosecute Jacob Zuma and withdraw your appeal," read the letter signed by 50 veterans of the UDF anti-apartheid movement and read to De Kock by one of the signatories, Madoda Cuphe.Parliament's suspended head of protection services Zelda Holtzman and activist Zackie Achmat were among those delivering the letter. To accept the letter for Abrahams, De Kock joined them in the NPA's boardroom, where they set out their demands.Among other things, they want immediate seizures made by the Asset Forfeiture Unit in the numerous corruption cases reported to the police.Private companies have not been let off the hook. Companies named in the letter include Tegeta, McKinsey, Trillian, MultiChoice and Swifambo."As we are unaware of any such charges or court dates, we further demand that you urgently proceed with prosecuting all government ministers, officials, board members and civilians involved in bribery, corruption or other related criminal activity," the letter says.Abrahams was given until August 14 to respond."Let him come to us," the group told De Kock.De Kock complained about being a "post office" for Abrahams, who is based in Gauteng, but agreed he would send the letter on.Fraud and corruption charges Zuma faced were withdrawn close to the time he was sworn in as president in 2009.At the time, then national director of public prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe withdrew the charges because he said there was evidence of possible political meddling in the investigation.The full bench of the North Gauteng High Court ruled in April 2016 that the decision to discontinue the prosecution of the president should be reviewed and set aside because Mpshe's decision was irrational.Zuma and the NPA are appealing against that ruling, which requires that the 783 outstanding charges against Zuma for alleged corruption be reinstated.Their appeal is expected to be heard on September 15.
