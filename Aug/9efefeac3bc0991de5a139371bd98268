MANY cheered when the High Court sitting in Middelburg, Mpumalanga on Friday handed down a harsh judgment in the so-called coffin case. Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen were found guilty of attempted murder, kidnapping and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Handing down her judgment, Judge Sheila Mphahlele said she was satisfied that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Oosthuizen and Jackson would have killed Mlotshwa if they had continued with their actions. &ldquo;I am satisfied that the state has proved beyond reasonable doubt the committing of all the offences except for count one,&rdquo; she said.In a 20-second video the men are also shown threatening to put a snake in the coffin with Mlotshwa as he struggles and squeals in terror. Throughout the video, Oosthuizen and Jackson can be heard speaking in Afrikaans and Zulu. Mphahlele&rsquo;s earlier summary of the evidence suggested that Oosthuizen and Jackson had no regrets about the incident.
