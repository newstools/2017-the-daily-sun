The robbers had come to the shopping centre to rob the Capitec ATM.“An undisclosed amount of money was taken from the ATM. The guards were rescued by the police. Members of the explosives unit were called to the scene and no one was injured,” said Maluleka.According to a witness who works at the plaza, the guards had their headphones on when the three thugs were cutting the fence to gain entry to the mall.“Had they done their job properly, they would’ve had a chance to call for back-up when the men were still cutting the fence.“They should have taken a stand. Maybe the thugs would have fled.”Resident Nthabiseng Matsekoleng said: “There was another ATM bombing last year. We have lost many shops because of crime.” Maluleka said a case of malicious damage to property has been opened but no arrests have been made yet.He urged anyone with information regarding the suspects to contact Rietgat cops on 012 432 7806.
