A MOTSWANA transgender woman is taking her country&rsquo;s government to court to demand that her ID is changed to reflect the fact she is female.Born in the body of a boy, Tshepo Ricki Kgositau (30) says that the Registrar of National Registration&rsquo;s refusal to reissue an ID indicating that she is a woman is a violation of her rights. According to The Monitor, the Gaborone High Court heard last week that this refusal &ldquo;violated her rights to dignity, privacy, freedom of expression, equal protection of the law, freedom from discrimination and freedom from inhumane and degrading treatment&rdquo;.Quoted in the story, Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO) Coordinator Caine Youngman said: &ldquo;It is a very unfair practice. Refusing to grant her request restricts her movements and generally, her whole life. I applaud her for standing for all transgender people. She is a champion.&rdquo;IDs are needed to access most government services, including hospitals.In an earlier media interview, Kgositau explains how her journey from male to female began.&ldquo;I think I must have been between five and six years old when I thought of myself as a girl who couldn&rsquo;t do the things that boys did at school but weird enough, girls were also funny towards me when I tried to play with them as if I didn&rsquo;t belong there but I grew up then with this knowledge that I apparently wasn&rsquo;t a girl yet I felt like it and didn&rsquo;t understand why I was addressed like boys,&rdquo; she said.Kgositau currently lives in Cape Town and heads up the South African-based transgender rights organisation, Gender DynamiX.
