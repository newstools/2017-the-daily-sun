IT WILL take a remarkable effort to beat Caster Semenya in the women&rsquo;s 800m right now. She is regarded as the &ldquo;undisputed queen&rdquo; &ndash; and justifiably so. She is the world champion, after all. She is simply &ldquo;unstoppable&rdquo;, according to beaten IAAF World Championships silver and bronze medallists Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi (1:55.92) and Ajee Wilson of the USA (1:56.65). Semenya reclaimed her 800m world title by setting a new South African record in front of a sell-out Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park crowd on Sunday. She ran a world leading time of 1:55.16 to surpass the 1:55.27 that was her previous personal best. The Limpopo-born superstar added South Africa&rsquo;s sixth medal to the hat, as Team SA ended the competition in an impressive third place with three gold medals, one silver and two bronze &ndash; at a championships event that saw 38 countries compete.It&rsquo;s Mzansi&rsquo;s most successful championships ever. Team SA bagged only three medals in total at the previous edition in Beijing, China, in 2015. And Semenya says she hasn&rsquo;t even started yet. She has firm plans to dominate the world. The athlete also bagged bronze in the women&rsquo;s 1 500m to walk away with two medals and more than R1 million in prize money. The top eight finishers in every event at the IAAF World Champs get rewarded for their hard work.Gold medallists get about R800 000;silver medallists get about R400 000; and bronze medallists get about R200 000. SA&rsquo;s golden boy Wayde van Niekerk, who also bagged two medals &ndash; gold in the 400m and silver in the 200m &ndash; pocketed more than R1m. After Semenya&rsquo;s historic victory, where she covered the last 200m or so in a blistering 27.8sec to zoom past race leader Niyonsaba and the in-form Wilson, she cracked a smile and did not even seem winded, having completed her London journey in style.&ldquo;Winning the world title is just a great feeling,&rdquo; she told admiring journalists. &ldquo;I still have a lot of dreams. &ldquo;My main goal was to win gold here but we still have a lot of things to achieve, like becoming a dominant force on the world stage. We have records to break and the Diamond League to win. The world record is another challenge.&rdquo; Semenya also has plans to add the 400m to her 1 500m and 800m events from next season. She added: &ldquo;This is just the beginning. I aim to make a clean sweep next year. I want to be a successful businesswoman, break world records, run my foundation &ndash; and I have to graduate! I have four modules left. &ldquo;I dedicate my victory to all the women, as this is Women&rsquo;s Month in SA.&rdquo; Semenya will compete in her last Diamond League meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, on 24 August. She said this was the easiest 800m final she had ever run: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lifetime best and the win ranks high &ndash; but it was almost too easy.&rdquo; Niyonsaba said: &ldquo;I wanted to run fast but Caster is a machine. I have to improve my training to beat her. She is looking good and unbeatable &ndash; she&rsquo;s a dominant force. Training hard is the only way to beat her. And I want to beat her.&rdquo; Wilson said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy with the bronze. Caster always runs hard, her sprint is amazing. She is the best.&rdquo;
