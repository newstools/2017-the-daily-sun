UZAIR Cassiem will start at No&thinsp;8 for the Springboks in their opening match of the Castle Lager Rugby Championship against Argentina at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth tomorrow.The Cheetahs loose forward comes into the starting lineup for only his second Test after he made his international debut against Wales in Cardiff in November 2016. Jean-Luc du Preez moves to the bench.The other change in the pack that started the third Test against France in Joburg in June sees the inclusion of experienced tight-head prop Coenie Oosthuizen in place of Ruan Dreyer. Springbok coach Allister Coetzee made only one change to the backline, with scrumhalf Ross Cronje resuming the No&thinsp;9 duties from Francois Hougaard. Hougaard and Du Preez are joined on the bench by experienced prop Trevor Nyakane and Curwin Bosch, the promising young Sharks and Junior Springbok flyhalf, who will make his Springbok debut should he run onto the field on Saturday.&ldquo;Uzair is a very versatile loose forward and the added advantage is that he is also an excellent option in the lineout,&rdquo; explained Coetzee. &ldquo;Coenie has played consistently well for the Sharks this season and performed well for us whenever he came off the bench in the French series, while Trevor has worked extremely hard and deserves his opportunity.&rdquo;Coetzee said Bosch had slotted well into the Springbok environment during his stay of almost two weeks with the squad in Port Elizabeth. The youngster also attended the pre-season training camp in April.&ldquo;Curwin is a young player with huge potential and a bright future ahead of him,&rdquo; said Coetzee. &ldquo;He showed in the very tough Vodacom Super Rugby competition that he is a skilful player and a prolific goal kicker, and he covers both fullback and flyhalf.&ldquo;He can be very proud of his inclusion in the match-day squad, as he matriculated from Grey&rsquo;s Port Elizabeth just two years ago.&rdquo;The Boks are unbeaten at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, with three wins and a draw dating back to 2011 at the venue. This will be Tendai Mtawarira 91st match for the Boks, making him the most-capped prop. He is the third most experienced Springbok forward behind Victor Matfield and John Smit.
