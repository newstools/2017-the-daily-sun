He smells a rat. In fact, he suspects there’s something between them and he doesn’t like it one bit.”A second source said Bad Boy T was turned off by the idea of Unathi cheating on him.“He’s been upset. No married man wants his woman spending too much time with another man,” said the source.“Family has been roped in to try and save their marriage, and they’re trying hard to fix it. They lead separate lives.”But a third friend said: “Unathi is gatvol with Thomas. She discovered disturbing things in his life.
