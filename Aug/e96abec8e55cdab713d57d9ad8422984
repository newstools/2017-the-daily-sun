SIERRA Leone's president says his country needs "urgent support now" for thousands of people affected by massive deadly flooding and mudslides in and around the capital Freetown.Ernest Bai Koroma fought back tears on Tuesday as he said at a news conference in the devastated hilltop community of Regent that the disaster "was overwhelming"."Entire communities have been wiped out," Koroma said at the site, where heavy rains streaming down the hill caused a landslide and engulfed homes three or four storeys high on Monday, many of them built illegally.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstEnF923c2S1oWq3un_29K7mCALm0If6Zlqy14k0ObG63TEW9dMtZMHfON786cTTb5NOQyAHhyy7mFktPq2asHhELgroTOLTkGCX_5dVmMESVNly-v8U51lEUkscKHvx8fD8P3jrBYPZp6At4_OItlKkn7Kl6-zZlb0U-TE8lXgn_l0VNkwqshnGV4m8iilgNUWU0yihBGvJ-f2K3HRluncmmREhAxDD5p4SKuaaV90tluNGpGGjyB5pwl4gbZg8oaQX_VDcXQLgpbKFfOAP_q8_H0jJr-3o3dZYA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNPTa7jxTZcyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We are racing against time, more flooding and the risk of disease to help these affected communities survive and cope with their loss."Paolo Conteh, interior minister, told Sierra Leone's state broadcaster that thousands of people remained missing.The government has promised relief to the more than 3,000 people left homeless, opening an emergency response centre in Regent and four registration centres.Abibatu Kamara, a mother of three who spent the night on her neighbours' veranda, said the government response so far had been absent."We have not received any food or blankets since the disaster occurred yesterday," she told AFP news agency.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/sierra-leone-appeals-urgent-flood-victims-170815140603721.html
