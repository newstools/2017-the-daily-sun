JOBURG Metro police and other law enforcement agencies say clamping down on brothels and human trafficking has become their top priority. On Thursday evening, the Metro police dog unit arrested two men for human trafficking and rescued four women between the ages of 20 and 30 during an operation in Randburg.After receiving a tip-off, the unit pounced on a house where two Nigerian suspects and four victims were found. One of the women is from Riverlea, Gauteng while the other three are from the Northern Cape.The women told the police they were raped and photos of them wearing nothing but underwear were taken by force. The photos were posted on a website to attract business. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: &ldquo;Girls get lured by being promised jobs, and then they are used as prostitutes and abused. We intend to shut down all the brothels in Joburg.&rdquo; The suspects are being kept at the Randburg Police Station to face prosecution.
