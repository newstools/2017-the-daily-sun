RESIDENTS of an Indian city were shocked recently when stray dogs roaming the streets suddenly started turning blue.It turns out that the cause was not some powerful magic, but untreated industrial waste being released into the air and river water.According to the Hindustan Times, a company called Ducol Organics operating near the Kasadi River in Mumbai, western India, was discharging residual dye powder into the air and river.Authorities have acted swiftly since the blue dog mystery first came to the public&rsquo;s attention on 11 August. The company was forced to stop operating yesterday.The dogs have been treated by vets, who found that the blue dye could be washed off and only one of the dogs needed to be hospitalised.But animal activists are still not happy.Animal welfare activist Arati Chauhan from Navi Mumbai Animal Protection cell, was the first to identify the problem. Quoted in the Hindustan Times, she said: &ldquo;Shutting down one industry... only results in daily wage labourers losing their bread and butter. There are many other industries in the area that pose a threat to the flora, fauna and a threat of more such cases is a possibility.&nbsp;&ldquo;There is a need for pollution monitoring of all plants and development of adequate green cover around industrial sites.&rdquo;The Kasadi River flows through a major industrial area of Mumbai, with nearly 1 000 factories operating around it.There needs to be pollution monitoring of all plants n development of edequate green cover around industrial sites https://t.co/UquVql02ec&mdash; arati chauhan (@AratiHoney) August 20, 2017
