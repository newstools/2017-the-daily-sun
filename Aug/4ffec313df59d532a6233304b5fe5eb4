A TAXI boss who survived a shooting incident said he was the target and not the cop who died during the attack.Constable Fana Cebekhulu (33) died and taxi owner Mnumzane Zakwe (54) survived when they were shot at by unknown men on Tuesday. Mnumzane, from Ulundi, said he believed he was the target. He said in a meeting with the Ulundi taxi association earlier this month, he was against the R200 monthly forced payment.&ldquo;I told them there should be an investigation because none of us knew why we had to pay the money. &ldquo;We were only told to pay R200 a month for security,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun. &ldquo;Even though we all agreed to resolve the matter, I heard there were people who weren&rsquo;t happy. I think they want to finish me off. &ldquo;This was not the first attack I have survived. &ldquo;I will stay in hiding until the situation calms down. My family is okay with it.&rdquo; He said he was sad that the constable has died. He had given Fana a lift when the incident took place. He stopped at an intersection on Princess Magogo Street and three unknown men appeared and opened fire. They fatally wounded Fana and left Mnumzane and a passerby hurt. &ldquo;They shot at me and Fana. They even shot at a person who was walking in the road. &ldquo;Those men wanted to kill me, not Fana,&rdquo; Mnumzane said.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident.&ldquo;The motive for the attack is unknown at this stage. &ldquo;A case of murder and attempted murder was opened at Ulundi Police Station but no arrest has been made,&rdquo; said Mbhele.Nhlanhla Masondo, chairman of Ulundi Taxi Association, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of a shooting incident in which a taxi owner and a cop were attacked. &ldquo;At the moment I can&rsquo;t comment further because the matter is being investigated by the cops.&rdquo;Nhlanhla didn&rsquo;t want to talk about the meeting they held earlier this month.
