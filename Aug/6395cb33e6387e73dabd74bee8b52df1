FOREX trader Jabulani &ldquo;Cashflow&rdquo; Ngcobo has allegedly been the victim of identity theft. According to the rumoured millionaire, fraudsters have been using fake social media accounts to scam the public. A concerned Cashflow said this had resulted in him receiving death threats from the victims, who demanded that he return their moola. Famous for his flashy big-spender lifestyle, Cashflow reminded the SunTeam how the court had earlier this year cleared him of the charges that had dogged him since 2011. These included fraud, theft and the contravention of banking laws allegations that were heard in the South Gauteng High Court. Said Cashflow this week: &ldquo;My handle on Instagram and Twitter is Cashflow Ngcobo. On Facebook, it&rsquo;s Jabulani Cashflow Ngcobo. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen another Cashflow Ngcobo handle on my timeline, it had 17 000 followers.&rdquo; But he insisted that account wasn&rsquo;t his, saying it was a phishing scam. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s misleading people by asking them to SMS the word &lsquo;Investment&rsquo; to a certain number. The alleged scammer demands between R1 000 and R1 500,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to know who exactly this person is because they request victims to deposit the amount via Shoprite, eWallet or Pep stores.&rdquo; But the forex trader said he couldn&rsquo;t name his suspect because he didn&rsquo;t have proof to back his claim. Cashflow said he had a legitimate business and didn&rsquo;t demand money from people, especially via social media.
