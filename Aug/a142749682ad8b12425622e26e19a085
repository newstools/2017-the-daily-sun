MEN should stop being blessers and protect all women.This is the view of Susan Shabangu, minister of women in the presidency.She was speaking at the launch of Women&rsquo;s Month in Tshwane on Tuesday at the Union Buildings.Khumbul&rsquo;ekhaya presenter and anti-rape activist Andile Gaelesiwe, and members of the #NotinMyName organisation were also at the event.Shabangu said this year marks 61 years since 20 000 women from all walks of life marched to the Union Buildings to protest against unjust pass laws that restricted their freedom of movement.&ldquo;The increasing brutality and violence against women ranks as the highest form of betrayal because the majority of it happens at the hands of those they trust: boyfriends, fathers, husbands and uncles,&rdquo; she said.She said women must move away from just being aware and take action. But more men needed to speak out and act against violence and support the #NotinMyName campaign.&ldquo;We call on all South Africans to stand up against violence, drug abuse and other social ills, not only during women&rsquo;s month but for the whole year,&rdquo; she said.Andile said women needed to be strong and stand up for themselves.&ldquo;I never thought after so many years there would still be violence against women,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to work together because a single person can&rsquo;t end the violence. We should not lose hope but keep on fighting.&rdquo;
