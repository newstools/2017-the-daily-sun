Caretaker Godisang Modise said: “Yes, the meeting with the official didn’t end well, but we never laid a hand on her. If we beat her, why didn’t she open a case with the police?”Ashley Rhodes, a child welfare official with the social development department, said the decision to fire the employees was made by the creche’s management board. “It was not a reflection of their work but their behaviour,” said Rhodes. “They attacked an official, which led to a disciplinary hearing. “All parties were informed of it but no one pitched.“They were later invited to another meeting, but they failed to arrive again. “A third meeting was held without them and the decision was made to dismiss them.”
