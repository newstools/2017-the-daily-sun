THE moment the world of athletics has been waiting for has finally arrived.&nbsp;The magnificent venue for the IAAF World Athletic Championships, the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, is ready to welcome the biggest names in the sport when the main event on the athletics calendar for 2017 officially starts on Friday night. &nbsp;Football is a religion in England but from tonight it will take a back seat, as American and Jamaican superstars join the rest of the world&rsquo;s best in town.&nbsp;Weather conditions were partly cloudy yesterday but this is the type of conditions athletes thrive under.&nbsp;Double Olympic 10&thinsp;000m and 5&thinsp;000m champion Mo Farah, who is also the local hero here, drew cheers from a jubilant crowd as he had a walkabout at the stadium known as the home of English Premiership outfit West Ham United.&nbsp;Farah and Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt will hang up their spikes after what is already regarded as the most anticipated Championships event in history.&nbsp;Shaunae Miller-Uibo, the Bahamian women&rsquo;s 400m Olympic gold medallist, was also on the track to warm up with Jamaican 2007 400m World Champs bronze medallist Novlene Williams-Mills.&nbsp;The stadium usually draws a big crowd when the popular London football club is in action, but tonight the talk will be all about athletics.&nbsp;Team America has hosted its first media conference at the stadium and the athletes, who are raring to go, promised to leave no stone unturned as they chase glory.&nbsp;But the USA&rsquo;s star-studded contingent admitted that the tide was turning, as countries such as South Africa and Botswana have announced themselves on the world stage.&nbsp; Alison Felix, the 100m and 200m sprint queen and 2012 Olympic champion, said Mzansi and Botswana were some of the countries to watch out for.&nbsp;Men&rsquo;s 100m and 200m sprint ace Christian Coleman spoke of the great deal of respect he has for Mzansi&rsquo;s Akani Simbine and Wayde van Niekerk. Coleman has ran a world-leading time of 9.82 seconds in the 100m. He and Simbine will be involved in the 100m heats tonight.&nbsp;Coleman said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a humdinger. Everyone will be tough to beat. I know about Akani, he is good too.&rdquo;&nbsp;Felix singled out the rise of SA poster boy Van Niekerk and Simbine, along with the dangerous Isaac Makwala of Botswana in the sprint department.&nbsp;While the media conference centered around the retirement of Bolt, who will retire at the end of the championships, and the injury to rising Canadian star sprinter Andre de Grasse, who pulled out of the event due to a hamstring tear, Team USA are still determined to reclaim their place as the best athletics team in the world.&nbsp;Said Felix: &ldquo;I expect to have a great World Championships and Team USA is expected to produce plenty of medals. But it won&rsquo;t be easy. South Africa, Jamaica and other countries will give us a run for our money.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasure to be here. I&rsquo;m hoping to have a strong race but the level of competition among female runners is growing. There will be a great atmosphere here.&nbsp;&ldquo;As a sprinter, I hope it doesn&rsquo;t rain! But so far the weather has been perfect, I just hope it will be like this tonight.&rdquo;&nbsp;Felix will be returning to the scene where she won the 200m Olympic gold medal in 2012.
