DANGER Khuzwayo was gunned down at Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban in 2014. Yet three years later, his younger brother Sigcino Khuzwayo from Umgababa is still living in fear. The 37-year-old said he had no peace because the feud at the hostel has ruined his life. Sigcino told Daily Sun that a year after he had buried his brother, his home was allegedly invaded by police who claimed he was hiding guns. &ldquo;They stormed into my house and demanded guns. They kicked and punched me but I managed to escape. However, my right eye was damaged in the assault,&rdquo; said Sigcino.He said he opened a case against the police but nothing came of it. &ldquo;I have not received any updates from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate.&rdquo; Sigcino said he was waiting to undergo surgery to remove his right eye.&ldquo;I will undergo an operation next month to get an artificial eye.&rdquo;He said his brother&rsquo;s killers had also started following him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had suspicious vehicles follow me around and I receive anonymous phone calls warning me my days are numbered. I didn&rsquo;t bother to open a case about the threats because I&rsquo;ve lost faith in the police. I don&rsquo;t even know what problem these hostel people had with my brother.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Sigcino should open a case so the death threats can be investigated.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said the case of assault was still being investigated.He said: &ldquo;There are some documents that we have not yet received from the crime intelligence officers.&rdquo;
