MADALA Hans Stevens (63) told Daily Sun he&rsquo;d never expected to discover bombs at a rubbish dump.The madala from Slovoville squatter camp, Joburg, said he was at a recycling centre when he discovered the two explosives, hidden in boxes of rubbish, on Sunday morning.The madala said his instincts told him not to put the two bombs together in case they exploded. His first reaction was one of shock but then he pulled himself together.He said: &ldquo;There were two big bombs and they looked rusty. My gut told me not to put them side by side.&rdquo;When the bomb disposal unit came to confiscate the bombs, they told him his instincts were right.The madala said that the community wanted to give him a reward but he refused.&ldquo;Anyone might have found them.&ldquo;I was more concerned for the safety of my people. I have lived a long life and I know I could die at any moment, but the little children still have a future.&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele confirmed that explosives were seized.He said: &ldquo;Bomb experts took them to the lab for testing. In cases like this, we call them and they handle the bombs.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t confirm what type of explosives they are, but we will have more information once the bombs return from the lab.&rdquo;
