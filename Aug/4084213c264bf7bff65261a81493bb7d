It further states that no member may represent the service on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or Youtube without official permission.The instruction says cops who use social media must respect the code of conduct of the service and consider it as the guiding principle. It says the personal use of the media implies that employees are using social media for personal interests which have nothing to do with their duties in the service.Cops are also not allowed to use social media platforms as a forum to raise any internal issues or grievances.
