Alexandra, Braamfontein and the CBD were hardest hit on Monday with roads flooding and traffic being brought to a standstill. In Booysens, more than 100 shacks were flooded and many residents were left homeless. Lumka Ndokazi (34) said she came home from hospital to find her bed floating in water. “I lost everything I worked so hard to get. The water kept coming in like waves,” she said. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi warned children and motorists to be careful. “Kids must stay away from rivers and dams and drivers should avoid flooded areas,” he said.
