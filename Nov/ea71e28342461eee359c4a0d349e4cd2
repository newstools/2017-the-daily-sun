MEMBERS of the Pinetown Taxi Owners’ Association said they have given eThekwini Municipality until Friday to clarify issues connected to GO! Durban. They earlier threatened to go on strike and march if their issues with the new transport system were not resolved.Although passengers were expecting the strike to start yesterday, taxis were operating as normal. Association chairman Bheki Mbambo said they decided to go to work after the municipality invited them to a meeting. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvSp6Sf2GSw2cpcyuWkORp13H2UKqUw4W0ZXQ4Ea67lZ05yvgXomGdgxCSISP63qMXSz2cHeq3CLJtYBCoWwC44YDau5_YQkpao6bXGYYS-MfRymkJHxoKS9kUrGthQeN_qor1Rqb_5nRuVT1zfjOBwXzXsa_8nqJ8JfXFYtHJAdptoH9RejtaABERXcDPpPpIHkI6katA4e8duz5f5Hb0PHoeKgB_AbedfZy8-Cw7jf3Fkzux5Y74RoqgMjSfzwf82dMweY4jkDP6hKvwVGPmSVM-6pGU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFK1z1tBYU7pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We need them by Friday,” he said. “If they don’t give us what we want, we will make sure passengers from Pinetown, Clermont and KwaDabeka are stranded.”Mbambo said taxi owners were not trying to prevent GO! Durban from going forward, but were afraid their business would be negatively affected.“We hear there will be a feeder system which will transport passengers to bus stops. “We want to know how this programme will operate because we want to benefit from it,” he said. “We also want to know how much money will be paid to those involved in the project. We have been asking for clarity since July without success.” Commuter Langalakhe Zondi (43) said the municipality must listen to the association because if taxi drivers march, passengers will be affected. “They must give them clarity because if the taxis strike, we won’t be able to go to work.” Spokeswoman for eThekwini Municipality, Tozi Mthethwa, had not responded to our questions at the time of going to print.
