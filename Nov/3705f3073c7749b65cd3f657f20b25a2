Landmines and wildlife do not mix.“We are proud to be able to help Zimbabwe rid itself of these mines during an incredibly important period in the nation’s history.”The landmines are a serious threat to endangered animals such as elephants and lions, as well as to local communities desperate for land to farm.Laid along the Mozambique border by the Rhodesian army, the landmines are a grim reminder of the war that killed thousands. – CAJ NEWS
