JOMO Cosmos coach, Jomo Sono, has downplayed talk of Ezenkosi being favourites to win the National First Division (NFD) title and gain automatic promotion.Since their demotion to the lower ranks three years ago, Ezenkosi have never given up hope of a return to the top flight. This season is no different – they have started off like a house on fire.Some 12 league games in, Cosmos have shown they mean business, taking up third place in the table with 21 points – two points adrift of Highlands Park, who have not lost a match since Owen Da Gama and Allan Freese took charge.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvauFeEEiGZjCeIQ52-acym2k-usjjxfWmJ785fAyQq3uFyXnfGWJFISeRnv1aCI0mG3LfOcQ-tLbX2y_X40AEA_bH22x1sFl80L9yo8hAQoFzgCTKCtp30cEjkZ8c13MoOayFbFg7dXP9hgy4UM-46CIC_up0kR0o4XnVy05YWXlr52sNsn00kMTq62kYdplaj5IzfXzvLfUlNLbJamwN9u_JxEoQ7NSV6cGm8yJAUdWqO2kuL-8bGosPMraXxa20bbmRkNHlwrGiP0LsK\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGrSNtTKR2zJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We need to keep up this performance and see what happens. Highlands and AmaTuks are the favourites.”
