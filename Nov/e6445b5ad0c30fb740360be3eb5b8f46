A SHOWDOWN is looming between thousands of retrenched Sibanye Stillwaters employees and the mine. This comes after the miners were given a month’s notice to leave the hostels. They are expected to be out by 30 November. One of the miners, Mandla Phakathi, told Daily Sun: “Cooke 1 hostel is my sweet home.

We are waiting for forced removals.” The mine’s move has sparked tension and on Monday residents from Westonaria, Bekkersdal, Simunye and Randfontein joined the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Cosatu on a march to the mine at Libanon, near Westonaria.Miners are demanding that the mine reverse its decision. “They’ve made a profit from exploiting the poor,” said Tebogo Makolwane, a member of Rand West stakeholders.Sello Rampaku, a Bekkersdal resident and chairman of Cosatu, Westonaria, said: “It’s time we owned up. We cannot let cheap labour be a game for the mine. They have retrenched 7 000 of our brothers and sisters.” Henrika Ninham, Sibanye’s investor relations manager, said on 6 November they concluded an extensive 90 day consultation with union representatives. The meetings were about restructuring following ongoing losses experienced at the Cooke and Beatrix West mining operations.
