We have accepted what happened to my brother-in-law.” Joyce said the family was in court when the suspect first appeared on Friday, but no one recognised him. “We saw the suspect. He is a complete stranger,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said when the suspect was arrested last week, he had just appeared in court in Pietermaritzburg on another murder charge. “He was linked to the attempted murder of Muzikayifani and charged,” she said. Mbhele confirmed the man appeared in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court last week. Muzikayifani and four people, including his daughter Nozipho (34), died last month when a bakkie they were travelling in was ambushed and shot at. The bakkie then crashed into a taxi transporting teachers, killing seven passengers. Some 12 people were killed in the incident. Mbhele said no arrests had been made in connection with the murder.
