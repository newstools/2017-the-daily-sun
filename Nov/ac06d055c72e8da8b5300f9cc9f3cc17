THE issue
of an increase in gun violence in Mzansi may be due to cops who fail to safe guard their state issued firearms.It has been
revealed that more than 2000 guns were stolen from the SAPS armories in the
last four years.This was revealed
by DA MP Dianne Barnard who said 602 guns were stolen between 2014 and 2015,
630 between 2015 and 16, 537 between 2016 and 2017 and 248 since the beginning
of April this year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst7zn0TBaAD3vc4rtNsoQCGObAKQOrGoYTRsc9F5-tUvxDavCy8WNTD1F7TjNKwq1PjrS2YYLcD-trZ2YNjLUzW_uHDJ1kHdc3IfPUSmIgZwriKV1C6ILoIY3idpgMI6BPsnYAWNGehkD5HLcwGuZYaJC4Pe9vvwpG1CicwWpGXjUsLdN5Exoojtctt6WxUlIa_pmGamIX86Q2Pv8aO3nGs8_7ZVH_SxLPNgUcJAVnygpdvNAFaIo3bRYMMPAy0666fHY_QE3xnKKd1oi2cw1MwVfTJruY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC1zEcecErSGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

reality is the SAPS is fuelling the illegal arms trade. Thousands of SAPS
firearms have been stolen over the past 20 years and are out there in the hands
of criminals shooting at the police, robbing and killing people.“So a
question has been raised as to how safe are we as South Africans if police can
be easily be disarmed by civilians? “And this
may be as a result that police may not be receiving the right quality training
to ensure the safety of citizens,” she said.Speaking to
Daily Sun Captain Johan Jordan said: “We have raised awareness with regards to
gun violence and raided hostels for illegal guns. We also hold meetings 
regularly to make people aware of gun violence.”
