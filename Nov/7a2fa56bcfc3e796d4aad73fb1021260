Wilson from Kamhlushwa, near Mbombela, said he gave the garage the go-ahead to clean the fuel tank.“They also changed the parts which they said were affected,” he said. “A week after I had collected the bakkie, it gave me the same problem. “I called the garage and they told me they would come and tow the bakkie and won’t charge me if it was their mistake. “They took the bakkie in and told me the same story: that the fuel tank was dirty. “Now they want me to pay the same amount of money.”Jean Coetzee, a manager at the garage, said Wilson had filled up his bakkie with dirty fuel. “He has to pay more. It’s his fault that the bakkie had the same problem again,” said Coetzee.
