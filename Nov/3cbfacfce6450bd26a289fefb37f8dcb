Mthobisi’s body was found in Umlazi Q section by his baby mama. Constance said: “Mthobisi went against my will and our culture when he started living with a woman he wasn’t married to. “I suspect he had problems in his relationship and decided to kill himself, instead of coming back home.” The baby mama, who refused to speak to the SunTeam, had apparently just come home from working night shift when she found Mthobisi’s body. Constance said: “If Mthobisi had only listened to me when I asked him not to live with that woman, he would still be alive.” Constance said Mthobisi visited her about once a month, but never mentioned that something was wrong. “We will have to perform a ritual to stop this thing from happening again, and cleanse the room he rented.” Mastandi Thabisile Mdluli said the family needed to slaughter a goat to cleanse the room. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident. An inquest docket was opened at Umlazi Police Station.
