    THE ex-Mayor
of Verulam Sagadava Naidoo says two armed men intended to kill him on his farm
earlier today at his residence in Canelands.When members
of Reaction Unit South Africa arrived at Naidoo's farmhouse they told of how he
was confronted by two suspects in a white VW Polo.It's
alleged both men then attempted to tempt Naidoo out of his house and when he
refused to exit, the suspects flaunted firearms and tried to enter his home.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssr2-2WaoqGk9qWjIxwrHNgZfjngWM2eGyJfdUZ9aZlnM60W8xCRMlZ-THdkGSWoqEtwcWDGq9oy4yLS74WG1KiA2KKavVW5loRUAA2H90JB7OzOx0zy4U7B4190LSGTRD3kbvpNfqum-nS4AT2gVXQeOSj4mffTBe9QtSFNUGumUxF38oBWz1OqaJmJlsI0GmE2rF52vUcDXOoNpERT4RXf3uY5M1Le8h68j7qNUT5p6ImrvHGdZw_3N8LwzAiQZqmcdgjuuZl2b6jtTZvtJQxdB9wy2Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF0xZVmpALfpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to Naidoo, the suspects intended to kill him as he is currently involved in a
bitter High Court battle.He has
registered a criminal case with the South African Police.The
pictures & story were used on the request of the complainant.
