Senzo was a brave man who was feared by many residents.“He was never scared to confront them on my behalf. There were a number of times where I felt my life was endangered but he would fight for me.” Mboniseni suspects that there are still people who are planning to murder him.“I’m aware that many people saw Senzo as a stumbling block. I don’t know where this will go now that he is gone.” Cyril Dlamini, speaker of the Umlalazi Municipality, confirmed that Mboniseni’s life might be in danger.“We are putting procedures in place so he’ll get protection immediately. He has been advised to gather evidence that will assist the cops,” Dlamini said.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a murder case was opened at Mtunzini Police Station for investigation.“The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage and no arrests have been made.”
