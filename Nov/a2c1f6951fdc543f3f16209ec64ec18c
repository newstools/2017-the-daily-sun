YESTERDAY, on her fourth and final day of testimony at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearing, Dr Makgabo Manamela said she tried her best to give the families closure.But former justice Dikgang Moseneke told Manamela closure comes from the truth.“I think I did my best,” said Manamela, the suspended Gauteng director of mental health.Moseneke tried to get her to take responsibility for the tragedy, acknowledge her failures and apologise to the families.He said: “Shouldn’t it be you who should acknowledge that the conditions at the Siyabadinga NGO weren’t ideal?”He said she told those who are hurting that she thought Takalani was satisfactory.“But from the evidence presented before the arbitration, it wasn’t,” said Moseneke.Manamela is one of the key witnesses to the implementation of the Marathon Project that resulted in 143 deaths of mentally ill patients.But Manamela insisted she didn’t fail in her duties, blaming various departments.Moseneke said: “You’re saying lot of things but not giving an apology.”She answered: “I thought I had apologised.”Manamela said Dirk Groenewald, the Solidarity advocate, had stirred anger in families because of his cross-examination.Some family members laughed while others interrupted her.“You killed our children and now you’re asking for protection,” said a woman in the gallery.Advocate Lilla Crouse from Legal Aid South Africa told Manamela: “Your attitude is not bringing the truth. Your attitude is not bringing closure to the families. Your attitude is not bringing healing.”In closing, Manamela said her rights were violated during the proceedings.“But I’m deeply saddened by the deaths and I sympathise with the families,” Manamela said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss6ymknedd7uptb0bNpyWHtpQ8P-4jCN7g3gQkapJyTUvQrrASdovadduObYlHCUlMVI4StVUZf3VinHJM_mciWtCBKJMssWc2tLCBOGsBM1UDH1AKrNcDyIHAg_MQecjA1jUsY0q48e_HEq8quZn-Z0We9ADwxsh__-QEHgr0AtV5ZHD6IRuaC21uxNXiFQyWfPOsODcR8P1SfGF4JWyAW2kEk26EneVXwWNcZpHk8ocmaOdp6-C3N87SXPr9nRcdcd4SsbAAJnDlU7_hFBbC8A8TbiEw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDpXBRNzKO8ZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
