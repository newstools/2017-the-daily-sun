SATURDAY night is going to be memorable for the people of Newcastle when a cappella group The Soil perform at Blackrock Casino.Fika Selepe, owner of Tauworld Events, said the performance will be The Soil’s way of thanking their fans for their love and support.He said: “The group will be thanking their fans for sticking with them through thick and thin.“The Soil have had a very successful journey and want to show gratitude to their fans for supporting them since day one.“They have promised to perform only the best hits from their albums.“They have also noted that places like Newcastle are considered small and concert organisers ignore these areas because of this.”Fika said they will book up-and-coming artist Jobie Clarke as a supporting act.“We decided to add him to the line-up because he is also a local act,” he told SunBuzz.“As organisers we want to strike a balance between booking local and national acts.“We do not want to be seen as people who do not support budding talent.”Tickets cost R200 at Computicket and R250 at the door.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuO69bDGRRhMj09pj08rRYo5BeuLNvl3hJDjQyZ-r8gWveFDlbG8GWohNSO0KlX5mNt-kJm0E_U9tHLlJIh68sVGT6R_GGzyzTkiVLrY5i15fYH97olwQYKXSdaxG_puYWln5ZygI6OuLIQcf8Y2GC3SMweybPJg3oeQ4zU32CYeQYHJhCoQTMtvIaiUnqyS7eOx4h6Ldf0r115JqdbirkTTx-ibLaSaXxBhF-f0T3lXr7GnKpQNUY_cKvEg-3DjcZzf_fBVI4wOXgB8yAN7FbiEpu1xhfy3tLoIA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLqZmVTWz04jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
