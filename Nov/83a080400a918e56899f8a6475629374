to speak-out.It has joined the growing list of nations that have strongly
condemned the inhumane act of enslaving and trading the lives of African
people.“South Africa calls for an immediate end to these atrocities

perpetrators and accomplices of these criminal acts and looks forward to a
transparent and credible investigation,” it said in a statement.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssqU6ykZedR_M6pypZ6hzb_6cmxVjKKKVHnpPyB6kO7Zt733KKEeEH7-xU9yEILM-0HGI_TmdZ870-T7XqMl8WjC2abS4eNj70dn2VdYRhl-eL4hTscOEWanoxfreBKiOJvFbHkDIqGNI6wFwj9SGSY3mHf5JEqUIQ2EI8dsxp1YVt7LhpVifFxBHJqGclMwdgID0sNw8JZFYrqz6UKcOiC-F9fRNwCnhL4KGEamQTZ0GWR9tZrnrp3hlpoggu3WDKc6enOttcZT0nH2ohQun1ljkugOsQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBFWab1WfvAQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

condemning the disturbing reports of auctioning of African migrants in Libya as
slaves. These inhumane acts are incongruent with the ideals of the
African Union and relevant African and international instruments, including the
African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.“South Africa will continue its work to eradicate human
trafficking and support international efforts to bring those who abuse
vulnerable people to justice. We will continue to champion the respect for human rights,
especially those of our fellow African brothers and sisters,” the statement
read.The news of African people being traded as slaves in Libya
rocked the world, with many believing that slavery had been abolished centuries
ago. CNN reported earlier this month that Migrants and refugees
stuck in Libya were being sold into slavery.
