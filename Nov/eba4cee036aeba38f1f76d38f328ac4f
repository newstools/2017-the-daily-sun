Whoever shot her waited for her to get out of the car before shooting her. She managed to run inside. “There was so much blood. We prayed for her to survive but it wasn’t to be. She died the minute she arrived at hospital,” said Mildrand. Unathi ran a takeaway business and was the breadwinner.“Her son tried to wake her up as she was lying in a pool of blood. Her son lost his father a couple of years ago.“He hanged himself. Now he has witnessed his mother being shot. This is very difficult for us,” Mildrand said.Unathi’s uncle, Phindile Mdoda (72), said Unathi and her ex-boyfriend were supposed to appear in court on Tuesday.“They were going to appear in court because he wouldn’t accept that Unathi had broken up with him. He abused her.“He was always following her around and would park his car near our house. “We don’t know if this was his way of cancelling the case.“We want justice. He had no right to kill her. He must rot in jail,” said Phindile.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder was being investigated in connection with the shooting.“Police attended a murder complaint at hospital.“The woman’s body had gunshot wounds to the head and upper body.No one has been arrested at this stage.”
