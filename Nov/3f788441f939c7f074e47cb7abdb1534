I asked myself, 'where am I?' He just didn't see anything wrong or he pretended he didn't see anything wrong. Of course, his signature is to giggle. And he laughed at us, we were all dismayed. You lose Johannesburg and it doesn't say anything to you?" asked Khoza.She vowed that there was no way that the ANC could self-correct.  "I mean when you have leaders who stand up and disassociate themselves from a decision that the president took of firing [former] finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas," she said."You don't have the director general, minister and deputy minister, the whole Treasury and what results do you expect?" Khoza spoke highly of late president Nelson Mandela during the gala dinner, organised by the Xubera Institute for Research and Development.She said that under Mandela's tenure as the country's president, the economy did well."South Africa also won the Rugby World Cup in 1995 and in 1996 Bafana Bafana won the African Nations Cup."We gave the world Madiba and the world cheered us up, we then decided...  'no, world you're wrong', we then gave them Zuma," she said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-laughed-when-the-anc-lost-metros-in-the-elections-makhosi-khoza-20171130
