He said their job was to protect the community. Mabalula said four people linked to the killings had been arrested and were expected to appear in court today. He said one of the suspects, strongly linked to the mass killings, was in Eastern Cape but he had been found and brought back to Cape Town. “No matter how far the criminals run, we will find them and squeeze them,” he saidMajor-General Mpumelelo Manci, the deputy police commissioner in Western Cape, said 337 arrests were made for serious crimes. Manci said besides the four arrested in connection with the 11 killings, there were other suspects arrested for other murders. New station commander General Bongani Mthakathi said they had been working closely with the City of Cape Town. Noxolo Mzugo (52) from Marikana thanked the minister and said the area had been quiet since his intervention.
