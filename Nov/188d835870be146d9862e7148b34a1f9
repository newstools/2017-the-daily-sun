Sizakele (34) said: “Bandile told us that when the boys didn’t come out of the water, he ran to tell people.“The dam is far from my home. By the time I got there, other people had already phoned the police. “They searched for a few hours before finding the bodies. Seeing my children dead was terrible.” She said the boys usually played around the village and seldom went far from home. “It was the first time that they went to that dam,” said Sizakele. “I don’t know what made them go there for a swim because the water there is deep and scary.” Sizakele told Daily Sun it would take her a very long time to get over her loss. “The twins were in grade 5 and were looking forward to going to grade 6 next year,” she said. “Qiniso didn’t go to school. I raised them by myself and now they are gone.” Sizakele is left with a 14-year-old firstborn. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Their bodies were recovered by members of the Empangeni search and rescue team.”An inquest docket was opened.
