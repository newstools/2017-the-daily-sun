I told him I wouldn’t give him a bribe. That’s when he took my driver’s licence. I went to report him the following day,” he said.Ratshibvhumo said after the cops assaulted him, they put him in their car and took him to Westenburg cop shop, where they opened a bogus case.“I spent the weekend behind bars and was released that Monday without a court appearance. Cops told me the docket went missing,” he said.Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, a Limpopo police spokesman, confirmed Ratshibvhumo had opened a case of assault but said no one has been arrested.Polokwane municipal spokesman, Tshidiso Mothapo, said their report stated Ratshibvhumo allegedly drove away from the officer while being issued with a fine, after refusing to give them his personal information.“The municipality views the allegations of assault seriously and will allow the court to determine the outcome.”
