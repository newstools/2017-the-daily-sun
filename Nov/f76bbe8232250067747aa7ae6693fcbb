Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and may his soul rest in peace.”Cebo’s colleague Oshebeng Koonyaditse said he had loved his family a lot.“He would work until late at night in Joburg but always made sure he went home to Mahikeng to be with his family,” he said.“I worked with him for 28 years and I learned a lot from him.”He will be laid to rest in his home town of Mahikeng tomorrow.
