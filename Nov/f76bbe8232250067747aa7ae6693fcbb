He was like a father to us and I enjoyed working with him.“We thank God that he gave us someone who would change people’s lives through soccer.”Cebo became a sports commentator on SABC2’s Laduma in 1998 and at the same time started presenting Mamepe a Metshameko on Motsweding FM.

Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and may his soul rest in peace.”Cebo’s colleague Oshebeng Koonyaditse said he had loved his family a lot.“He would work until late at night in Joburg but always made sure he went home to Mahikeng to be with his family,” he said.“I worked with him for 28 years and I learned a lot from him.”He will be laid to rest in his home town of Mahikeng tomorrow.
