They have never played in front of a crowd, but they are excited. I have already given them tasks to do a research about Uruguay so that they will be motivayed and dream big.”Team captain Kaylyn Jordaan said they are ready for the big challenge and they will go all out against our neighbours Botswana.“Being the team leader is a big a thing for me. We don’t know much about Botswana but our coaches told us they are a strong team, said Jordaan.Bantwana will meet either Morocco or Equatorial Guinea in the second round if they overcome Botswana. The winner of that match will then form part of three African representatives in Uruguay.
