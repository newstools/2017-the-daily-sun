    THE South African Local Government Association (Salga) says some of the measures imposed on municipalities, such as recent threats to funding or water supply, may not necessarily help the debt crisis.Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane on Monday said at least 30 municipalities would experience water cuts if they failed to pay their debt before December 8.The municipalities combined owe just under R7bn to the department's Water Trading Entity and various provincial water boards.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstMCmMRjgDuKDj_mPGac_PiVASTEy0Qqb2w1OGCpzDSiUBrEt_byJxILJsYDEwjLYD8aSuo9-NOu-1o20MoZKvXFeglfitiItm5p9nRdqpOMDyp-b3fNPjBWur1BMnt20-47uFw1KMFNxbqRQHxNoTf0wzGKj1NOIzuF87CnksdYbgp0jhDW5PFY9p_AMf4mA4q9F0nOX07H8m26fNeuDmw-zjhlPAuScBJrNmeiBRPTA_Mb5kktOSVtNFiGJf8ejsSeWVoID2zCPEB-2rgjOh2sS6rEAk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCLYQy2wSsH7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
