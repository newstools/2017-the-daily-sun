It’s the president who makes such decisions. “However, we’ll ensure Shembe gets the funeral befitting the leader that he was. He has to be sent off in a respectable manner.” Mchunu said they would work closely with the family as arrangements for the burial continue, and assist where required.“Imisebeyelanga has been an influential leader in our society. We have all lost. “The entire province is mourning. The Shembe Church has played a crucial role in building our societies,” said Mchunu.Reverend Gqinsa Mbatha, on behalf of the family, said they were honoured and comforted by the provincial leader’s visit.“Having them here to share this pain with us really gives us comfort during this difficult time.” He described Shembe as a down to earth person who treated everyone equally.“He was a very loving person who never drew lines between rich and poor. He wanted people to live in harmony. We will forever cherish the time we had with him.”
