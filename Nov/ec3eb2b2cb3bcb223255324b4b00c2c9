It’s particularly important because SARS is being challenged in many respects and we need confidence in it,” Chairperson Yunus Carrim said. “It’s in its own interests that it releases the report.”SARS is due to appear before the committee on 28 November to present its annual financial report delayed because of a dispute with the Auditor-General over the payment of bonuses.
