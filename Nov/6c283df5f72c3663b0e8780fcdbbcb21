After her husband died, Puseletso Motjeke was supposed to do a cleansing ritual.But after delaying for two months, the 54-year-old woman from Dipotomaneng kasi, near Clocolan believes her dead husband is communicating with her.The roof of her two-bedroomed home was blown away by a mysterious wind on Tuesday and she believes her ancestors are angry with her for not performing a cleansing ceremony two weeks after the funeral.The woman said: “I had a strange dream before my roof was blown away. I buried my husband in August and was supposed to do the cleansing ceremony this coming Saturday.“Now I think that my husband is angry about the ceremony. The wind was not that strong but it only blew away my roof.“No other houses were affected,” said Puseletso.“The day before the wind, I had a terrible dream. My husband was standing next to my bed and trying to say something but I woke up before he could say a word.‘I did not take it seriously but it haunted me the whole day while I was trying to work out what was he trying to say.“On Tuesday I was sitting in the house and a strong wind just popped up from nowhere.“My house roof was swept away and the walls cracked.“I believe that was the sign from my husband that I should wait a bit longer, so I am going to wait because I need to fix the house before I can do anything anyway.“I really need help to fix my house and after that I will go to my late husband’s grave to talk to him before I do anything. I am happy that I was not harmed.”Setsoto Municipality spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said, “We are not aware of the incident but I would advise the woman to meet with our disaster officer and we will try to assist her.”Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said: “The woman must get a sangoma to do the cleansing.“Her late husband was trying to warn her not to go ahead with the ceremony – or maybe he is not resting in peace.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuECIWWSGm1W8dXSUpxT2r8yoT9KhCRrhGgK12ap24K2K1vvCIyKb6qXv8Gcht9--M5JZIOKzS15Nu7zBeI1u0Cm3NlkmiUhO0cDWd7I5xpOKzYwONtkYnQghw7sn2wVmYg5OQtKbfUIy2JbfQ-ZjW3izTsmeCVQWLRSl_MZ8LR3_QSLUWawFcYK5rLAk3IJ6hWmozgrUZngO9MFKqm8S32fPns087ZnCVpIq_sia04XnUC1FbAGqES6gvte3ZrCQ4CM7Y2wx2Q0Fp1PhxedBAOP5Mir3w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJM9hnkMhcdIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
