SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini handed out gifts in Nyanga, Cape Town. She was launching the department’s festive season anti-substance and alcohol abuse campaign at Zolani Centre on Saturday.She told residents they must be careful of drug dealers because they also liked to buy Christmas presents for people.“You will never see drug dealers’ children taking drugs. They don’t even sell them. That clearly shows that they only think about destroying other people’s lives.”The campaign seeks to educate communities and promote a drug-free society by minimising the negative effects of alcohol and substance abuse on individuals and families.“Don’t take stolen things. If your child comes with anything that you know as a parent you didn’t pay for, ask questions,” she said. She warned that mothers must not claim grants for four kids if they only have two.The minister brought a range of presents.Vuyokazi Mlandeli (39) from Crossroads, whose child got a uniform, said as a single parent she was very happy.“I am not working and I was stressing about how I’m going to buy his uniform for next year but the minister just bailed me out.”Buyiswa Mbokodi (43) from Sonwabile Development Co-operation said they are happy with the sewing-machines the minister donated.“God is good all the time because we only started our business last year and now these machines have been donated. We will forever be grateful.”Early childhood establishments got gardening tools, toys and cupboards. Albinos got special cosmetics, sunglasses and hats to protect them from the sun.She also brought a big cake for the elders in the community.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst9-k6Fr1F32-NV62gu_IaTWMTNEpghVCWWxguK4AUgXPz-T0I3GCGrCzGNJ0BAENlpQYiL8oljVtKBYkF7CnztMG1Ibcc99R4nphln0NmEbklLm6BKbgYCdk4_dd-hXBk-rZVojkdUDUCYd3uL91InTyA2b6xesiPak20mT6FZjbgJ58DrwQIMBVb-DGlD42oFfvBZW4z1S1aPRcmVVhVHJP2FISFQ1SqWdpQTvZXhuzy1lMvfrOHflBEC386sTW3YN34feJkm60ncFsnOuOJttWkpCmk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOA8uOnpN7ODEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
