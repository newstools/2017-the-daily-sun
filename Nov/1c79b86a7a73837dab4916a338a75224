arresting six alleged hitmen, aged between 34 and 52, on November 28. It is
alleged that they have been operating between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal and are
involved in taxi related incidents, police killings, ATM bombings,
cash-in-transit heists, political killings, armed robbery and hijackings,"
said Mbhele. The suspects were arrested just outside
Richards Bay and were found in possession of seven unlicensed firearms and
ammunition. "Police will further interview these
criminals and their firearms will be forwarded for ballistic testing."The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial
Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa praised the police officers for the
arrests. “I would like to commend our members for
their dedication that led to the arrests of these suspects and the recovery of
seven firearms. We are confident that arrest of these men will contribute in
stemming incidents of violence across the province. We commend members of the
community who came forward and decided to work with our team to bring down
these thugs. It shows that our communities still have confidence in the police
and despise criminals,” he said.
