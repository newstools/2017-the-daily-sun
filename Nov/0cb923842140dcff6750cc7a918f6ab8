The top five most common types of bribes were to avoid a traffic offence at 39%, to obtain a driver’s licence at 18%, to secure a job at 14%, to secure a public service at 8%, and to avoid criminal charges at 7%.The institute said: “This is the first time that bribes for police matters and criminal charges are in the top five. Avoiding traffic offences has been the most common type of bribe for three years in a row.” Now in its third year, the survey was conducted with 4 962 respondents in Gauteng, KZN, Western Cape, Limpopo and Free State. It found that seven out of 10 people would change their vote if they thought their political party enabled bribery and corruption.Respondents saw the DA as the party most committed to combating corruption, followed by the EFF and ANC. The EFF’s Julius Malema and DA’s Mmusi Maimane were identified as leaders most committed to combating corruption. – FIN24
