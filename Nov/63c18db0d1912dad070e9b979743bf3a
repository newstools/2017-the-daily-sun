I’m sure they had to use a vehicle to collect the goods,” Mokhosi told Daily Sun. Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini said: “A case of business robbery has been opened at Clocolan Police Station. “Police are investigating a case of theft after computers and laptops were stolen from Cocolan High School.  “Anyone with information should visit Clocolan cops or call 08600 1011.”
