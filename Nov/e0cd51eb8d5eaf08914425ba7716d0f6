Beauty said she started having problems with her knee in 2015. She consulted a doctor at a private clinic in Witbank who suggested an operation. She said after two months, her knee started swelling and bleeding and the pain was unbearable.“I went for a second opinion and the doctor told me that the first one had made a big mistake.”Beauty said the second doctor told her he needed to replace the metal inserted in her knee with plastic.“I agreed because the pain was unbearable. It was better for a few months but then the pain came back.”Now the pain is so unbearable she cannot sleep at night. She said she has to take pills to kill the pain, but they don’t always work. “I am no longer able to walk and my knee does not bend,” she said.“I am in severe pain. The doctor told me that my veins have been damaged. “For me to get better I need the help of SunReaders to raise at least R200 000 for another operation.”
