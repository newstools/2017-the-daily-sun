To reduce alcoholism, which has been linked to domestic abuse, the Western Cape government launched the Alcohol Harms reduction initiative. The initiative seeks to ensure that shebeens adhere to liquor trading rules. “The Alcohol Harms initiative does not intend to force people to stop drinking but to ensure that they drink responsibly.” Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo and Cape Town Community Safety MEC Dan Plato handed out pamphlets to residents.Mbombo said: “Alcohol abuse is the biggest contributing factor to road accidents, rape and murder.”Some residents were elected to be community advocates and will work hand in hand with law enforcement agencies.“We want residents to take a stand in the fight against crime and alcohol abuse. “We also want tavern owners to sell alcohol responsibly,” said Mbombo.Resident Nonhlahla Dube (33) said: “We are glad the fight against women abuse is starting with government officials.”
