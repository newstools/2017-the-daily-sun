THE South African Municipal Workers’ Union has come to the defence of two izikhothane cops. The two made headlines earlier this week when photos of them using R100 notes as toothpicks went viral on social media. Following a public outcry the two Ekurhuleni Metro cops were traced and served with pre-suspension letters.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsteugd2VAGJOGeAR14i758TSUMjfFlQFDLFaIe85ldgVxq7j21NOAllJfwfpG-tcBxwwkTylkYaglshhRjorOhGi0jregIVIQTRD5R3ucvRop9QjxrJF__DXZhWbepl1OS34zV0LgVRuNiqME26-RLCQFhkK11JqT89UCbpnqPuJDJFZ3YZp6fb2xxWg9fjb6rl2d8AU9nSr9iXkRDhuAV1dOpVt8qFGSBj9-CQE95L92P3wc2723B42csZ4HxKOSem_F3Q-7VQ3w8WAqeMP4DB5UxG28Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMQBASXf-dL2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On Tuesday the union wrote to the municipal manager demanding that a scheduled pre-suspension hearing be cancelled. Union regional secretary Chris Mavhunda told Daily Sun the pre-suspension letters were served by someone claiming to be “chief of police”, but to their knowledge there was no such post in the Metro Police service. The union also expressed anger at Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, who called the cops thugs on Twitter. “We condemn Mbalula for jumping the gun and fuelling speculation that the money the officers had came from a criminal act,” said Mavhunda. “The two officers have not committed any crime.”Ekurhuleni Metro police spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said the two were served with suspension letters on Tuesday and their uniforms and appointment cards were seized. They were suspended for three months.
