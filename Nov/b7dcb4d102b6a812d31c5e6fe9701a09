    USUALLY when workers have grievances with government, a protest that draws attention to the issue is part of the plan of action.So when the Gauteng Department of Health failed to pay privately contracted security guards, they went on strike, burning tyres and barricading the entrance to Steve Biko Academic Hospital.But this was a bad move. The department slammed the guards’ disregard for human life and immediately terminated Born to Protect security company’s contract! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1523983698&t=artid%3d4f8ab51e-801f-4984-ad8f-8088db3e4b29%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1523983698&t=artid%3d4f8ab51e-801f-4984-ad8f-8088db3e4b29%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>The guards had been contracted on a month to month basis.Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa’s spokesman, Lesemang Matuka, said: “Although we respect the rights of employees to strike we should be reminded that health facilities provide essential services. We cannot tolerate lawlessness and disruption of services in these critical institutions.”Ramokgopa thanked cops for their help in bringing the situation under control. “I’m pleased the hospital management acted swiftly. A new security company has been brought on board and they’ve resumed their responsibilities,” said Ramokgopa. Jack Bloom, the DA’s Gauteng shadow health MEC, condemned the guards’ actions.He told Daily Sun he also wanted to know why the company had not been paid.“I fear there will be more disruptions as goods and services are withdrawn by other unpaid companies.” Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni stopped admitting patients last month after unpaid guards went on strike.
