PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has condemned what he calls racist behaviour displayed during last week’s #BlackMonday protest.During his annual speech at the National Council of Provinces in parliament yesterday, he said the glorification of the country’s old flag means some people still miss the days when black people were treated like outcasts.Zuma said South Africa still has a long way to go in its mission to create an equal society. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvwv3VYEOtyiumOCZRsM2EATHFwYNH3hd1wB6AHpO7QwShjQRG44IuAOwffswHmSnMXXLi_fVWADsnXyapTjnbfI6QgZdi8-4pRh4nUhHXQhHrpk41B9g54QgotqwNe9ogEct6Eqc2-ti__e5NlVSojo3whr73q-rN9z_AM5SjtenBitspuMAsOhD2f7ChhUh7pTvB-d_9yRvcpw7PGAb0eD8xbXsQEDrB2_dk5tnzNkQDFku7uwB5yvdoNANIDFNoZ4DAgrO27yzwbQx2AnpiyfC3pRtU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBhla9p0xzlOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We will continue to work hard to reverse the horrible impact of this legacy.”Zuma also complained about the fact that the income of a white household remains six times higher than that of a black household. “The department of justice is finalising legislation to outlaw hate speech and racism. There should be consequences for conduct that seeks to take us backwards.”Zuma said Oliver Tambo would have loved some of the ANC’s current policies.“Government has created a wide network of social protection services such as social grants, free and subsidised health care, free basic education for children of the poor and free basic municipal services.” DA MP Leon Magwebu said President Zuma did not have the right to claim Tambo’s legacy.He said: “As for you, honourable president, you are going to jail.”
