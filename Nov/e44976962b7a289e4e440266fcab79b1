    ORLANDO Pirates players are lazy! That is the view of legendary striker Jerry “Legs of Thunder” Sikhosana. The former deadly striker is sick and tired of the way his beloved Buccaneers are performing. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv4Ndkrh3ZD_f3U3bdWpYf8xiDxjkmHTWIrZ3R4dkPxzuXzymVxtwdesMoBa-a7YG0qLYzirVi36Kc-AIK_OAk3z6s6Z2wTD7gs-KZQftru1m8-aiTJYi1eUm3HhuoLTjGTreVMYNV-TN5EDe6JofWR0BdVsVfliZzYRHk1pfc0SB27yFR2SqdoVcHP2x087Uq1H8C3FA_XS-LtjrE4UVn1M7ovj0uMLnV_I-eTMIPWClNGW9IEo1tZzplsv8AFbn_w_6_uc2xkV_NfdjFY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM7dp-ZuV2ixEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He emphasised the fact that they are where they are in the standings merely because of luck. “They are second through luck, not hard work. After training sessions all the players want to go home. We used to stay behind and put in the work after hours. “The running part of it makes me sick. There is a lot of laziness from the players. The players only want to run when the ball is played to them.” Sikhosana believes there is no need to beef up the squad during the January transfer window. He made it clear, however, that supporters were not happy and that the players would have to double their efforts. He added: “It’s not about going into the transfer market, it’s about getting inside the players’ heads. Let them know what they need to do. Supporters are not happy.” Sikhosana claims that during Pirates’ visit to Bloemfontein at the weekend, where he travelled with Bucs’ star midfielder Bernard Morrison, they saw a boy in tears and when they approached the boy, he said that he was not happy with Pirates’ current state. Bucs defeated Bloemfontein Celtic 1-0 in their Absa Premiership encounter on Sunday and Morrison was not part of the match-day squad. Sikhosana said: “This boy had tears in his eyes. He said Pirates players were not scoring and that made the team to lose matches. He told me to tell Bernard and the other players that they must score, as the kids see them as their heroes. Bernard truly realised how big the team is when he saw that boy in tears.”
