I told her I would do an electronic fund transfer, but she refused. “We then went to the bank last month and I gave her R15 000 in cash, but I still don’t have a house.”Liziwe said she told the woman she would open a case against her, but she begged her not to go to the cops.“I paid R15 000 for nothing because I still don’t have an RDP.” Lwandile Sicwetsha, a spokesman for the Eastern Cape Human Settlements Department, said: “There’s a legal way to sell an RDP. It can only happen after eight years, and the RDP must be sold back to human settlements. Resident must report any illegal sale to the cops.” Samkelo Ngwenya, a spokesman for the municipality, said: “As the municipality, we are not aware of any sale of RDPs. We went through the documents that were received and found that both signatures were fraudulent. “The municipality encourages Liziwe to open a fraud case against the alleged perpetrator. We are also investigating the matter.” A case has still not been opened at the cop shop.
