Celtic will start as favourites.But Hunt is not worried about the favourites tag. \He has been plagued by injuries and suspensions since the start of the new campaign, but on Saturday Hunt will have his pick of an injury-free, suspension-free squad.He said: “I’ve got a big call to make on my final selection now that all the players are back.”One of the main reasons Wits go into the final in a confident mood is the return of both experienced central defenders, skipper Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo and Buhle Mkhwanazi. The two played together for the first time in the 0-0 away league draw away to Maritzburg United last weekend.Mkhwanazi returned after a seven-month lay-off to help Wits beat Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 in the semifinals while Hlatshwayo, also the Bafana Bafana skipper, was injured earlier this month training with the national team. Said Mkhwanazi: “It was great having Tyson back. We understand each other so well and form a really good partnership.”He also stressed the importance of the two centre backs in helping Wits win the championship last season.Explained Mkhwanazi: “Not only are we solid at the back but we score goals too. Tyson scored six goals and I got five, and those 11 goals went a long way in helping us win the league. Hopefully we will get a chance at set-pieces on Saturday.”Midfielder Vincent Pule is another player who has performed well in the midst of Wits’ battles this season.Said Pule: “We owe it to ourselves to win the final. I’m happy that I’m getting more game-time this season, it shows the coach has belief in me and that has boosted my confidence. “I’m looking forward to contributing in the final.”
