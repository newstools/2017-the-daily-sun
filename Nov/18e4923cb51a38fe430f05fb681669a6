FOR three terrifying days, the family searched for their son without success.The boy’s 35-year-old dad said his horror started on Tuesday when he received a call from his wife (32), saying their five-year-old son had been taken from his creche in Winterveld, Tshwane by unknown men.“My wife was crying and I was heartbroken,” he said.A few hours later the family started receiving calls from a man who demanded R70 000 ransom.“Workers at the creche said a man they didn’t know fetched my son,” said the dad.“We searched everywhere and eventually called the police.”But the kidnappers kept threatening to kill the boy. On Thursday, the dad decided to got to a sangoma.“The sangoma gave me muthi to drink and showed me a picture of my son on the wall. He looked at me. I was shocked to see my son was with a family member.”But the family member told the dad he knew nothing about the kidnapping.“He denied any involvement and the ransom calls kept coming,” said the dad.The nightmare ended on Friday when the boy was returned to his family unharmed.“Police told me the kidnappers took my son to a salon and left him there.“I want the kidnappers to be arrested. My son told me they hit him on his head with the butt of a gun. The also hit him with a belt on his thighs.”Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of kidnapping was opened.“Cops are investigating, but no arrest has been made.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuvU6TYZBg_xdVDpl7CSbu4T8YRqHXwSVWdP5IuFhBD_F0-TcQswCmW08W2XkdXZyMpbd9jThxQdAdasKmeKcDPtgt_1ozFl42AMWVpADGYz3ZfQFV4LprIG9ey3n0p80B_VI09qXVP6OXp3Dgx6G90uDH-4uDmcl_FbizLEWYxNwbeENB9Zwh5iuA7VEuPwlAGNT1qmCv8SF7JRBi2xAOzTXSStO_jDK1U5ZZZfQV3JUCmUT47XNs7U62N3cN_UzBsByv-cfepM3G99Za6FfEZW3Z8Mhg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNZl0drVABZjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
