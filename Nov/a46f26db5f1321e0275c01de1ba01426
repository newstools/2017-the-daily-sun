The only thing I leave behind is my braai stand so I didn’t lose anything in the fire. I saw a guy, who is a known drug addict, running away. I think he’s the one who started the fire,” said Takara.A homeless man who sleeps at the station said he knew the person behind the fire. “I will tell the vendors who burnt their goods because I know him. He is bitter because he wanted to sleep here and get paid for looking after their goods,” said Dawood Bailey.Vendor Thumeka Mlalazi (33) said: “I’ve lost all my stock. I had sweets, biscuits, peanuts and chips worth about R500. Now I won’t have any money left for rent.” She said she paid R250 for rent. “Now I’m forced to borrow money to pay rent and restart my business. Whoever did this must pay.”Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said: “The fire didn’t affect operations. The cause and damage will be investigated.”Cape Town Fire and Rescue Services spokesman Theo Layne said: “A container used by vendors caught alight. No injuries were reported. “The cause is undetermined.”
