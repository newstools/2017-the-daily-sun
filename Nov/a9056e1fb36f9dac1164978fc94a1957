You will only see me in spirit,” said the letter that Malika Sekhoto (50) from Sharpeville, Vaal left her daughters on Tuesday.“Stay well, my children. I am gone. I suffered for a long time raising you. I’m giving you life so you can live freely,” said the letter written in Sotho.Malika’s worried daughters are pleading with their mother not to end her life and come home.Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, daughters Relebohile (20) and Thelma Sekhoto (24) said they haven’t seen their mum since she left home two days ago.In her letter, Malika says it’s sad to struggle to raise kids and never get any love or appreciation.The young women said they suspect their mother left home because of an argument between Malika and Thelma. Malika’s letter refers to the pain she felt when her daughter argued with her.“My mother had a fight with my sister. We left the house to go and find help from relatives but when we came back she was gone,” said Relebohile.“We are not a perfect family but she didn’t have to leave like that.”Thelma said: “We fought when I asked her for permission to go and see my boyfriend. I told her I would go despite her saying I couldn’t.” Thelma said they are pleading with their mother to come home.“I’m sorry I led you to this. We love you. We beg you, don’t kill yourself and come home,” she said.The sisters claim when they asked for help from the cops, they were told to tell their story to the media.
