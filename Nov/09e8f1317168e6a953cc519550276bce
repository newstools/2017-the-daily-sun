Margaret Ngwenya (58) said the broken pipe has caused problems for years. “The city keeps fixing it but two weeks later, it bursts again. There isn’t a month that goes by without sewage flowing into our houses.” Bongani Mokwena (24) said the broken pipe made it difficult to enjoy life. “I have no friends. Everyone has run away because they can’t visit me in my room, which smells like hell,” he said.Thoko Mabika (37), who sells fruit and vegetables on the street, said she has lost most of her business. “I tried talking to the councillor to fix this mess but nothing works.” Councillor Tefo Raphadu confirmed that people on the street have complained about a broken pipe. “I have been in touch with the city and a promise was made to fix it,” he said.
