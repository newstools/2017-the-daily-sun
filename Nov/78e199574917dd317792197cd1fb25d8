He said he has regular customers and some come from as far as Mitchells Plain and the Strand. “They like the way I brew my mageu because it’s natural and tastes very good. “Since the day I came here to Makhaza, business has not disappointed. It’s clear I was wasting my time in Site B.”He said he sometimes runs out of mageu but his wife helps him keep up with the high demand. “When I’m selling my wife prepares more mageu. “Sometimes people buy my mageu to cure their babalas.” He said he wants to grow his business so he can operate in various kasis in Cape Town.
