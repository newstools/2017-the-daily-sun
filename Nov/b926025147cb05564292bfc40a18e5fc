    The ANC wants to vote to remove Herman Mashaba as Mayor of Joburg.But their reasons for wanting to remove him have nothing to do with any failure on his part to do his job, said the DA. In truth, it is the way in which he has started scrubbing this city administration clean that has got them so upset.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1976449005&t=artid%3dbb925392-bf32-4649-a34b-608c99b836b6%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1976449005&t=artid%3dbb925392-bf32-4649-a34b-608c99b836b6%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>The DA says the ANC wants Mashaba out because the mayor has declared war on the "ANC’s legacy of corruption and looting" that brought Johannesburg to the brink of bankruptcy.DA leader Mmusi Maimane addressed hundreds of DA supporters on Thursday about the Vote of No Confidence against Joburg Mayor Mashaba.The DA believes Herman Mashaba’s campaign to weed out dirty officials in the city is a disaster for the thousands of cadres who relied on the massive web of patronage and corruption."He has shone the light on the entire crime syndicate that had been masquerading as a metro government here, and they are desperate to make him go away. We will not let them win."On Thursday, DA supporters, led by Mmusi Maimane and top DA Joburg officials, marching from Parktown, Joburg, to the Joburg council in Braamfontein.Addressing the crowd, Maimane hailed Mashaba as a hero of the poor.“Mayor Mashaba’s government inherited a city with a 10-year, R170 billion infrastructure backlog. “The task of working through this backlog through infrastructure investment, maintenance and repair is huge.“But instead of giving up, Mayor Mashaba started tackling it head-on. And one year later his list of successes is truly impressive,” he said in his speech.“A massive R12.8 billion has been budgeted over the next financial year to upgrade infrastructure, build new infrastructure and repair existing infrastructure.“R105 million has been set aside to install and repair traffic signals across the city, and a R79 million has been allocated to repair potholes.”He slammed the ANC and former Mayor Parks Tau for corrupt conduct.“When Herman Mashaba wakes up in the morning, he thinks about what he can do to make the city better.“But when Parks Tau wakes up, the first thing he thinks about is: ‘Where can we steal today?’”Mashaba is not the only one in deep waters, as Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor is also facing a vote of no confidence.
