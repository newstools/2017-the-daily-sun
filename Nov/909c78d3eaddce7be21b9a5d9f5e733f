TWO people were burnt to death in Colchester on Sunday morning when their shack caught fire.Nonganina Mbengashe (79) and her son Zwelandile (46) were in their one-roomed shack in Endlovini squatter camp, near Nelson Mandela Bay kasi, when the flames ate them.Neighbour Thenjiwe Ngxande (40) told Daily Sun: “My husband woke up thinking it was raining outside. But then I saw huge flames and plumes of smoke.“I screamed and started running to get buckets of water. All the people in the squatter camp woke up.“Nonganina and her son were screaming helplessly. They were bashing the walls of their shack for help but the flames were too strong for us. We had very little water, and by the time the firefighters arrived, it was too late. It was traumatic.”Another neighbour, Nomvuyo Kweta (53), said because the shacks in the area were too close to each other, everyone was scared the fire would spread.“We use solar power for lighting and paraffin stoves for cooking. We don’t have electricity and there is only one communal tap,” she said.“No one really knows what caused the fire. We are suffering here and no one from government is helping us.”Community leader Godfrey Jacobs said the government needed to build houses for residents.“The shacks are small and people are overcrowded on this tiny piece of land.”Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed the deaths.“It’s suspected that the son was busy making food when the fire started.“An inquest docket was opened at Kinkelbos Police Station.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvaqAR0JviWeB6KCwtXJdBS47kQdRh25_FidZrzPKzVdzabbCch4zcjUi1L2DQGiVygzy33VU3sTWznD-TsSZAzieGHvry8Zc3NUF3nCHMrfakJyD64NyZe2WF7pHUB0Y_oyD4s0W0w9jQP63Qfc1jLUDtJhWXHEiDvOeqPu6Jyn9w-WorEVUq8tpFvbwv8e2LawejKIpCaEP14-mPWGOKQ9q5I7BCEJqaGhFVgRbV8lh0hND7gVaJ-vLknVIu4JPt39I3-hkMaMyf72AEAIhpLtwyNVb0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHztXn7k76vSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
