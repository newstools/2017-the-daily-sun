He has named his 229km journey the Jozi 2 Wollies walk.The walk is to support the Lebaleng Bursary Fund, a non-profit company that empowers matric pupils. Ramotseki, the fund’s founding director, said: “The aim of this walk is to gather support for the fund through fund-raising and sponsorships. “I want to create awareness in the community, not just about this cause, but about the organisation as well.“We hope to reach a large audience and inspire the youth to take their education seriously.“The organisation wants to make learning fashionable.”Ramotseki described the fund as a vehicle for social change. He said they contribute to the development of young people by giving bursaries to disadvantaged, academically deserving youngsters who want to study at universities or colleges.His journey will start on the N12 highway in Soweto, where Ramotseki will make his way to Carletonville. On day two he will walk from Carletonville to Potchefstroom before travelling to Klerksdorp on the third day.Day four will see Ramotseki walking from Klerksdorp to Bona Bona Game Lodge before he reaches Wolmaransstad.All he needs for his walk is accommodation, food, energy drinks and water.
