I noticed old people in our street no longer are themselves. I think they’re afraid they might be next.” Gogo Mahlomola Lerumo (78) said she was not scared.“I believe if it is your time, you cannot run away from death. The three women were very good people but God has called them.” Sangoma Makgonatjohle Seaparo said: “It is hard for a witch to kill three unrelated neighbours with different ancestors. “Maybe they were close. Each death affected them.”
