The police need to argue either that there is no discrimination or that the discrimination is fair.Thabo Gumede from the Coalition said: “In our community, statistics show crime is very high but when you go to the police station you realise that they are under-resourced to the extent that only one van is available. “Sometimes people are told that there are no vans.” Gumede said the sad part is that rich areas have many resources although they don’t have a lot of crime.Fadia Peterson (40) of Hanover Park said: “We have suffered at the hands of thugs but our government is doing nothing about it. Gangsters have taken over everything, including schools. We hope the court will decide in the interests of the people.”Nompumelelo Mlandu (56) of Nyanga said: “My son died in a robbery years ago but police haven’t found the killers. I believe that if they had enough resources the case would have been solved.”
