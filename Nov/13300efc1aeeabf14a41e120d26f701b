CHAOS erupted when 15 people accused of buying jobs from their councillor were removed from work by community members. Residents of Polokwane extension 78 in Limpopo claimed the workers were stealing jobs from the poor as they had money to pay councillor Tebogo Mojapelo for jobs on the Extended Public Works Programme. The incident happened just three days after the councillor was released on R1 000 bail. She spent a week in jail after being arrested by the Hawks for allegedly soliciting bribes from job seekers. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu1Zxy5Q_4cWlBDqjeyy2wh9QDKrWC4f5NxDnBdRhsBOB_PcZZZig6knL0CJVEBt4QYixuvQG498Z3pZqNf_dHldutLLs0bE1tyzYy8NaGhLytPoR_eoe1kVNhvTzYDSLOkORWPkzseBIRUyvcPUNHYVGg-qbIDsBHGT-jS_0KiyF5G0njC2bVlzcPuPjpiEn90fLgk0UwQQDdvhYNXrvzUrSUZuqAZQWLcoHuspYB8q0VvihU0bLpnSoPEB7GD4GuOm62ex_JNkmdLA54lt9z1yzWz-eg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEqlBEHMnThAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Maggie Thaba of the project steering committee said they wanted people hired at a community meeting to continue working.After a long discussion with community leaders and the Westenburg police, the councillor agreed to remove the people she had hired, but said: “You can say what you want about my arrest, but you should know that I am innocent until proved guilty.”
