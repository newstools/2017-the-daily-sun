THE Free State High Court in Bloemfontein put the brakes on the ANC’s provincial elective conference and declared the disputed branch general meetings unlawful. The court also ordered a re-run of the disputed branch meetings before the provincial conference can be held. The conference was meant to take place in Parys over the weekend, with provincial chairman Ace Magashule going up against his deputy Thabo Manyoni for chairmanship. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKc0kZeoXwSOyUv6dwwqS6sDgAdBppHVaFx1D6NxFh2IduT3SCVxBMGflLWZNBQFyfYwxtSfjRJ2HUIRxl0b7U_0kFU8TLzMIh2-wNakTARcKbRkgOsbm7YfmDiAxUNIiIByr-GEQ3J-Jmii5ubTIfU3G9mCEeQC_JLMheMx-xGHIew61Zsimd4gFv_zQ7nwXY4bsTIDYZ5sLhjxE_AIHXZA2fTr4J7IKcML6V5_QHtRkGCXv62yJ7T4wxPQU5OZg0td3lyI6Tad0WFeB5VPPJO4g7bDQ\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YR4jdnJL0iRBjq5epsTEpvajxGWPTKshUfX2uIaabFRF9uLVabPPMiBjgmoReTV1MkdjGgvuGLq0uTRGkAZpjgQb3zmJKjhs1JJJ4WSWg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA_xf0psH-_CEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This was despite the fact that Manyoni, who leads the faction that supports deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa, boycotted the council. Provincial ANC spokesman Thabo Meeko yesterday said the leadership would study the court judgment before deciding on the way forward. He described the court action as part of an effort to destabilise the province before the national elective conference. However, one of the members who took the party to court saidover 80 branches had branch meetings to nominate delegates to the provincial conference without following the ANC constitution. The member claimed provincial executive committee members were bullying regional executive committee members into holding branch meetings even when they didn’t have the required number of members present.
