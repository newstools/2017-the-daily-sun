THE race between two fast cars on Sunday night ended in disaster.It appears the drivers bet on a race from Bedworth Park to Sharpeville in the Vaal, south of Joburg.But shortly after the race started, residents heard screeching tyres and loud bangs as a BMW M4 convertible crashed into a house.The four kids sitting in the lounge got the fright of their lives when they heard the loud crash and saw a wall collapse as the car crashed into their bedroom.A bystander, Joseph Tlabanelo (34), said he was coming back from the garage when he heard two cars approaching at high speed.“It was like a movie. The cars flashed past me at great speed.“Then I saw the BMW lose control when it failed to make a right turn.“Then the walls of the house facing the street came tumbling down as the car landed in the bedroom.”Thabiso Nkhasi (27), who lives in the house, said they often heard cars racing past their house over weekends.“Luckily nothing happened to the kids as they were sitting on a couch away from the walls of the bedroom.”Thabiso said he had gone to the kitchen to make tea when he heard the walls collapsing and wardrobes falling.“I was shocked when I saw a car in the house.“It’s just luck that the kids were not sitting near the wall.”Police spokesman Captain Attie Leoate said a case of malicious damage to property has been opened.“No suspects have been arrested yet.“The driver has been admitted to hospital after sustaining injuries to the head.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssbUg-DrnPix2Ho1RlxDu59ApD1LF-f_m5LWKHk6BNXX4uzINgr45ic48mOXk19eK2qjfjZTxUxoHZiWku67vhp11es9bjCgSyZy0ToCt7MuzGTRTZRgkWOES8ES6I90035dZkFrR_u1mcSSP0i6E8P95JsrJ3VnGrGRX4mtViFMeQu7suSqI7hCpc-rLSeaek0VuSjK-EDHEP85dSTmC7XxIDOQSXSd6eqZ9dnKLDCw4qLB0i2Twh68ltXrnRTDo-tp-Kta6i6cEPz_jvdxh-7EhbIZQA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJNWFhn1-sNEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
