WHEN Jabulani Mtyali went for four months without poking his girlfriend, she called him a “slap tiger”.  The 41-year-old from Queenstown in Eastern Cape then decided to travel to Port Elizabeth to get tablets to strengthen his erection, but they backfired: his 4-5 has been stiff for a week! Jabulani said his girlfriend of two years left him on Friday because the tablets made him want to poke her all the time, and by yesterday his erection had lasted for six painful days. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdjmLrK-tXpnvmLZL952kXgOt4B0lf-aEVVAkxBznBZoLld9jv05yhel7cXMDyR6cXk0UsSlK0MABcHHzlLt2BcnZsEg3LQe7sio62XaRe-qwLDJerr1ZQqnmhYhIjOvD6vTNsFXS2qoYuIB1af2X2709-mjHarr67UHUNchQIXpNb7FRHIWhX1cfdyzbukwNwEav9neOX4F_bCF6SwRi6fhA3HD6VID2apaoejPTO6C-PqaqDaonf1VntzSYviwxHMkgw1N9XFFYmsC22Gf8AEQXvpPw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKzm2Em214pVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My 23-year-old girlfriend complained my 4-5 was no longer the same.“A friend of mine took me to Korsten marketplace and I bought two packets of tablets for R60 each.”He got back home last Thursday and took two tablets. “My 4-5 became very strong and my girlfriend enjoyed it. But things got ugly when it refused to go back to sleep. It went on all night and my girlfriend started bleeding,” he said. Jabulani said his 4-5 was painful and doctors told him he would have to pay R15 000 for an operation. “I do not have the money, so my mum is selling two cows to pay for it,” he said. A doctor from Port Elizabeth said Jabulani needed to be treated immediately as it was dangerous to have an erection for more than four days. “The problem is, blood is building up in his penis and it could kill him,” he said. Jabulani’s girlfriend said she loved him but she could no live with his erection.
