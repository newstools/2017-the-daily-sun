    THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) has distanced itself from the decision to take the Telkom Knockout final to the smaller Princess Magogo Stadium, insisting the sponsors had the final say. Saturday will see Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic battle it out in the Knockout final at the 12 000-seater stadium in KwaMashu at 6pm.Explaining the rationale behind taking the final to the KwaMashu venue, PSL CEO Mato Madlala said the last four teams – Kaizer Chiefs, Wits, Celtic and Polokwane City – were consulted before the final decision was taken on where the final should be played. It is a league rule to play the final at a neutral venue.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuYCur09GWU6KUhvgyAcE4vScbTU0ctrM_d2k8I2alqnWNIO_waMaqhMNXVxM6HGhIBXqDf-d0RkpGLmDQ_1yjiqqD4SbrsIM-ybCyPgLiXANkByAOugFYX7xQtZcL3FAza81ACYT8kCcF-71MVoSIkAhPOIFR0_OFr3EgKnBaBGVx6FmtgzfEESXSGmdUIekMxA-eM-xqnfXIZGlDimOn8r1k57mGQ9auGb7p6YvtspphVIT3XWp2PeOwbJlNCK07B452jKH68T6THI66r\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHVjMoLcFYGYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said: “People must understand that the league has nothing to do with deciding where the final goes. Our sponsors come to us and request venues. They tell us where they want to go and we have to respect their decisions. “We also involve the teams in the semifinals and make them aware of the sponsors’ requests. In this case the sponsors came to us and said they wanted the final to go to Durban. They gave us two stadiums to choose from. We had Princess Magogo and King Zwelithini Stadium. “We consulted the teams and they all agreed on Princess Magogo. The sponsors (Telkom) said they wanted to take the final to the township and KwaMashu is the venue.”There has been an outcry from other provinces. They say the PSL takes all cup finals to Durban, seemingly implying that no other provinces have suitable stadiums.The sponsors’ chief marketing officer, Cambridge Mokanyane, said they were delighted by the prospect of taking this cup final to KwaMashu for the first time.Said Mokanyane: “We have consistently taken matches to the people. We’ve been to Sisa Dukashe in East London, Polokwane, Gauteng and now Durban. The last two finals were held in Polokwane and at Mbombela Stadium in Mpumalanga. “We didn’t hesitate about taking this final to Durban. Durban is good for us. Durban always turns out. People in Durban love football and people from inland also go down there.”Wits defender Bongani Khumalo and Celtic’s midfielder Jacky Motshegwa said they were happy and comfortable to fight this one out at Princess Magogo Stadium. They say they like playing in front of a good crowd and what better way to ensure that than playing the final ekasi.
