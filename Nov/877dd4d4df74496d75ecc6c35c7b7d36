process by 15 December.“We do hope that the Class of 2017 will bring us some good
news at the start of the New Year,” said Mweli.However, the National Senior Certificate (NSC) results will
be announced by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, on 4 January 2018.He said, this year the department placed increased emphasis
on security and the protection of the integrity of the NSC examinations.This was done to mitigate the impact of likely risks
associated with the storage and movement of examination scripts.
