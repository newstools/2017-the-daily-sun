She said the victims expressed their wish for Manana not to be sent to jail. She said they wanted Manana to pay each of them R100 000 for trauma and humiliation.Smith said a suspended sentence was not an option since Manana was a repeat offender.She said the offence was serious and the public expected the court to give a fitting sentence.
