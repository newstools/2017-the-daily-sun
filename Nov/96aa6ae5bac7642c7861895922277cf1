At first I didn’t think about it but I became suspicious of the cotton wool.“I smeared myself with muthi to protect myself against possible curses, but as time went on the wound started getting irritating and later became painful.”He said he went to see sangomas who told him he had been tricked with the banana.“The sangomas told me to carry on using the muthi, but later my leg had to be amputated at Leratong Hospital in Krugersdorp.”Thabang used to help men with muthi for their sleeping 4-5s. He also helped the needy.But since the incident, he has had to pack his bones away because they’ve dried up. He said he also had to throw away the muthi he used to help the sick.“I’m lucky to be alive but I can’t operate my business anymore,” said Pitso.“I survive on a disability grant now.”
