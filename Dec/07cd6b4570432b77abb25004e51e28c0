I’ll never be able to enjoy it again,” he said.He said the unoccupied shack used to belong to his uncle, who was bust three months ago. “The door opens easily and the kids used to go in and play. “They were playing hide and seek last Thursday and Kefiloe hid behind a mirror. That’s where she got electrocuted.“There used to be a plug behind the mirror, but it was removed. The wires were exposed.” Thandanani said Lerato had gone to buy him cake. “We were preparing to celebrate my birthday when my son came running and told me Kefiloe had been electrocuted.” He said they rushed her to the clinic but she died on the way.Devastated Lerato (29) said they had already bought their daughter Christmas clothes.“Now she won’t get to wear them. My heart is sore,” she said.Lerato told Daily Sun they aren’tworking and don’t know how they will bury their child.“We need all the help we can get,” she said.“We would like to bury her on my birthday on Friday.”Sergeant Vincent Mashiteng said a docket has been opened and police are investigating.
