    AN UNEMPLOYED father who was broke and too proud to ask
for help pleaded guilty to murdering his 6-year-old daughter.According to New
Zealand Herald, in September 2015 Stephen Phillip Playford (55) from
Brisbane in Australia came up with a desperate solution to being unable to
support his family: murder them and then kill himself. Playford prepared by stocking up on nitrogen gas tanks.

did next. He took his sleeping daughter from her bed, put a gas mask on her
face, and turned on the nitrogen gas cylinder.But for some reason the gas didn’t work fast enough, so
he smothered her face with a pillow. When the life had finally passed from her
body, he returned her corpse to her bed.He had apparently also been planning to kill his wife,
but her screams when she discovered her daughter’s lifeless body made him flee
the house.Playford then drove to the Gold Coast hinterland where he
tried to commit suicide. A passerby found him and called for help, so he
survived.He eventually confessed his murderous deed to the cops.Handing down his life sentence on Tuesday, Justice David
Boddice said Playford had committed the "most unimaginable criminal
conduct".
