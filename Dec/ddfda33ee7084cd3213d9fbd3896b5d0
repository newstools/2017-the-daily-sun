    “I KNOW Mamelodi Sundowns. We start slowly every year, we never take the lead. Hopefully this time, we can take the lead.” This is how Pitso Mosimane described the race for the league title a month ago.“Baroka FC are doing well. But you always see the big boys coming up as the season goes on. You know the story, especially when the schedule gets tighter with more games in quick succession,” he continued.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstCassiXyAd8DgWES7cg71vm4KnRpg4vhd303r48QW_g1LjQqTcJmDjCzMBoUPRzdtM4fR8BbbAHU9SAkz9DHNz6FtaXqTGvl32GZv-63GuBKFEtFxgvSUgC6-bHsTSf_dTDAUhisX02f7qDoaKGxznzBCC7kWxmQe0eE8xqGC515BsUwBPqpTVtB0Vgs31_bdsgexMS4-tgJdIKiOmc8WEwFQFq3aMXteJB3bDMnV7QUTxiNHViINMSKZfxeRf3uRjXxlhOcvfmRAAkR6q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBHW03uUuAcOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You’ll start seeing things shape up differently.”Indeed, things are starting to shape up differently for the Brazilians, who moved from mid-table right to the top of the Absa Premiership with a 4-0 victory over Baroka on Tuesday.It’s fairly early days, premature for the Brazilians to even start thinking of popping the champagne, as they only lead on goal difference.But it’s not easy knocking the Brazilians off their perch at the top once they hit top form.In a show of force, Mosimane’s men pummelled Bakgaga at Atteridgeville’s Lucal Moripe Stadium on Tuesday to send a strong warning to opposition teams and make their title aspirations clear.Despite their success on the continent, the Tshwane giants had nothing to show for their efforts at home last season. Their sluggish start to the season has already accounted for their early exits from the MTN8 and Telkom Knockout.They hadn’t looked convincing until their last three matches and have collected 19 points out of a possible 30 so far.“We played well against Baroka. We started well. I think it’s the third game where we scored in the first three minutes, which is good. It helps our confidence,” Mosimane said.“When you score goals, the confidence returns. I’m happy for Percy (Tau) who scored two goals, because he does everything right but score. I think he should have scored a hat-trick. “It will encourage him to score more goals.”Next up for Downs are Golden Arrows at Princess Magogo Stadium on Sunday, in the first of their four remaining fixtures this year.
