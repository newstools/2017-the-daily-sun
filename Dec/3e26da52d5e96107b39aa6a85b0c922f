After the roof and wall had collapsed, the Shoprite store closed business briefly but opened its doors later on during the day. A visibly shaken man, who said he worked at one of the shops in the building, said: “We got closer and saw a large portion of the roof had caved in, leaving construction workers trapped.“Most of them managed to escape unharmed, but three of them were not so lucky.” He said they were too scared to help the injured workers.“We called an ambulance,” said another witness.“Paramedics quickly arrived and the injured were rushed to hospital.” Construction company workers at the scene refused to talk about the matter when the SunTeam tried to ask what may have caused the accident. But Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson confirmed that patients were stabilised on the scene and sent to hospital for medical treatment. “The police were also at the scene and they will be investigating the matter,” Jamieson told Daily Sun.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Newlands East police were attending to the matter.But no case was opened.
