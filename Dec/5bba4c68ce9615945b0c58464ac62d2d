In the process of initiating boys to men, we have experienced children dying, especially at illegal initiation schools,” said the MEC.She announced that in partnership with the CRL, the department has issued a temporary prohibition.“We are putting a moratorium until 2018 to fix illegal schools.“No initiation must take place until the commission has given a thumbs up to say initiation schools are in order.”Social development’s head of department Makhuku Mampuru said: “We have an interest in children. If they happen to be in that space we develop an interest in their wellbeing. Law enforcement agencies have to make sure that all that is done illegally must stop.”Community Services MMC Katty Rakitla advised those wanting to go to initiation school to do so in other provinces.
