But Minnaert said they wanted him to do individual assessments of all the players, which he said he didn’t have time for. Then he was fired.According to the termination letter, he was supposed to return the team’s equipment, including a car, before 5pm yesterday. “I told Elijah I’d bring the goods before 5pm,” said the coach from Belgium.Later when he was at home, he said he heard a car starting up outside.“I went outside and found Elijah in the car. I stood in front of it and he drove backwards and forwards. He struck me with the car and I jumped out of the way because I didn’t want to be run over, and fell on my back. Elijah then sped off.”Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said: “A case of reckless or negligent driving was opened. Initially, a case of assault was opened and after preliminary investigation, the case was changed. No one has been charged.”
