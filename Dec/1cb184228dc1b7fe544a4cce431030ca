Thailand, it seems the secret lovers carried out their plot to get rid of
Nontiya. Chueysombat is suspected to have driven Panchart to meet
up with Nontiya. He was armed with a gun, and allegedly fatally shot her in her
room. Chueysombat then drove him away from the murder scene and helped him get
rid of the illegal gun and his clothes in a nearby canal.It seems the gold and money meant for Nontiya and
Panchart’s wedding mysteriously disappeared about the time Nontiya was
murdered.Chueysombat faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder
and illegally owning and carrying a weapon. Panchart faces the same charges, as
well as a murder charge.He apparently confessed all to cops the night after
Nontiya’s death.The two suspects are currently awaiting trial in a prison
in southern Chumphon province, said the report.
