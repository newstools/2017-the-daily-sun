Local dance groups entertained the guests while speaker after speaker praised the mall and the department. The department’s Virginia Tleane said they host a lunch for people living with disabilities every year. “We want them to know that they are part of the community, and when everyone celebrates they too should celebrate.” She praised families who brought relatives, noting it was not easy to manoeuvre wheelchairs around crowds of shoppers “with discounts on their minds”.Region 6 Disability Forum’s Ernest Furumele said their members had a good time. “We felt special, a red carpet was rolled out for us, and we were given toiletries. We were the envy of shoppers,” he said.
