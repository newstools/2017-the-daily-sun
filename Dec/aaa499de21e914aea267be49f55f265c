It institutionalised corruption and it besmirched the reputation of the ANC."Selfe said there was only one way that newly-elected ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa could assert his authority and end the farce, and that was by recalling Zuma from the position of South African president.Zuma lodged his appeal against the fell Bench state capture judgmentÂ on Friday.He submitted that the court had erred in law when it ruled that he was ill-advised and reckless when he launched the application to set aside Madonsela's remedial actions in her State of Capture report.The DA accused Zuma of "simply playing for time, delaying the inevitable, and wasting the time of the courts"."He clearly wants to delay the appointment of the commission for as long as possible, so that witnesses can forget and evidence can be destroyed."It is instructive that his decision to appeal appears to be at variance with a decision of his own conference, not even a week ago, to the effect that the commission should be appointed as soon as possible," said Selfe.He said Ramaphosa, as the new president of the ANC, ought to reign Zuma in and described Zuma as being "reckless"."He is undermining the reputation of the Presidency and provoking a showdown with the courts. And he is doing it on taxpayers' money," he said.Earlier, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said Zuma should step down and allow Ramaphosa to appoint the judge to conduct the inquiry into state capture.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/da-to-oppose-zumas-state-capture-appeal-20171222
