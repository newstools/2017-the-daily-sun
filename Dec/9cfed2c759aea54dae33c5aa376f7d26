    BLESSING Jubane is lucky to be alive today. The 26-year-old missed death by minutes on Monday morning when a Toyota Quantum taxi crashed into her salon! She had gone out to buy hair products at a hair boutique. Just minutes after she had left, her mastand phoned her to say a taxi had smashed into the shop in Winnie Mandela Park in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstvD5iKuLqeZ1-zXaPDPmiSOI3FhX60OxWT0lCJYdKgra1LbXX7r_X2tATqI76Nm4U3ZIgVvpzmFMV2NFhYUhCwZVAInypFOXDHX0MpmDCFaUx2S9udG3vxoSUnkU1nsyrqayllf-W47J9c7UB0G9E5iTSCMUZJJRagKzThAeurZ3DUsAj5mS4nk5A-jr9KFBlIzOipY5DNz5Aq2gRhu48GFyFoZ5J1z3Km4K9xntNRU2NebfEWHpHp3gtsrEZdnlpAGH-PZISa3nCt3QWUQRzZo971qV4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFtSn_K8_Wb8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I was shocked when I found it had been smashed to pieces. I lost everything I had worked so hard for,” she said. Her mastand, Nompilo Vilane (58), said the taxi was travelling at high speed when the driver lost control while trying to overtake another vehicle. “We heard a loud bang after the Quantum driver lost control. He swerved when another taxi came driving towards him head-on. He ended up crashing into the salon,” said Nompilo. Blessing said although she was left traumatised by the accident, she was grateful that no one was injured. “I will now be forced to use all the profit I made throughout the year to rebuild the salon and buy stock,” she said.
