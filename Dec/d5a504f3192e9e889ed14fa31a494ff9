    This mlungu produces remarkable moving gardens. While most people think vegetables can only be planted in the ground, Thabo Olivier (49) has proved them wrong. He lives in Bayswater, near Bloemfontein and has planted four kinds of vegetables in one container.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvm_tWGHnSLQibnXTZ1SidcC8t1tljRmtW0ErDLy31vO8PhMQkvrRpDhqiPw0xWngwk7RUbA39gH49EbLLne89USnHUslRNkiVaUZFhCrAtCPuKgA4XMtpq8h3AkbBafL8eEtqHd-XYdad4PFNV5KmLGZoC2E7ZWrqttLOv3RBLlATYu4NL5CZBBd5fiZCK-aW5nvUHSvJtjSDJwanN9qHKdAlWhIo_fXeTPipE6XZNFExihO3zYXBThy0tu7-PtmyxJXffseR877b7DC2YIJWNToCAgZk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJRK6NGPEp6vEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I call it a tree of life,” he said.Since the vegetables are not planted in the earth, they can easily be moved from one place to another. Thabo, who grew up speaking Sesotho, said his Qala Tala (Start Green) garden has been doing well for years.“I am passionate about reducing poverty and ensuring food security,”Thabo combines his talents, passion and influence to ensure that sustainable food gardens are established all over the Free State. His yard is a demonstration of what can be done in a very small area at low cost.He grows his vegetables in three layers. The frames are made from second-hand tarred poles covered with low density shadow net to create a hothouse effect and protect from frost. Most of the material he uses can be picked up at dumpsites. He uses home-made compost and diluted chicken manure as fertiliser and the insecticide consists of habanero chillies, garlic, onions and a very little diswashing liquid sprayed on the plantsThe light rays reflected from old CDs swinging on strings control the birds. When it rains, he uses rain water harvested from the roof of his house and stored in Jojo tanks. Thabo’s main aim is to sow not only in the soil, but in people’s lives. He assists people to establish vegetable gardens and helps them get contracts to deliver their extra crops to shops.
