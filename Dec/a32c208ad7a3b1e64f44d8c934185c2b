We want the municipality to sort out their issues with the rubbish collectors for our health’s sake,” said Joyce.Sicelo Dlamini (38) from D section said he had to keep his windows closed all the time to avoid the terrible smell.“The municipality should come up with alternative ways of collecting waste during the strike,” said Sicelo.Tozi Mthethwa, a spokeswoman for eThekwini Municipality, said they had sent workers to urgently attend to the situation. “The team is working hard to resolve this situation and will soon reach all affected areas. We apologise for the inconvenience.”
