He said: “I heard Onke cry for help. He tried to break the burglar door but the fire overpowered him. “His last words were, ‘I don’t have a choice. I am going to die’. He was a humble person. He loved his kids but now he is dead.” When the People’s Paper visited the scene, the crying  boy was looking through the rubble, asking: “Where are my mother and father?”Relative Vuyiseka Bethiwe (31) said: “I saw smoke and thought people were burning tyres. “At the street I saw it was coming from my brother’s house! “I ran there but people didn’t want me to go near. I could not believe my brother and his girlfriend are dead. We believe they were sleeping. It started in the kitchen.” Cop spokesman Frederick van Wyk said: “A man and a woman died on Saturday at 8.40pm. Their house in Bardale, Mfuleni burned down as they were sleeping. Police are investigating.”
