    OUTSPOKEN Benni McCarthy has again risked the wrath of the Premier Soccer League with scathing comments regarding officials.The Cape Town City coach has called the performances of referees “poor” in his assessment of refereeing this season.This was despite having guided City to a gutsy 1-0 victory over Mamelodi Sundowns in their last Absa Premiership fixture of the year on Tuesday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuzea-3jgC0Bsu5ZxENdQeffKZ7hq5KLNBrgsIVufHkg5g5mh9aklUx8HIL97ov7klIBgKchnaQRC0xuHKbE-yvjVef4uKvlUitdMG50OcS5IpZ5upJxQ8hUPEokS6L3PxnZmGHLuNxXXxZ_5Bb_9UzejPzKUqmE9m-yn1mhJ73-wSnuj09QJK5C0EhAxEv-vlxE5gb2o-xaqU9T_JXSfLzFiMP9NWhF6T7S2v0zb1URcX-GFOZu0Q3oaLDFUzhGrntaBQ2nyI9JiR72kGVHZxoPA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzL1ywyt0tvTAEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Do you think that’s normal?” McCarthy said, pointing to referee Christopher Harrison engaging in banter with Sundowns players in the bowels of Loftus Versfeld midweek.“It’s not a laughing matter when our football goes backwards because of bad refereeing. In every single game we are not only playing against the opposition but against referees too.“We (coaches) can’t say what we want because we have to respect the officials, but they don’t have respect for our game. They kill our players and we can’t have an opinion?“Referees must take responsibility. Coaches get fired for not winning, but referees have the luxury of keeping their jobs.“That’s why our league is not at the level where it’s supposed to be with the talent we have. Referees have to up the game.”McCarthy has already faced a charge of contravening Rule 54.3.6 of the NSL Handbook following post-match comments directed at referee Phillip Tinyani.He may be making another appearance before the PSL Disciplinary Committee, as the league frowns on public criticism of officials.In his playing days, McCarthy often sailed close to the wind, frequently running into trouble with Safa.And it seems Bafana’s leading all-time scorer hasn’t lost his passion for the game.But still McCarthy, who has already led the Cape side to the MTN8 Cup final in his first season, commends the competitive nature of the PSL. City finished the year in second spot with 24 points, having overcome their slump to win two matches on the trot.And judging by McCarthy’s remarks on underperforming players, he has clearly made the transition from tricky player to tricky coach.
