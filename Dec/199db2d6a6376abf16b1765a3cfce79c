He said if the issue is not resolved, they will organise the delivery of newspapers in their communities to be stopped. “If the courts fail to resolve this, we will burn those papers because our results are printed in them,” he said. Makele said media houses that print the results do nothing to transform the country’s education system. “They are nowhere to be found when we have no proper classrooms or school uniforms and nothing to eat. “Then they show up after all the struggles we face during the year and release our academic results.” Makele accused media groups of not offering them scholarships, learnerships or bursaries. Matric pupil Mapeka Mokoena agreed with Cosas, saying he knew people who had killed themselves because they had not passed. “It would be easy for everyone if we just got our statements from the schools.” Parent Makwena Moloto (45) said not publishing results will make pupils lazy. “It places pressure on pupils to study hard because they look forward to seeing their results in the paper. “Pupils still kill themselves after seeing their school reports. Ending the publishing of results will not solve anything,” she said.Basic education department spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said they have been in talks with Cosas over the years. “That is why we settled on using exam numbers rather than names. It seems to be working well because the results are available only to those who know their numbers.” Mhlanga said they will consult about the publishing of results. “We receive conflicting input from our stakeholders about this issue but remain open to speaking about it.”
