 What is Listeriosis?
According to food safety guidelines, Listeria is bacteria found in soil, water and vegetation. It can also be found in some animals, including poultry and cattle. Raw milks and foods made from raw milk can also carry the Listeria bacteria.SymptomsPeople should seek medical attention if they experience the following symptoms:
 Fever
 A stiff neck
 Confusion
 General weakness
 Vomiting – sometimes coming after diarrhoea.
Treatment The treatment of listeriosis is usually based on symptoms and depends on the severity of infection. The majority of people infected by listeria recover within seven days. However, those with a compromised immune system such as older adults, infants or pregnant women require urgent medical care. A severe infection may require feeding antibiotics and fluids through an IV drip.
 Home remedies

 Drink plenty of clear fluids such as water and tea.
 Eat the Brat diet which is bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast. It is important to only eat other bland foods that won’t irritate the tender stomach.
 Get lots of bed rest.
Prevention
  Do not drink raw or unpasteurised milk. Beware of food that contains raw milk.
  Practice good hygiene in the kitchen. Wash your hands regularly, and make sure cutting boards, cutlery and crockery are cleaned properly.
  Thoroughly cook animal food such as meat, poultry or fish. Remember, it’s better to overcook than undercook.
  Keep an eye on the expiry dates of perishable foods. Consume the food while it is as fresh possible. – HEALTH24.COM
