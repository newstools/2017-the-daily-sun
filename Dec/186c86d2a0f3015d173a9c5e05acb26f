    A TWITTER spat between EFF leader Julius Malema and
Police Minister Fikile Mbalula over his holiday whereabouts took full flight today
– with Malema warning Mbalula that it would all end in tears."Now you are talking rubbish and when I start you
will be crying like a baby," Malema tweeted in response to Mbalula’s
comments that suggested that Malema was trying to gain votes by criticising
Mbalula’s festive whereabouts.Earlier, Malema posted a tweet criticising the police
minister for going on holiday, allegedly to Dubai, at a time when crime was
high during the festive season: "The whole Minister of Police [is] out of
the country at this critical period of the year, talk of priorities. Crime is a
serious problem in this country but leisure for our ministers is more important
according to the conduct of ...[ANC] ministers, sies."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvZxYnXpq7C55J_aKCidyGywFBBriC-rn_pUjxNcaBp1JaWC6CmjDKViHjpQ5QIuIjjnl4CrcxbUYfkQPcH5rNgCcNutwYyL8BPfH5EdpLr_zRhVV4MWwWhM3ftMDdiFlh2kI1y4qlC5w6QXYGO4bAWRAx9ikURMBfteqjRJetKWwQNZzbdcMRt66pfBDY29RiRAY25BB9uuHY_T3pZI-nbesYPtrVn4TnZFGzeOxoAEGoTq3KpepB-O_14Z_Shi4rxYx_kbFOoEW4Ednev6CU6TNyBfMs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLHYtrgPYlZ7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

with family? Don't b desperate for votes you can do better don't doubt your
support man [sic]."He then suggested Malema "has the unquestionable
right to engage me am not allergic to THAT. I must also clarify him [on]
something, I don't do quite often..."Malema meanwhile began sending out a series of posts
suggesting: "I’m all for the family and you know that very well but timing
is everything, we can’t have the winning team without a leader. You
miscalculated, just accept and come back home now."Mbalula then began his own torrent of tweets about
various crime fighting initiatives underway over the holiday season, even
promising that while "I ain’t the Holy Spirit – I won’t be in all places
at once but the police will."As the banter was bolstered, Mbalula then questioned
Malema about an event he hosted for senior citizens: "How was the Gogos
party you hosted yesterday? I trust the police were sent there to keep the
Gogos and their gifts safe".Malema put out a call that, "The Gogo’s need their
minister", to which Mbalula pledged: "I’m coming Juju – tell the
Gogos their gifts are safe."Malema then posted the hashtag #YenaAyaKwiniDubai. The
phrase "yena aya kwini" is loosely translated as: "Where is
he/she going to?" or in the context of the Twitter spat, could be read as:
"What is he doing in Dubai?"This week, Mbalula tweeted a Christmas message; however
his tweet, which was later deleted, displayed his location as Dubai.Earlier on Wednesday, Mbalula playfully dismissed the
social media frenzy over whether or not he is currently on holiday in Dubai."Uba ndiphi? Ngentlonipho nokuz'thoba noko ayifuni
nina lonto Nina ababuzayo. eStay in yho lane bheka indaba zakho Ngu Dezemba lo
sukuye... #Holidaes Zi big daes!!! (Where am I? With utmost respect, that's
none of the concern of those asking. Stay in your lane; mind your business as
we're in December)," said Mbalula in one tweet."I conclude by saying to those who question my
whereabouts am with my family enjoying my December break Anything beyond that
is Public service overreach. #TimeToReflect #SeasonsGreetings," he added
in another post.He continued with his festive theme, declaring: "Am
on holiday please enjoy yours too this is the time to relax with family...
#SeasonsGreetings from Kuvukiland".The geographical references came back as a later tweet
read: "This Dubai sensationalist some of them they are properbly twitting
from the rooftoptop of burj khalifa.#Dubai [sic]."In another post on the social media site, he referenced
the controversy over Dubai’s association with the Gupta family: "Safa
ngama Gupta [we are dying because of the Gupta] I pitty those who have never
been to Dubai hurry up guys the gates are closing the law is coming that debars
u from visiting Dubai. Bcos it is allegedly owned by the Guptas [sic]."In October, News24 revealed that the Gupta family and
some of their associates established an extensive network of front companies in
and around Dubai that were used to conceal and allegedly launder hundreds of
millions of rand in dubious payments linked to government contracts in South
Africa. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/malema-vs-mbalula-dubai-or-not-dubai-that-is-the-question-20171227
