    ALL hell broke loose at a funeral last week when a man
and a woman openly had sex at a funeral.According to Punch,
a funeral was being held in Umuduru Village in Anambra State in southern
Nigeria. A drunk woman who was allegedly a magosha apparently decided
to put on a “show” and grabbed a young man to poke, right in front of the
mourners.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss35kLONMWLGRwH3_fZnJPUC66f9-xbFHU2Vomj7kbZ1EPwrcBs0RPgI67ftQAsqq9plqI2vKdROs4pt1CTO76d9rdS2RVXxt62XaUFQvKD24d9JNYKylirkvx0tuqncu4xjOn8DSHYvd7EcXPGmpXpg4Ff8EVuKR0icZbQUQV-PztQ0GdhQg7kXfmyCg1VPXsycqtDK2DvHP1N8ZSpTSp2xrBL628bHcaNvH8KqXNpWi0h-BwO62ZXidpHGugg4FsXXjngLqZTzyiCyAknFVQQBiwI1FEi5qKvRA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJoPVu8FrkkPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

them. The woman managed to flee but the man would have been sent to an early
grave if elders hadn’t intervened and rescued him.A source is quoted in Punch’s
report as saying: “It was gathered from an eyewitness that a woman believed to
be a commercial sex worker living in one of the brothels in this community,
apparently under the influence, said she wanted to perform `a show’.“As part of the show, she stripped and dragged a young
man simply known as `Chinwuba’ from Ogboro Umunwaji Village in Ihiala out of
the crowd. Both engaged in a sex orgy right in front of onlookers.“Some angry youths pounced on them and in the process,
the lady escaped. But Chinwuba was not that lucky. It took the intervention of
the elders who restrained the irate youths from sending the man to his early
grave.The elders then decided to punish the man by making him
bring them six cartons of beer and a cash fine. https://punchng.com/anambra-youths-mob-lovers-for-having-sex-at-funeral/
