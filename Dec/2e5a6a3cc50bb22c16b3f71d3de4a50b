    AT THE rate Bafana Bafana are dropping down the Fifa world rankings, SA’s national team cannot afford to lose any more matches going forward, says Safa boss Danny Jordaan.“It does not matter who they are playing,” Jordaan said yesterday when spelling out Safa’s targets for Vision 2022.Bafana are currently ranked 81st in the world and Jordaan wants them to return to a more respectable ranking.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuFBOJKMy800mCzwyrpw5ga3nJ51jJPg55JsQWo6KP8lkkfBlhBd4_9BuYcIo9oDCSFJuldotHLz-TWXnVN5NGdZkSsLYBcl6rLclMF2AOA9wvtMQTToERRIBZUh_VNEdV5uuTpnn2Dg6JBfsRQY_0QiSRrK11Xds82iHe6poTkys1AYISHmbCK1lkED2k_w374eNOuQCZNM-6XnlDPZA_eA0KpBGs6t2VTYE3KXNGICi79K0Lvu5MZMGYRkrK3MejzSDPELVCX_DXRfb5Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMBVlWM_In15EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is always Cosafa and Chan that affect us, taking us down some 20 to 50 slots. Remember, most teams are not willing to release players for these competitions. This means Bafana do not compete with their strongest squad. “Bafana would be performing well and then one of these competitions comes along and we are back to dropping slots. “Maybe we must consider using the Under-23s in the future. When players perform with their clubs, they are withdrawn from Bafana.”Safa national executive member and chairwoman of the technical committee, Natasha Tsichlas, jumped in to add that European countries take their national teams seriously.“When there are international matches, everything stops in European countries to give priority to the national team,” she said. Jordaan spoke to SunSport about Safa’s plans going forward.He confirmed that next year’s Safa elections would be held on 24 March, saying nominations would open next month and close mid-February. Regions are expected to nominate their preferred candidates in that time. A fortnight ago Jordaan indicated that he would stand for re-election as president, saying he had unfinished business, such as the completion of Fun Valley, which is expected to include a 3-star hotel, artificial and normal grass grounds, athletics facilities and recreational parks.He said the Legacy Trust had R200 million left, which must be enough to fulfil all their aspirations, with the hotel, to be approved by members of the trust in January next year, to cost an estimated R100m. The Safa president added that they had a meeting with the Premier Soccer League and planned to launch a Super Cup in 2019 featuring the PSL’s three cup winners (MTN8, Nedbank Cup and Telkom Knockout), NFD champions, ABC Motsepe national champions and PSL champions.Jordaan added that they were very serious about starting a women’s national soccer league and Futsal national league (indoor football).As part of the Nelson Mandela centenary celebrations, Safa has a match planned against  Netherlands, while La Liga has also partnered up with Safa, with the Spanish League bosses committed to bringing one of their top teams to Mzansi.
