Mojapelo, the two suspects aged 35 and 42, were bust soon after committing a business
robberies at a local shop in Mokwakwaila village outside Tzaneen.The pair arrived at the shop and allegedly shot the owner
in the head and took an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing from the
scene. Mojapelo said the suspects were unaware that the cops were on
to them and soon after that, driving the same vehicle they committed yet another
business robbery at Dzumeri and Abel villages in Giyani. This time the police caught up with them in a
well-coordinated operation involving Tzaneen and Giyani cops.Mojapelo said a car chase ensued resulting in the suspects
losing control of their vehicle. "It swerved off the road and into the bushes, they
then abandoned it and fled into the bush, one suspect was injured in the
process," Mojapelo said.The suspects will soon appear in the Giyani Magistrate Courts,
facing charges of business robbery and attempted murder.
