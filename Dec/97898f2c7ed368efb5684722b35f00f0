The ANC is a democratic organisation and we don't have to conform because there are divergent views in the democratic organisation - we are free to express our own opinion..there is nothing as a specific position.They are confident and hopeful that Cyril will emerge victorious."We have also held prayers to ask for God and the ANC ancestors to intervene and clear the confusion and help the Rainbow nation which is being torn apart as we speak," said Mthethwa.They said their support for Cyril is proof that people from KZN are not tribalists., adding the ANC is a non-racial and non-tribal organisation.
