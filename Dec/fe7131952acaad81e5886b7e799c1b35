    IT’S the time of the year when stokvel clubs share the money among themselves that they have saved the whole year. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said that it is likely that thugs will target stokvels at this time of the year.Although Zwane refused to state how many cases of stokvel robberies had been reported this year, he mentioned that this year was better than last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu2GlQBCAf7LW_k7sn0KbutQ6uWDvZlB27KrJih6-tKO5yY6i5YfjNJCZUGx3IYpF0Y4lisN8SNvL1e3gRCka-bltPY7W15v3-UidWdjWduS2tiaMzLNbc15zAdnfWt3272NYO0a74356HuxJbBt9xjpmOrl5g2Dn-g5WTYF25LpKKUKgGaY6q9igU3gerFf1dxwNKJHGUtbgmrwtjxvysGXptylO3OOQ4OwnA_QpjFhxYFPq_sFxn-jzR5A41cVKMtBDckIS0VFKR58417JgVEtsUdTkQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEMGw1n_8d3jEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have noticed the positive results this year as the number of stokvel robbery reports has decreased. “Usually at this time in previous years, we would already have received many reports of robberies,” said Zwane.The latest incident happened in Tongaat, Durban on Friday where stokvel members were robbed of R77 000 they had just withdrawn from the bank. The stokvel members were allegedly travelling in a bakkie which was blocked by stones on the road near a sugarcane field.Men were hiding there and ambushed and robbed them.Another incident happened in Ndwedwe, northern KZN last Tuesday. “More than R28 000, kept in a stokvel member’s house, was stolen by thugs who broke into the house.Zwane said they warn those who have not shared their money to make use of banks.“People must stop keeping money in their houses. “They can easily be targeted by thugs. They must also stop withdrawing huge amount of money. “We recommend sharing the money into bank accounts. “It’s a fact that thugs make stokvels their target at this time of the year,” said Zwane.He also warned residents from carelessly exposing their money in public places.“This is the spending season for most residents. “Avoid showing the money you are going to deposit in an ATM while waiting in the queue,” he said.
