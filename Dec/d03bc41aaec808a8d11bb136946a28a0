After he passed, he moved on to grade 11 this year. His devastated father John Jiyane said he collected the report but gave it to Lunga as he was rushing somewhere. “I didn’t think he would open the report. “By the time I got home, his body had already been taken down. I am devastated.“He could have spoken to someone.” John said they encouraged Lunga to study hard. “His mum reminded him to study every day and I told him to set goals and work hard. He must have been disappointed when he failed.”John said he regrets giving Lunga the report. “Maybe this could have been prevented,” he said. Granny said Lunga’s death has affected his siblings, especially his twin sister.“If it wasn’t for the support we got from the Gauteng Education Department, we wouldn’t be able to cope. “MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited us and arranged counselling. The school has been so supportive as well,” said Granny. She said she will never forget what happened and is praying for strength. “I need to accept it so I can move on. “But I will never forget.”  Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said the department was sad about the incident.He reminded all pupils that suicide is not a solution because there are interventions and support available for pupils. “It is regrettable such an incident occurred as the department is working with NGOs to offer support,” said Mabona.
