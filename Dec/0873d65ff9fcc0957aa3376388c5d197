He could not be found for hours. “Later he came back. He laughed at the warders and went back to his cell,” said the source.“The other prisoners, as well as the warders, call him the snake man and he is feared. No inmate or warden wants to anger him because they don’t know what he will do.”Puleng Mokhoane, Correctional Services spokeswoman for the Free State, said the allegations are false.“The said offender has not been in custody since the 30 January as he was on parole,” she said.“On 29 November he reached his sentence expiry date and so he is effectively an ex-offender. We were told that he had bought a maroon BMW but management investigated the matter and found it to be untrue.” She said that in every lock-up and unlock procedure, the offender was counted like all other offenders. “At no stage was the offender absent,” she said.
