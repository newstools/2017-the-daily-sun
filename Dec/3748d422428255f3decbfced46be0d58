I told my neighbours but it was too late. “His clothes were burnt into his skin and his eyes had popped out of their sockets. “The man died a painful death. “I don’t know where he lives but I know he used to steal things to sell at the local scrapyard. “He was trying to steal copper cables but ended up losing his life.”Police spokesman Constable Maselela Lang said: “Cops opened an inquest docket after a 31-year-old man was electrocuted.”
