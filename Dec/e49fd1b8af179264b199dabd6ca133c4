    STUDENTS who have not yet applied for funding from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme will have to find other ways to pay their fees next year. Basic education director-general Hubert Mweli said this in Tshwane yesterday, the closing day for new applications. “Students, parents and guardians are cautioned that NSFAS will not open another window for new applications after the cut-off date, as doing so will delay the process of finalising funding lists,” he said. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuNoujpi-Ooea7RIpUcE9LqIK8XxjvCkeUfawSE9KfamemyPCRI_4NthLaxxkMCeAIlF6bwPg-pAMJdmRJw15cYEgKhR_EmHz_8QKUFtV0qrkyMm4Qwqv-a46ckvISCbAiPL29ZiXFMHGx_bOYdvsyNNIWcqJcgXEIACAeTTp8UOPDB0fOdZzy90p2OkjINL9D2drkt8y9bc3IjqZ__MWMk6LjLrR6JxFO1udawVKE9w3VmvA2R9lvqRUGnTAiOEXJZBE6gC195kfawyAnE8CFf8pSgRlk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDJc5x9_z97eEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said this year the basic education department had placed a lot of emphasis on security and protecting the integrity of final exams. Mweli said marking had started and was expected to be completed by 15 December. “The results will be announced by the minister of basic education on the fourth of the next month,” he said. “Preparations are also under way for the basic education lekgotla, which will take place early next year.”Speaking about improvements made in the social development sector, Mweli said social service professionals had been identified as having scarce skills. “Treasury has allocated money to address the absorption of 556 social work professionals.”
