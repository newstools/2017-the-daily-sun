the number of grievances handled by the Public Service Commission up to
the end of September 2017 increased by 126 cases, as compared to 187 reported
cases during the first quarter. The Commissioner said most of the grievances by public
servants related to unfair treatment and salary problems.He said they dealt with 313 cases, including 86 cases carried
over from the previous financial year. "Of the 313 cases, 122 were not properly referred and
191 were properly referred cases," he said. Seloane said the 191 cases were dealt with through investigation
and meditation. He said the other 122 cases are classified as not properly
referred because aggrieved employees referred cases to them with no proof that
their grievances were properly lodged with their departments. Seloane said the financial disclosures for the 2016/2017
financial year were submitted to them in terms of the Public Service
Regulations of 2016. He said they have started a process of looking at all the
financial disclosure forms received to determine the full disclosure of registrable
interest and prevalence of conflicts of interests among members. He said the Eastern Cape has the highest vacancy rate at
22.6%. "The Public Service has 1 307 552 posts, of which 1 172
633 are filled and 134 919 are vacant, the vacancy rate at national level is
7.5%," he said. Seloane said the highest vacancy rate is at
administrative/operational level within the public services. He said the total number of terminations over the period is
higher than the total number of new appointments across the public services. "The Western Cape and Free State had more appointments
than termination over the period," he said. He said reasons for termination included retirement,
resignations, contract expiry, death and dismissal.
