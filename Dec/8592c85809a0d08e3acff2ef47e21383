The customers would then drive by the couple’s home and throw their payments on the lawn.The child endangerment charges were filed because Baldassarre’s nine-year-old daughter lived in the home, where police say they found syringes and drugs believed to include methamphetamine, LSD-laced candy and powdered fentanyl.The girl was turned over to her mother. – NEWS24
