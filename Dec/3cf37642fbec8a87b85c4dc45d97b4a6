    CAPE Town City must have forgotten what it feels like to win a match. The last time they tasted victory was a month and a half ago on 1 November when they defeated Free State Stars in the Mother City. The score was 1-0.Since then, getting three points for Benni McCarthy’s side has been as difficult as predicting who will win the ANC presidential race. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssw62hW1mLkpEu_sQl4ufvknW7gmFdFMVFSdk541-vBZ5Li1p4bvJw1PrFIuRs2dAwl4gS5zxnIWN1vOzfYsoT6tyQIYDsjV2ba9Llvu9y2faFSLyfUF23FIRGxxropxn9hLr1lIZZFqPJyjMaZ8VaeJ7-SrKSsLCCCjGUgxpJBhfcMfaSgWMTm9-Cv5Otl7PZf6l6wx6Nhl8K1fsgdjY-9JlTJ6VnRqxWtoQjEG3AApsYTFzaaJTi_nismhwiLdzCYojItqNQ7Fa8wuFA0zMoyJQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNdQfm3sD6svEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They were then nailed 4-2 by Fadlu Davids’ Maritzburg United before registering another unimpressive 1-1 draw when they travelled to Mbombela Stadium to face SuperSport United. That has dragged McCarthy’s charges down to seventh position in the Absa Premiership table.  On Friday, they have a big opportunity to redeem themselves when they come up against AmaZulu at the Cape Town Stadium. Kick-off is 8pm. The lack of winning results has McCarthy hot under the collar. Not one afraid to voice his opinion, the former FC Porto and Blackburn Rovers striker again hit out at his players. “My players just do not listen to instructions. Maybe I don’t speak the proper language to my players because the simplest things they do not do right,” McCarthy was quoted as saying after Saturday’s match against Matsatsantsa a Pitori. City will rely on the likes of Aubrey Ngoma, Sibusiso Masina and Lyle Lakay to turn their good run of form into a win.AmaZulu, on the other hand, have seemingly jumped on the bandwagon of draws – along with many other PSL teams – with their last three matches all ending in stalemates. Usuthu will be hoping that Mhlengi Cele is on top of his game and that veterans Mabhuti Khenyeza and Siyabonga Nomvethe will give the City youngsters a run for their money.
