She said she was preparing for Christmas lunch when she received the sad news. “I received a call from my daughter’s boyfriend that she was no more.“I did not believe him until later that day when I got a call from my husband, confirming the news.” Lydia said she immediately went to Bloemfontein, where her daughter lived. “I lost my son in December 2008. He was a soldier. Now it is my daughter.” Lydia said what hurt her most was that she and Ntsoaki had planned to visit his grave. A neighbour said Ntsoaki’s unemployed boyfriend was abusive.“He was financially dependent on Ntsoaki, and she often bought him booze.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said the suspect told cops he last saw the victim on Friday after they had an argument. “The suspect (40) was later arrested on Sunday and charged with murder, following investigations.“He will appear in court soon.”
