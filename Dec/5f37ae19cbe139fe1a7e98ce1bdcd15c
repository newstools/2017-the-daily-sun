One pulled out a gun and threatened to kill him on the spot.Fearing for his life, he ended up opening the burglar bars in front of the counter.“They told me to sit on a chair and put my hands behind my head while they kept on harassing me, demanding more money,” he said.“They then got angry and agitated. One of them stabbed me in the knee with a knife while the other pointed a gun at me.“I kept telling them I only had R10 000.”Shahzad said his assistant, Samson Sithole (19), was also ordered to keep quiet and lie on the floor.“They left in a hurry and one of them forgot to take his cellphone. We used it to call the cops.” Samson said the incident scared him to death. He said he was held down with the knee of one of the robbers. “I thought they were going to kill us but they left after taking what they wanted.” KwaMhlanga police spokeswoman Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu confirmed that a case of business robbery was opened but said no one had been arrested yet.
