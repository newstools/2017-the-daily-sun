Smith headed home Aubrey Modiba’s cross with 15 minutes to go to earn United a precious point in a dream debut.Phunya Sele Sele were looking to bounce back from their 4-1 away loss to leaders Mamelodi Sundowns last weekend. The players were hoping to welcome coach Vaselin Jelusic return, who missed the Downs clash as he was in his native Serbia on a coaching course last week and returned on Tuesday afternoon, with a win to end the year on a high note.Celtic finish the year with 20 points in eighth place after 14 fixtures while United end in 11th with 16 points but have played only 11 matches due to the fact they are playing catch up due to reaching the final of the Caf Confederation Cup at the end of October.United have not won any of their last five league matches that have produced three draws and two defeats. Tinkler has a big job on his hands lifting his players who face a massive eight matches in January. But last night’s fightback will have pleased the United mentor.
