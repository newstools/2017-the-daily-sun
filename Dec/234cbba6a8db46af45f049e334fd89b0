The fire was eventually put out,” he said.Ward Councillor Geoffrey Pullan said he visited the area to assess the damage and talk to the victims.“I am still trying to get help for them. Before getting temporary shelter, they need food and blankets. “I informed the eThekwini Municipality’s disaster management about the incident but it looks like something held them up,” he said.Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said no case had been opened.Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the disaster management team responded to the incident to conduct an assessment. “Temporary relief like blankets, food and mattresses are being handed to the victims,” she said.The Canelands shack fire follows a similar incident at Bellair Road in Cato Manor on Saturday.
