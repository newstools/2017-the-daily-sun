If you compare it to last year, only three teams are back. It shows players are doing their homework. And not only the players have improved, there’s more quality coaching too,” she stated.Ellis revealed that there are some Queens who have impressed her and they stand a chance of getting the nod for the national team.She said: “If players raise their hands we will give them an opportunity in the national team. Those who are part of Banyana should not relax and drop their standards or they will be replaced by those who are doing well. “There are a couple of players not yet part of Banyana who have caught our eye. We will monitor them until the end of the week and see what happens. So far I am impressed!”Ellis has made history by becoming the first South African woman to win the Cosafa Women’s Cup both as a player and as coach when Banyana clinched the tournament in Zimbabwe in September. She won it as a player in 2002.
