    MANCHESTER United have the talent to cope with Paul Pogba’s absence during their top-of-the-table showdown with Manchester City, fellow-midfielder Juan Mata has said ahead of Sunday’s Premier League Manchester derby.In another derby also on Sunday, Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno is doubtful for the Merseyside derby against Everton after sustaining an injury in Wednesday’s 7-0 Champions League win over Spartak Moscow, manager Juergen Klopp has said.Pogba, who has scored three league goals and provided five assists in eight appearances for United this season, impressed in the 3-1 win at Arsenal last weekend but was dismissed in the second half for a reckless tackle on Hector Bellerin.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst2TVKN9-z9EO2o9w9BrprBtYFox9cuBMNoi_B9HRUAaoCvy477_2hUaDTQ9JlyFq0f9W4oHBAAUBRvMQbE4F_xIzBom82kopqR6yOIA-xbHKFkiDN1a7-Iv03YtlfQc4eDu_sg-kUhoYOER7TpN9FfqnZF_MEPfNwgMvF4a1d2nmOdhzAstV8xNajfd_sjpNorJ75cSmKPyCtPOdiaf9cTpDKBhnsHT1DC_Zu9NGvnwo_kxhIfOnGpKXLJ3vkrNjGVObQPrc8jGwkDRUWr\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHz1wAlVwfqeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He’s a very complete midfielder, he can do all things. He will be a big miss but another player will play and try his best,” Mata said.“I think we have a good squad and have good players to replace any other player. “Hopefully we can win for him.”Mata underlined the importance of a United win at Old Trafford, saying it was vital for the club to build momentum ahead of a busy festive period.“We are doing what we have to do,” the Spaniard added. “We would love to be first in the table right now but I think we are doing lots of good things.“Now, especially on Sunday and during Christmas time, when it is difficult to win every single game, as everyone knows, we need to keep that pace if we want to be in a position to challenge for the title. Hopefully we can do it.” – REUTERS
