It could give us a head start and is ideal preparation for the World Juniors (U-20 Championships).” Mlenga says their goal is to do better and raise the bar next year: “We are inspired by what Akani and Wayde van Niekerk have achieved and want to follow in their footsteps. The U-20 Championships are a big event on the calendar and we want to keep doing what we do to the best of our ability.” The three athletes are good friends and train together as their quest to be the best continues.
