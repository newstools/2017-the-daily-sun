    FOR three years residents pestered the municipality to cover the huge holes. Their pleas fell on deaf ears, but all of that changed last week when Thando Makhanya (2) fell into a water-filled hole and drowned.  On Tuesday, municipal workers covered the holes in Marikana near Lindelani. Residents thanked Daily Sun for publishing an article about the death. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu5999GZ20ZPLYIP6Q0J80DSB35vyMyyaluiA_lINyKbgNmGOm_PMHAoRIxJhf_ZuobBhh3gt21oIME73fNJuYZPaDhFHTBR3qyHvzusMjKoIc787vjp_n93QQtYUGRxFire21QpdSFsoy0wTI2Bo_HSr3dUr3OtScz5EMetYSOFpNrSoQC6c0T4M2Wp6NhLa0HsSK6jnr4MObyWf3LMkxBTzp5nIrS-E7870h30ghDzqx55fRT3B8qzaF56GXOXYRK6Jj9KhsMuSnEArSTzh1akRTJTT0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBrOsUsTUfjVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A child died, but it means nothing to them,” said a resident. Residents claimed whenever they complained, the municipality told them it was not its job to cover them up. On the day of the accident, the SunTeam went to the kasi and saw four deep holes that had water in them.  When the SunTeam returned to the kasi yesterday, all the holes had been closed.  Zinhle Makhanya (23) is still trying to cope with the death of her son. “It’s hard for me to even look at the spot where the hole was,” she said.  “I’m praying to God to give me the strength to keep going.  “This Christmas will be meaningless without my son.” Municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe said the holes were closed on Sunday.  He said the contractor helped bury Thando last Friday.
