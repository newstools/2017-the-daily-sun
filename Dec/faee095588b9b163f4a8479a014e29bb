I plant vegetables such as pumpkins, butternuts, spinach and cabbages. “There are many monkeys here, but I identified this one by the big black patch on its back.”SPCA spokesman Bongani Mthembu warned residents not to be cruel to animals and to respect their rights.“Cruelty to animals is condemned,” he said. “Like other animals, monkeys are also protected by the law.”
