    THE ANC in Eastern Cape has called for tough action against people implicated in the Public Protector’s report on government’s expenditure on the funeral of the late former president, Nelson Mandela. Madiba died on 5 December 2013 and his funeral was held at his rural home, Qunu outside Mthatha.  ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi has called on Premier Phumulo Masualle and all relevant government agencies, such as the Hawks and National Prosecuting Authority, to take action on the findings by Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu5P3La4sa-4jQucgwkfnmXTWsBft4BSkoC07ZLgTkQlluAeSXBlG0pPNlbuBhYEbjpodu2miJOreSdm6KqyoPTX8zVMNmPF9nZX4feEm1GtcW5DgB2BwFdPq7A9A0OGi2OykPTPl30-tEqYJsF4tFIpjN3ayzemwfiymuvwk5mdkXKUoIp4ilu5CJ34MsOSQiN6TBPCzh56A2yHwJyfhBgiSY0zvFSQDIIk7er5DVwO1Mg-bH7cNYYGNSufQIdDcoizLByQdHv4aYZNAofa7n8xtrl4hE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBX3doVkkm_JEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On Monday the public protector said an investigation had unearthed evidence of massive inflation of prices, misappropriation of funds, poor planning and disregard for supply chain regulations during the memorial and funeral of Madiba. The R300 million was apparently misspent by the Eastern Cape provincial government, Eastern Cape Development Corporation, Buffalo City Municipality, Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality. Ngcukayitobi said: “This report is exceptionally significant for our growing democracy, because it will hopefully shed some light on the level of influence, corruption and meddling by some sections of business in our government’s affairs.”
