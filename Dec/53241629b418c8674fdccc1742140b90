    KAIZER Chiefs have bolstered their attack with the signing of Siphelele “Stash” Ntshangase from Baroka FC.An insider at Baroka told SunSport that Amakhosi boss Bobby Motaung has been quietly negotiating with Bakgaga management to avoid the player being snatched up by another club.The insider revealed that Ntshangase was stopped in the middle of Baroka’s training session yesterday to ensure he signs the deal, which also involves out-of-favour Chiefs winger William Twala. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstG4HjNCTQ6-fTcpX_3e8gZByfl9GEJxHFt9KSW8lZ7nlboRitCjxL3B0-V_SZkETcvnuI2Ca1i-_edMdKiXQjUXdL9vFvc_sbt5PL_FF9r2tFunJcoRHjyOSBieEh75YTGl8bwLzW6iTI2yM-WyCpHAynoSPVcGvld0hMhkcIPB4-1RSnnSzobOxoSonGSyeVTxXu76yWtRjH2b5nUdEzKkkGdpRjXkoGHuLSWr-grPqjfdwmTH3I-exvAnp0EXJtlMWk84-GgcQ0e_Lb9\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHh5b7qv1f5YEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He left in the middle of training to finalise his move to Chiefs,” said the insider. “The coach was surprised when Doctor Khumalo (technical director) broke the news to him in the morning. “Ntshangase will start training with Chiefs no later than next Tuesday. I cannot reveal figures at the moment but Twala will switch to Baroka,” added the source.Ntshangase has not made much impact at Baroka and has played in fewer than 10 of the 15 Premiership matches of the first round. Explaining his absence, Thobejane told reporters the player had influenza. But it was reported last month that the 24-year-old midfielder was not happy at Baroka, as his heart was already in Naturena.
