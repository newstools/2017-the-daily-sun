But the doctors said I did not have diabetes and that worried me. My girlfriend threatened to leave me if I didn’t please her as I used to. “She dumped me in September. That was after I tried the Viagra tablets the doctor prescribed to me.”But Tshediso’s life changed for the better when he started drinking the traditional beer better known as umqombothi. A few cartons of traditional beer are all he needs to turn his sleeping 4-5 into a rock hard rod of passion.“I only need to drink three cartons a day to keep my girlfriend happy all night. “A carton only costs R10.”“Traditional beer gives me the energy I need at night. “Whenever I drink this traditional brew, my girlfriend does not get less than three rounds. Tshediso’s new girlfriend (33) said he is a master in bed.“He keeps telling me about the sexual problems he used to have. But after what I’ve seen, it’s hard to believe. “He is a monster in bed. “Unlike my previous boyfriends, he does not get tired easily.”
