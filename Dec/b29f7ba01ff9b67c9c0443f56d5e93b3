The Communication Workers Union (CWU) is currently seeking concurrence on the offer with their members and they will revert to us when that process is completed," he said.SABC acting group chief executive officer, Nomsa Philiso, said negotiations were quite tough as all parties had to find each other in reaching a solution."With the organisation dealing with a financial situation which is not ideal, we have had to strike a balance between taking care of employees, which is a priority and ensuring we do not put further stress on the finances of the SABC," said Philiso.Kganyago said the SABC expressed its gratitude to all managers and staff members who kept the ship afloat during the protest action.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sabc-reaches-wage-agreement-with-bemawu-20171216
