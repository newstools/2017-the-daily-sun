    THE nominations for the ANC’s top six positions have produced a mixed bag and could put paid to a factional “winner takes all”.The much awaited nominations last night confirmed the front-runners as Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC MP Nkosaza Dlamini-Zuma.Consolidated nominations put Ramaphosa ahead with 1 469 over Dlamini-Zuma’s 1 094. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstvNFF4qF1VT3NrPCtUeiezOeoCrcvlNI9u9yK5LuGNHtHfqaPOcPML4QOi4oDqGM0j68iamSGVeB6rsbuPvu3e1cGcrv66B2WImHkvyOpDDbcCUDE5hppHAcBNqPEGgbCmIMfPsfm10zAONeg1iSc8XmaoSTMo2HdjFGXqz2k4eTrXfRYhfummNbjYZCdizALwXsYYLDXNRPYpuBBjFCFiqP-qu_imzOXbL5oZUkz_-mCYdtoJGltOQzSiib2kBrBUcKtIniIcQBu3SeDTgub5wc0PQDw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE3oCa6pZd3nEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He is leading with 1 128 to her 619.If delegates vote according to this pattern, it would mean Mabuza becoming Ramaphosa’s deputy, although from a different slate.The margins are even wider in the battle for the secretary-general position, where Senzo Mchunu (1 479), is contesting on the Ramaphosa slate while Ace Magashule (930) is on the Dlamini-Zuma slate.Even more confusing is that Paul Mashatile has accumulated 1 581 for treasurer-general under Ramaphosa while Maite Nkoana-Mashabana, under Dlamini-Zuma, has 275.For this position, Nomvula Mokonyane, who had more nominations at 289, withdrew from the race. The trend continues in the other positions of the top six.Ramaphosa campaigners were still confident of victory last night.“The issue of Mabuza and Sisulu was always going to be 50/50, but we know there are a lot of people in Mpumalanga who hate Mabuza and we will get those votes,” said a Ramaphosa lobbyist.Voting got under way late last night and the results are likely to be announced today.Discussions involving constitutional changes seem to have delayed the nomination process, which outgoing deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte had predicted would start by late afternoon. By 5pm, however, the delegates were still locked in a closed session, bogged down in the constitutional proposals among other things.
