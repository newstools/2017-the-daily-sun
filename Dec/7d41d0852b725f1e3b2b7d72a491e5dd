I can’t use a bus because I don’t have the money,” said Mandla Dulase (45) from Langa.On Sunday, as Northern Line trains were delayed for over an hour, commuters on their way to church and work complained to Daily Sun.Moses Ngulube (56) from Langa was supposed to go to Mbekweni for a big Sunday service.“They used to give us buses but not this time. We couldn’t get to church. We were deprived of our chance to worship God because of Metrorail.” Walker called on the police to take strong action against thugs and illegal scrap dealers.“A reward of up to R25 000 is offered for information leading to conviction. Full anonymity is guaranteed,” said Walker.Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said: “Monthly and weekly ticket-holders can use their tickets on Golden Arrow buses.”
