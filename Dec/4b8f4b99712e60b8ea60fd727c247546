    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstczroM6WfVrhEBNlt3RTxtigFhp5_fA0Fg0MvsFwGecnAmLR8e0aomJ-B_AaAFEr8qW5tsGBBmti2L0iEITup9JZ4HmqEkGXNPMkDY4ShKgwJc4TjAei9LyCu-5Te4nCiW9qh7mFDN1GpXEa0-LzI-JpAo30ynACL2ypuoakfdnfKMDZpuldsG_OQed1Ee0Ty0dZodTOQGAH5eGb88c01vLOMnN0c42J_fNaXfepTnFhTkl0835Q6rMePlWLBZtDrSDEexivwHhZykm8myThAQ43ti2Ls\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFtjtqrPEXojEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
