    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstLdsKy0xiyZNpb8W6jzjf6TyMTmqfAqPyV-aFuFEGyKGsfTKiAghfb5gMiPvR-MJrHXHn8bt0TjAvCH713e2OVBNpyWQ4pUEGL4gcQMwOuMCihZbb260aQuaswjfH_b21SkOeQwcw3GvxGS4S8-_KkBkt5flRjb9REBJXAPowqAiF3y6qTbsWMGg5H6InHQtGbUSv67NhQfAdyfDBCOkTH0Oiij5_N12eTeJEPG2ZUVPhfU-dbi_ZLQ2aUZI6dCyphAG9a3PbHaa82NgevjbRZaqzRUA4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEPQuDBEK92QEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
