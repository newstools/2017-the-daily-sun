    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst3RfPzySf4yLFRikY2VfwUmRo54eqDrEbnbF-TFe4D2CEEILI8UPjwel73HtQGdsERoAc-2zApfiX7QsxZcwOJIV-tlIga2oZnnS077jdf_-PcQv-Oe8DLpGreC6cZRyZtD1F48N5rb9Zace5xsY81hrzXaj2_QQQsPAJ-qAkk-1p9RZxJ_qbCyQh1QRGOy1fuxv8jGTe3-VWgqEacvQJY36NTNKfpgYaNW3EbAguOLYsWp7Em9l4nzK3fLfTpotK5nXtzKPPUJREl1rYDM9KiXYA9kZs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDXTS1IYQ20hEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
