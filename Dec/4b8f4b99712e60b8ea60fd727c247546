    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuQBxIDcARU1ekdCgnttQRHIZeqW1up3qZzXjLxeygtdX4HiaWVO8G6qV4_gvKGDNj3L_YyXbYGQyh-GOZjfeYkJtCnphLBof-6twIEpARyry4daeEYEG6XK2bZbFz2RW6fn3AW35ShhRCv2xfaHkvbg9FrWfWioin_F2Q-iQu1IEIUufBLBT5RrW4S3zcQcfJXcva6G1BVjmNDlCxeLLR4Ld0GCz3qplRtIxnjiW61AIx54MyVV61Nlh8QOiV4LxpM3X90TnsRyV6-dahUz2k45UdmMlg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCE_uHdJ1x77EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
