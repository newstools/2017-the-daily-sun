    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss0cq1RqDHQRYBUQRFqtjdHjwyaYPbXO8l2PhClRJqCfJ0tM5vsTJiCAAYA4JEukdSFS6Zz32EC4lDQEJ_R_VUUWANbdbRqn22K3NtsX4dqP9rEx-PR91vNrZMI_jMXSrfcIOroEDCu8XJe1kWby4mbnI1M-uCv6WAz5mhF4Ej2QB43z8YpsFjhLOXucqVAxd5pALSwFbHJMcc_1NxY47tk93zXmB_VeSzjGfM2tiFlrBpLgEaH4UUoxWQKd0ZkIUnmYO3hKO6cWAV86RfTA4K3YfcjQrg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHi1HTxgcDIzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
