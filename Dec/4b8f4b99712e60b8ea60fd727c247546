    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_IXuzWFEc038i7JHoKfD7TymqevMWuZ36ZgOVeol5mWFjQpbnuE6Azpt21Sn5xqadqGCOPpbpkPPwj138zZQFGewVt0U7hQUMJSnqzdR2sD7zO6_BnSGp6b9zP8zqrG7rauoI7gJsuDzchBqu9t9Yi9gXU11DMPdMSZVwm2cfiwM4F2QapxdiWBI_5pz3lG8j_KkqGhy6QlD9AXG4A28C6ujlp4QE1GZBeLZ3T43jM-N6gCBO0PLHMntP0IgIEix2_rint2qzzAin0_U1HcNDsy7u4Og\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP6gz3XYDWabEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
