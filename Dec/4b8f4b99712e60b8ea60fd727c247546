    THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstimGALEoG0Ougt_tfTp3ooJWQhkemnzJel_K9Z9hPP2FWm2uZLnWqw1H-roEAvnbB6hY2dT_ckF1lkBYluKcK1x0k9bg5ZNdQCm7KIRVNmFaMlkr_3Wb06bCqUA02ZBVOp1xc5Nb4WboSYxzMR0nFd3M-KCgAEGmuagj3U-jaISF1oPI3wnHPxicdHmKFcRIvE2J9A-oRYu1nyGc6PHIvGoTLvkIkki-FCDgR-k0Fva1W5jIUtTAPkf4G1T0Nu-AQhJHq-qZt-KYL8af2x2WtzUtNsvTQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFM6CxTJMe29EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
