She was renting a room there. She was on her way back from fetching water from a water tank. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKwsJ6anRz4CR0pKio_a4tYfeWmmeord38Ov-c2Gg7be_8EafyV07acN3br3kppJeJmEW9PEWD8XDUwiiocrNLewwBfx3Zq12bfj-9XUKlDGJrAr0mxdezs9EkAWesUnbejXNcaqmCKbgxSyBoqkLRO4kXtSeF92Izbs7cQEBHhy6WWNfycTScCMwtuIX8YIfHwqfV1Ug-dAJmQa_f6RqbmU_52eHSL6u75YOpv0-c6kvPFlixphkBC1XPH13CpWvZz-1XAWgihdzdkny4x9QjoCb_lgA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDlZ72apCuHZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We are told in the news that the rain water is making a huge difference in our dams, yet in KwaNdengezi we still don’t have a water supply.“People are forced to queue at water tankers near the road.” She said she was not in the area when the accident happened. “Witnesses said a speeding car crashed into her, squeezing her into the body of a tanker. “Her legs were severed and she died on the spot. “None of those involved in the accident have been to see the family – not the driver of the car nor the municipality. “We got the accident details from residents who were at the scene,” said Thokozani.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide had been opened. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.EThekwini spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “The water and sanitation unit is aware of the water supply issue affecting the area and is currently looking at solutions.”
