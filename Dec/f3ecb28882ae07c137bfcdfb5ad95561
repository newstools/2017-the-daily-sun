We are told in the news that the rain water is making a huge difference in our dams, yet in KwaNdengezi we still don’t have a water supply.“People are forced to queue at water tankers near the road.” She said she was not in the area when the accident happened. “Witnesses said a speeding car crashed into her, squeezing her into the body of a tanker. “Her legs were severed and she died on the spot. “None of those involved in the accident have been to see the family – not the driver of the car nor the municipality. “We got the accident details from residents who were at the scene,” said Thokozani.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide had been opened. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.EThekwini spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “The water and sanitation unit is aware of the water supply issue affecting the area and is currently looking at solutions.”
