Semen collected from victims point to an unknown man believed to be aged between 25 and 30 years.“We’re working around the clock to catch the man, and we plead with people who have information to come forward,” said Brakpan police spokeswoman Captain Pearl van Staad. “The man pretends to be a plumber from the municipality, repairing either taps, pipes or geysers. “Residents then allow him into their homes. The manner in which he conducts himself shows he is used to the areas.”Van Staad said he threatens his victims with a knife or firearm, speaks Zulu, is clean-shaven, of slender build, and short. In most cases he wears a black or brown beanie. He operates anytime, including weekends, and travels on foot. “Some of his victims are schoolchildren,” she said. He targets them on their way from school and takes them to the veld where he rapes them. Anyone with information should contact Warrant Officer Solomon Malebye on 066 009 7366 or 079 471 8385, or call the CrimeStop number 08600 10111.
