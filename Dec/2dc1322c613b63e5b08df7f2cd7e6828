The villagers said they contacted officials from the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs about the matter, but were referred to the Modjadji Royal House. But villagers claimed the chief wasn’t doing anything about the matter. Ramafalo said the group didn’t want to take instruction. “They’ve now started to spread false accusations about me because they’ve tried to remove me, but were unsuccessful. “They even went to the Modjadji Royal House to report me, but were told to resolve their issues with me,” Ramafalo told Daily Sun. Paena Galane, a spokesman for the department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs, said that the relief of duties of a headman is the responsibility of the royal family concerned.
