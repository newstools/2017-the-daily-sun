She said after she prayed that night, a voice told her to take her frying pan to bed.“I didn’t understand why I couldn’t sleep,” she said.She listened to the voice’s instructions and put the pan under her blanket.“After that, I did fall asleep,” she said.Gogo Nonzwakazi said she still doesn’t know what made her wake up in the middle of the night, but when she turned her head, she saw a shadow sneaking up on her.The brave gogo didn’t scream but silently gripped her trusted frying pan.“When the thug tried to grab me by the neck, I struck,” she said.Gogo Nonzwakazi said she landed a blow on the thug’s head.“He didn’t expect what happened. I think that’s why he ran for his life,” said the gogo, who tried to give chase. But she couldn’t catch the thug because he was too fast.“I don’t know how he managed to gain entry but he left my door open when he ran away,” she said.The gogo thanked God and her ancestors for giving her strength to beat up the thug.She said she has made a habit of sleeping with her frying pan now.Her neighbour, Mzwandile Jobe (56), said: “We didn’t hear a thing and only woke up when the gogo knocked on our door in the middle of the night. “She was still carrying the frying pan.”The gogo told Daily Sun she wasn’t hurt and nothing was stolen so she decided not to go to the cops to open a case.
