She came back home the next day,” she said.“She was walking strangely. When I asked where she had been, she said she stayed the night at a friend’s place. “I realised something was wrong and asked her to undress. That’s when I saw blood coming out of her vagina.”She said it took her almost an hour to convince her to reveal what had really happened that night.“I rushed her to hospital and the nurses confirmed she had been raped,” she said.She said her daughter was tricked into believing the men would take her to the UK. “They promised her they would take her to a new school where she would live a rich life. “My heart is sore. This is cruelty at its best. They must pay for this.” Sergeant Styles Maome said: “The three arrested suspects will appear in the Germiston Magistrates Court today.”
