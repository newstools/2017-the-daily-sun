Heavy water comes into their homes, forcing families to sleep in wet conditions that could make them sick. “Most of these people are unemployed and do not have anywhere else to go. “Government has failed our community as they feel left out,” said Nomthandazo. “Giving people accommodation in this difficult time must be a priority.”Vuyo Xaba (55), a mother of two, said they have lost hope of ever getting help or the RDP homes they were promised.Vuyo said their homes are sinking in water and haven’t been dry since the storms started.“We are entitled to proper homes. We’ve been waiting on empty promises and demand better living conditions. The cold affects us at night and my children are suffering,” she said.Ekurhuleni Emergency Services spokesman William Ntladi said a disaster management team met with some of the families on Monday.
