    A BLAZING fire left 500 people homeless in Chris Hani Park, Strand over the weekend.  The fire started in a shack that was vacant at about 5pm on Friday.“There was no one in that shack so it is hard to say what caused the fire but we suspect illegal connections. We tried to save some of our things but the fire spread too fast. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsthrSmaJy9uxIEut9ShGoueDy-cYhcvzR4QihM91QC7UOqdODqkm70zjkHMmDakVaDTxuofsWlPUM7-4Dcsm8CxhuKOFfKK1l_V5FRJ3yCXaMc1KffwNnH5zBhuruB8E0JGZRlL8PgHTzKegyX2qSjBRBhF_hpko19PnzNsvg0uPAH9DdxeIHI2x1aHpislO0tf-dbAvmmW3QwWdPALGwOQzTY7DaEHvruH7verzuA3blOAlilAKCd0CbPyyKwWgb7cGNJdKAbY2cmg5OVD6okGNXKY0OQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIhVRDsG_y0dEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

With tears in her eyes, the mother of the 13-year-old explained she had no choice.“My son cannot walk and I lost everything because I was trying to save him. It’s very hard to live in a shack with a disabled child. If I had not thought on my feet he would have died,” said Ndileka.Lubabalo Mfihlelwa’s shack did not burn but he asked the government to help. “I am hurt. Most people here lost everything. We still use the bucket system and even the buckets burnt. We have no place to relieve ourselves. We need assistance to be moved from here before we die.”Councillor Buli Madikane said the shacks were built on Sanral land and the City of Cape Town had been fighting for the people to get services.Madikane said Sassa would give the families stipends and Home Affairs would assist with IDs on Monday.Fire and Rescue spokesman Richard Coleman said: “About 100 structures burnt down and one firefighter suffered slight injuries. About 500 people are displaced.”
