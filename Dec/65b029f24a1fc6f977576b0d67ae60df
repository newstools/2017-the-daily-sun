What is the purpose of having officers on the roads if they’re going to hide themselves? Their visibility will surely reduce the number of accidents. Who would speed in front of traffic cops vele?”Freedom Reed: “We all pretend to be good drivers in front of them, as soon as we are in the clear we break traffic rules like it’s a fashion. That’s why they hide, they wanna see how we behave when we don’t see them!”
