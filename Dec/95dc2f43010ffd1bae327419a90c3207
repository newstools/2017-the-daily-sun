Motsoeneng is to lay charges of culpable homicide against paramedics.Â He claims that
they wasted time shout at a mother instead of helping her ill child, who
eventually died.According to Mboro, when paramedics arrived on
scene on Sunday, he begged them to give the sickly child oxygen and other
emergency treatment.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstlcF8sbCE4ch6z2flowGJZ7IGRSio0K3JKD4Hb-t7NUq-ZXF4XdmL_kOrS3FczsmuGeA-Z8CMLtWwRzPxXwAP7eNRzrhhwxhPFFtWYDUaeKhN7siCE60hqEqDudwlp_0cKEtTHHoR6ERQRLvyYedPvMh2ADFhRIQg2nG_bRbaCsRkNSzEBYCU6WDWHgKcuoRd-T_fSJ_xdJSIphUamkq3MD5neKtYki_wGGZorz4u1qvZ2QlrgzD04axwRXQIy46ayXlzoBnfG2tBleqOfn6xxQ-9-qQ4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDCx9z6d3vB8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

reprimanding the mother and accusing [her] of neglecting her child"."Also, without taking a medical history of the
child from the mother, and without asking why the mother took the child to the
church for help, the paramedics simply accused the mother of failing to take
the child to the clinic," Mboro said in a statement. "I told the paramedics that the child appeared
to be dehydrated and needed immediate attention but the paramedics simply
ignored me and continued to berate the distraught mother."Mboro said the mother had brought the very sick
child to see him."All I did was to insist that the child must
be helped, which the EMS personnel failed to do," Mboro alleged.Charges of culpable homicideHe said he would be laying charges of culpable
homicide on Wednesday. The pastor made the statement in response to a
statement from the Ekurhuleni Emergency Management Services (EMS), in which
they alleged that Mboro had assaulted one of the paramedics with the support of
the congregation.EMS spokesperson William Ntladi said an ambulance
crew was called to Pastor Motsoeneng's church in Katlehong around 11:34 on
Sunday."On arrival, the crew took all relevant
medical equipment with [them] into the church building for patient assessment
and treatment. Before they could do anything, the pastor [already had] the
child in his hands [preparing] to load what seemed to be a lifeless body in the
ambulance," said Ntladi.Female ambulance driver manhandled"Confrontation immediately started between the
crew and the pastor during which a female ambulance driver was manhandled on
the scene by the pastor, supported by the congregation."While backup was called, "the terrified driver
had to jump and lock herself in the fire engine for her safety as members of
the church were vying for her blood, shouting abusive language as well,"
Ntladi added.The child was declared dead in the ambulance and
another driver had to be sent to the scene to transport the body to the
government mortuary in Germiston. The paramedic, who was allegedly assaulted,
was hospitalised, Ntladi added.Mboro denied the allegations and said no emergency
personnel were attacked. He said all the church members who were present could
confirm that.Mboro accused the department of going to the media
to cover themselves and "shift attention from their clear negligence, in
that they failed to render the necessary assistance to the distressed innocent
child, who lost her life because the EMS personnel failed to give her the
required oxygen that she so desperately needed".Ntladi could not be reached for comment regarding
the charges.
