    ELECTORAL authorities have been urged to extend the registration period so Zimbabweans in other countries can sign up for a chance to vote.The voter registration process is expected to wrap up tomorrow.There are indications the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission has not reached the targeted seven million voters.Human rights groups pointed out that thousands of Zimbabweans in Botswana and South Africa were unregistered and would be coming home this month.“A good number of these Zimbabweans are living illegally in these countries and may have plans to come back,” said the Zimbabwe Peace Project.The rights group said the extension of the registration process was also justifiable because the rainy season had arrived and most people in rural areas might not have had the opportunity to travel to registration centres.“There are also those who made the time to register but who may have been discouraged by the money demanded by traditional leaders for proof of residence documents,” said the human rights organisation.Traditional leaders are known to victimise opposition supporters and show favouritism towards former president Robert Mugabe, who was removed from power last month.“We are begging the electoral commission to extend the registration period so Zimbabweans can exercise their right to vote,” said the peace project.Voting is expected to take place in August and will be the first time in 38 years that Mugabe will not campaign for another term. – CAJ NEWSif(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssZ5ywT2prt6-NYqhZ8eGLsAG6Z-puW8nQpgqpeeIVCKxKI7braN4iqPFVPzkiFgX5rDRXrKFkszDYmP4DZGiMBLjtML57gYEztjZdP9tL2mA_gD7ZUmnJW0Bb0eyaGBEipqLNq5UyIGhlftS9tkpOWArhQdp3VV8Ek_XNwmKFNuoAbPMSozBuPar-kLCIrmMdgNWKwdv4plQbpzgAFM8l0EYW7P5IbvSrMrsOD1XTMdgYa17vBuXA84iFBFhgyZUgduJUWNtnTXX4zzoihNFaMl2tJDcxh2Pej1Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP87b-GKAr_-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
