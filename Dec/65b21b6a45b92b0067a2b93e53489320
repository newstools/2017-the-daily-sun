    MINISTER of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa has called on all victims of racism at Club Zanandi to come forward. This comes after a woman told the media she and her family were denied entrance to the resort near Hartbeespoort, North West because they are not white. Mthethwa said people who had undergone similar experiences at the resort should take the owners to the Equality Court so they can face the consequences of their actions. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss7NLYaIl0bgCxg0MzVp0Yn79nvdE2TBQmSxXP704E0t8o755BAVGWf_RQo9Rd7PTsj6mxYcKi1AJzGRRcmqJrFtiJ5E_vJNENnaRExCffL-pT5WYrT6HBPHB7Kbgzggo2vgoDpgDBbvUd4UEDoZYp64N3TgbhnH8EkFU8Hcn7bTCjXkE09IksXisadGVWHFJdCUbSWkqJsTrgwD6s7nNDlaxRQFwJ3RUQY9R8KqKeyYzm_ccrWvPzCV_pVBgovkDuvHoLtdGZrQ9-VoaolmvVSMauVhhM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEXwayeO4LGJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We call on the resort to take corrective action immediately.” The woman said she and her family decided to drive to the resort from Centurion without a booking on Tuesday. She said when they arrived, they were told the club was for whites only. Sanco has promised to investigate the incident and called on the South African Human Rights Commission to do the same. Some of the comments made by social media users over the incident: Johan Lewin: “If this is true, shut the place down.” Ravin Singh: “There is no place for racists or bigots of any kind in a democratic South Africa.” Attempts to get hold of the owners of the resort were unsuccessful.
