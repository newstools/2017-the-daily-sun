    IT WAS a sombre day for families who lost everything, including their kids’ Christmas toys, in a shack fire at Kosovo squatter camp, Samora Machel in Cape Town on Thursday. Fifteen shacks were destroyed and about 60 people are homeless. Sipho Myeki (40) said the fire started at his neighbour’s shack when no one was home.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuOYwFThKwVhGezYDZBBaRmebfaWN8AAc5wRwKaVdRcZqm_oeWK-j4MUCIs5rE5nsflnr4nlAlYkAX4kZVHMk-LxhxSoyu8TZe_moE2G9S-6_ROp0nmr2u2RxZwtWxlvCrF6fwTlv94EC3OzmMOSEBycSPTSi56VacoxwV8-SC2jc-g3nZr7kGx8DCtM9unyUshkQ5zDrNKfdRz-wpA19f4C9QDAomUd4qo-iApwPipnQjBemIP5MrUXvvSqP5dNqPnz4FomO1gOnZzI79r5zxJxdeE_bM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGqb0tGsyDtVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I heard a noise and thought it was a helicopter but then I smelt smoke. “When I looked out the window I saw smoke from my neighbour’s house. I went out and immediately spread the alarm.“Why did it start now with Christmas just around the corner? This fire happened so fast.”Some residents speculated that the fire was caused by an electricity box in the shack. They said it was strange that the fire broke out so long after the owner had gone.Zusakhe Mbiyo (32) said: “I just returned from the Eastern Cape this morning to find my shack burned down. I am tired and I lost everything I left behind in my shack. However, we are grateful no one was injured.” When Daily Sun arrived at the scene, kids were in tears because they’d lost their Christmas toys, new clothes and school uniforms.Onela Maphaza (7) said: “I am hurt. My mother just bought me a new bicycle because I studied hard during the year and got nice results. Now the bicycle she bought is gone.”Community leader Cebisile Bathathu said the ward councillor and disaster management had been informed and an official from disaster management was already making assessments.Fire and Rescue Service spokesman Theo Layne said: “Fifteen wood and iron structures were completely destroyed by the fire. Sixty people were displaced. No injuries were reported.”His explanation for the cause of the fire was different from that of the residents. “The probable cause,” he said, “was a lit candle overturning and igniting surrounding combustible material.”
