MADALA Anthony Dambara was travelling with his cat in his car on Sunday when a hijacker pointed a gun at him and pushed him out of the vehicle.  But Captain the cat was still in the car as the thug drove off, which ended up costing the hijacker his life. The brave cat jumped on the hijacker’s head and started scratching him, and when the thug tried to shoot the animal he ended up killing himself! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst8bK6edDHiaKw6YG4Li7U2z0x6XaeRxqX8bw6ifi-xWAoGGN-wBMbl2A4VFOnufcJbdh6CThmr-zX4kJr44zq9iNKES5vF4XUP-wyY5feggKtX07nXGnVD13Q4VwF60XThpwZWQRqYhNmq8X3XYJ1inh5EKJFJ2-MIEyUVAbE7nereU0RqNTARE8Ie88Dp3hBBE1A-LVe8wupK8VElmze5sQSfOKP3QnZ-7qEVk6nUPMX-cSFfbXnCBA6eWFwTu16UVzlqYpq5Z08IkwTKpWrks0FuZpU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEVAFE4mDZ6lEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When cops arrived on the scene later that day, they found the hijacker’s body in the car but Captain was unharmed.The 60-year-old madala was overjoyed to be reunited with his furry friend, but he had to wait until yesterday to get his car back after police impounded it.Police spokesman Captain Richard Monyai said the madala was driving his Opel Kadett in Bertrams, Joburg, when the hijacker approached him and fired three shots into the air. Anthony refused to get out of the car but the hijacker pushed him out of the vehicle and sped off.Cases of hijacking and attempted murder and an inquest docket were opened. Madala Anthony said he still couldn’t believe that Captain killed the hijacker and he got his car back. “I never thought he would stand up to that thug. He deserves a big Christmas present,” he said.Anthony said he named the cat Captain because he has been brave ever since he was a kitten.
