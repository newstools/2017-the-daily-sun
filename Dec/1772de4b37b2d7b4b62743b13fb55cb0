Those charges had been earlier crafted by Ziyambi, Mutsvangwa said. Mugabe then resigned, and the impeachment was called off. Mutsvangwa was an outspoken critic of Mugabe and his wife Grace long before the November 15 military operation that ended the Mugabe's control of the party. But last week the presidential adviser stirred controversy for allegedly telling supporters that the army would help Zanu-PF campaign in next year’s elections, according to Daily News.Mutsvangwa later said he was misquoted.Mutsvangwa and his wife are considered one of several “power couples” within the newly-configured leadership of Zanu-PF. Others include Mnangagwa and his wife Auxillia, who is an MP, and Ziyambi and his wife Florence, who is the deputy prosecutor general.Some readers have criticised Mutsvangwa for being “a political vuvuzela”.Commented one reader in response to Mutsvangwa's latest claim: “You are wrong on blowing your wife’s trumpet… be humble sir. Advisers do their talking behind closed doors… thanks.”http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/my-wife-played-key-role-in-toppling-old-mugabe-claims-zim-leaders-adviser-20171222
