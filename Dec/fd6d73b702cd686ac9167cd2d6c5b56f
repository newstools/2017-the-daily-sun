    JOHANNA Ngwenya has been waiting for four long years to move into her RDP.  A new two-bedroom house was handed over to her years ago, but it has been standing empty because it has no electricity, water or doors inside. The 83-year-old gogo from Snake Park, Soweto told Daily Sun her only wish was not to die before she saw her grandchildren in the house. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssO4bknh4cyD5rF1SoORrZr7hgze1X1pUEStz8PI16O_W9IVfLLswauW-bYG-CaJtm0ToCTjg6rzVfnoyk1GsVGT3Qr8qL6pdA-ydxguItjGh2Zb194yuPX_NBIn2eJG8I9NnYkNvRJbIHXvHmvKtn0oXc_b67bS3gProWdPsYLxaHUYhvE_SAOFFK9jmdkgi_NQLJBIEM7Kri6_dW6GEjT-RabrZ2jFMxNG4BAo0e3rOeNYKAncqcTastU6WEDZRKqzoKHTRk7FaxQRepjLTXvI2kYLR8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGoCT4PZOnpPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I’m tired of waiting. The other houses were finished a long time ago but mine was left bare. I have no toilet, kitchen sink or electricity. How can I live there?” Gogo Johanna said she couldn’t afford to fix the house herself and she was scared thugs would vandalise it. “How can I be grateful for a house full of darkness? “I’m heartbroken and angry as my dreams of moving into a new house have been put on hold.” She said she wanted her grandkids to visit her for the holidays but she couldn’t invite them because she didn’t have anywhere for them to stay. Keith Khoza of the Gauteng Human Settlements department said: “The delay is being caused by her refusal to move her shack, which is in the way of the sewer pipeline in the yard. “It has now been agreed her shack will be moved so pipes can be installed.“The house will be taken through a quality assurance process to ensure gogo moves into a habitable house.” He said water and electricity are available and will be connected once all the work is completed.
