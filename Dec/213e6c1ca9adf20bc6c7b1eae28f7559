They think I’m making a lot money but that’s not the case. I’m just trying to provide for my kids.”The creature was later killed and burned by members of the community.“We are a religious family. We hope God will give us strength so things can go back to normal.”Sangoma Dabulamanzi Sithole said: “I advise the family to call someone to do a thorough search to make sure no other creature or muthi was left behind.”SPCA inspector Mike Allen said: “Some animals are endangered and must be protected.“We urge people to call us so we can save such animals and give them new homes.”
