He never thought that one day he would be sitting and talking alone in a studio behind the mic.“We used to be told to read novels in the classroom, and I read in a radio news tone,” he said.He said his classmates laughed at him but he was advised that he could reach the sky if he continued using his voice as he did.“One day my teacher told me that my voice was radio material. I couldn’t believe it!” said Navigator, as he’s known by listeners.“Ever since I’ve worked on air, I realised that listeners are the most important people in my life. Without them, I am nothing.” He’s hoping to fly higher in the next couple of years.“Five years down the line, I would like to see myself owning a radio station that will take care of talented young people who are struggling to get a chance in the radio industry.” He said one needs a strong educational background to work in radio.“I completed my matric at Lebohang Secondary School in Boipatong, Gauteng.“I am currently studying journalism at the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism in Joburg, through distance learning.”
