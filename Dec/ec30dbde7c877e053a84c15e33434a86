    ANC members have given Cyril Ramaphosa an opportunity to capture the state in good faith.He should remember that he was elected on a ticket of those who are gatvol of corruption in government.His presidency gives hope to those in the ANC who still believe that their organisation can be saved from rampant corruption and be returned to its main purpose of serving Mzansi people. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu_m2W2NeMm4-bj9DvAmF5sTDahOIQ3CqxHJmu4MU4OU9a9wxWsgD5gY1y7APAKlmKPULKX68tyVCJp9VswEn9sqb7G1-SfqsukrqX5S6EdiZjPc0XFUbOjYUrG5YiMqmYVSMluEAOMeyCHlCnZKkk9m7rQb1MCwaY1NcgMHFFh0-boSoy5Lt2OP3cA1CuoD9HEikFy_0DR5ucgO3A47cF3zMaVt5BCss-wc1-N3FJ64DWIndFQtRXy8FkZis2WF-iBf5MeNeJ4gjgEI4SZ1fBFptogKpI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOqabX5qVPZpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Now it's up to Cyril to decide on what kind of legacy he would like to leave behind.If he is interested in having a clean government and attracts those voters who are gatvol of corruption, then there are a few individuals he must get rid of - and fast.To save what’s left of the country, let the axe immediately fall on all the Gupta drum majorettes in key government positions.The first person to be fired without even asking her to give reason why she should not be fired is Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini.She has been completely useless in that position.She has no legacy to leave behind and even if she could be allowed to continue in that position for the next 10 years, she would still leave no legacy, except for a trail of destruction.She has constantly been forced by the courts to do her job.The axe must also fall on Nomvula Mokonyane, firstly for saying she does not trust Cyril. No one works for people they don't trust. I also don't think any right thinking president would like to have minister who has the mentality of letting "the rand to fall so she can pick it up".After all, the Water and Sanitation department went bankrupt under her watch. The department was R4.3 billion in the red, earlier this year,  leaving hundreds of contractors unpaid. Internal controls, project management and contract management are also said to have collapsed. So fresh brains are needed there. The next fellow to be shown the door is Mosebenzi Zwane.This fellow appear to be too close to the Guptas, though he denies being captured. Release him so that he can have ample time to clear his name.Just like Zwane, Malusi Gigaba should also be given an opportunity to go clear his name. If you decide otherwise about him, then you just need to move him far away from the national purse. We can't have a minister who still experimenting in that position. Put back Nhlanhla Nene in that position because he was fired for no reason. Des van Rooyen has gone to ground lately. Find him and kick him back to the back benches of parliament.While at it, please search for Faith Muthambi, yes, the very same minister who presided over a big mess at the SABC.  She also belongs in the back benches of the national assembly. The likes of Lynne Brown has obviously lost control of some of the state owned enterprises - the rot at Eskom and Transnet is just a perfect example.  Show her the exit. Lastly, move David Mahlobo away from the energy department for obvious reasons. Tell him to go find a new hobby and stop playing around nuclear energy.
