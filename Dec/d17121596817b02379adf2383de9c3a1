    WHEN these Khoisan men left Port Elizabeth 35 days ago, they had one thing in mind.They wanted to meet President Jacob Zuma or his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, to hand over a memorandum of demands.Chief Khoisan SA, Christian Martin, Shane Plaatjies and Brendon Billings left Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape on 13 November.Following a long walk, they arrived in Tshwane and set up camp in the grounds of the Union Buildings on 30 November.They tried in vain to meet the president.They claimed they were turned away at reception because they were wearing animal skins.On Saturday, the four were ready to walk to Nasrec in Joburg, where the 54th ANC National Conference is taking place, in their bid to meet the president.But a Good Samaritan persuaded them not to walk and gave them a lift. They had fasted for 10 days by this time.Christian said they hoped to meet the president after he had addressed the conference.They tried to set up a meeting with him but failed.“It was chaotic and we did not know who to speak to. We were sent from pillar to post,” he said.He said after failing to meet the president, they returned to Tshwane to wait.The group wants the Khoisan to be recognised as the first nation of Mzansi. They want the 1913 land claims to be scrapped and for the Khoisan language to be given official status.Co-operative governance and traditional affairs spokesman Legadima Leso said the department’s statement on the matter issued last week still stands.“The four men’s actions are regrettable as there are better ways to solve their concerns.“Khoisan communities and leaders have never before been recognised in accordance with legislation but with the introduction of democracy there has been a move to change the situation,” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvZA1QHTQbyG_3HFZLW0yYpTv7ZdV-CfOHHed3gleVEwyO5W-4haf9DlNfb9JlEp2bbcVOYOcYMg6I3QYWLccGzaD4ygHVGTb7LS_3bRoZsqtrmnY5hqvQlsqObuauFpX3P1Ajg4Xtw3-jPFZwitOYw0ZxPF_0SzutLQI_F_lGyS0kpQjCWTz_YFiKc3kolBG2hlgMzA3ChdM_Pw6V753gGBenXLQmIyw4b4vabDBFxHaM7tnWpGD_bQzrc2_7XPU48s-kT0HQRCkAVdKCpmXlkX1cpFvw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNUA_GxybuzdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
