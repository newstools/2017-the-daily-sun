She was a shoulder to cry on for many of us and we were happy to have her back,” said Kabareng.“We’re still in shock and disbelief and pray her killer will rot in jail.”Tsholofelo will be buried in Madikwe, near Zeerust in North West, on Sunday.Her murder has angered many South Africans, some of whom have called for the death penalty to be brought back.Lerato Sethusa wrote on Twitter: “South African men suffer from an inferiority complex. They are insecure and want to control their women.”Krugersdorp police spokesman Constable Lucky Matome confirmed that a suspect was arrested and said he was expected to appear in the Krugersdorp Magistrates Court soon.Tarlton station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Christina Tsoaedi said she was concerned about the number of murders that had taken place between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.
