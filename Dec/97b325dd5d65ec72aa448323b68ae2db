Luckily, firefighters were able to prevent the blaze from causing more severe damage to the businesses surrounding the pharmacy. “No one was in the building when the fire broke out.”Balram said the cause of the fire had not yet been established.An employee at the pharmacy said: “At the moment we do not know what caused the fire and cannot estimate how much damage has been done. “We are still waiting for an investigation to be conducted so we can figure out what caused the fire.“We are shocked because we were not there when the incident happened.”The SunTeam’s attempts to get hold of the building’s management were unsuccessful. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said no case had yet been opened.
