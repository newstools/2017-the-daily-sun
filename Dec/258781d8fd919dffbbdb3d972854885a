Death has robbed us of a great leader.”IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala, reading a letter written by party leader Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said: “I hoped there was going to be a time when all the leaders from the factions would come together and unite.”Reverend Mthembeni Mpanza of the Nazareth Church of God in Pinetown urged all factions to remember they are children of one prophet, Isaiah Shembe. Reverend Gqinsa Mbatha of Thembezinhle said Vela had told him he wouldn’t want his successor to be announced on the day of his funeral. None of the Ebuhleni faction members were at the funeral. Spokesman Thokozani Mncwabe said Mduduzi couldn’t attend as church custom didn’t allow it.
