    A DISAPPOINTED Small Business Development Minister and
senior ANC member Lindiwe Zulu said women must go back to the trenches to
ensure greater representation in the ANC's leadership structures.Yesterday evening, Jessie Duarte was announced as the
only woman among the ANC's top leadership, retaining the position of deputy
secretary general.Speaking to the media at the Nasrec Expo Centre today,
Zulu said the election results were a sign of regression as the previous top
six had two women - Duarte and Baleka Mbete as national chairperson.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvi9hpx-ZA1i3TSXYVIUAfSfyd4vXGJeWTg2z8E4mIyaBirHtZGXv2u9-uwj3D4nFl02G44VnGMDjvG4bdIQlj4dsfXzDfxZBxns-LYOi3guvoakQrkOLicTRkN0FjOcgXeqo0HSgLqSihgdzjEAEZskLnXG8HxTb1vRG1-xrZeneAdiQV4HBLI262A7q7EM-oR3JnhP15agduX2BzCff71OlWgqSz8RKXP3mQc1iFAmBKmeBktt_E-1I9hv4JLI2ia9Yrf2qdsSfARAMvao1jsUFEAI9E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLFouj0B0mQBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

women to see where it is we didn't go right to ensure that we got more
women," Zulu said."The main reason why we keep pushing for women is
that we believe as women we have the capacity and capability to be in a
leadership position of the ANC.  "But at this conference, obviously the branches have
spoken, we have to respect that. We'll go back and see what else we can do. How
do we move forward in ensuring that in the future we have women?"She added: "By the way, I also don't want us to make
as if women are always on their own. There are men who are also very concerned
about women not being in key decision-making structures."Those men who are in agreement with us, it means as
women we need to talk to them, because in the end, we need to understand that
having women in key decision-making structures in the African National Congress
will also reflect itself in society in general."At a press conference today, Bathabile Dlamini also took
aim at the ANC and patriarchy in society more generally, saying: “This is an
attack on women struggles. We have been dealt a blow and want to call on all
women to stand together.”https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/women-must-go-back-to-trenches-for-leadership-positions-lindiwe-zulu-20171219
