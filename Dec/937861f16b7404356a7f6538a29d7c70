Those defeats resulted in the sacking of coach Thierry Mulonzo and his assistant Les Grobler. The club then appointed Owen Da Gama, who roped in Freese as his assistant in October. That seems to be the best move they made the entire season. The club has not tasted defeat in any of Da Gama’s eight games in charge. They lead the pack with 29 points, four ahead of second-placed Jomo Cosmos. Highlands’ star midfielder Mothobi Mvala, who has scored five goals this season, says the return of Namibian Peter Shalulile, who spent the whole of 2015-16 nursing an ankle injury, has also been a huge boost. Next up, Highlands meet Real Kings in a Nedbank Cup qualifier at Makhulong Stadium on Wednesday (3pm).“Highlands are not a one-man team but the presence of Peter completes the puzzle. He is one of the best players in our team,” said Mvala. “I’m happy with the hard work we have put in so far. Obviously the main goal is to make a return to the top flight. And at the rate we are going, it’s possible. “What makes me happy is that everyone can score. We do not only rely on strikers for goals.”
