I still feel some pain and I can’t do hard labour.“I don’t even have a wife or kids to look after me.” Sekgopo said that he applied for an RDP three times since 2003, but had no success.“Instead, I was given a toilet. I’m just surprised that my neighbours got RDPs but I was left out. “I’ve now lost hope and I don’t think I will ever live a decent life.” He said his house has fallen over on him three times after heavy rain storms and he was injured. “Whenever heavy rain destroys my house, I’m forced to rebuild it because I don’t have anywhere else to go. I was in the process of recovering from the stroke and the mud house has put me back at square one.“I don’t know what to do anymore.”Sekgopo said he depends on his neighbours for food.Paena Galane, a spokesman for the human settlements department, said Sekgopo should submit his particulars to his ward councillor. “We also have community development workers who will assist him,” Galane said.
