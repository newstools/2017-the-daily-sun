    CAPE Town City defender Thamsanqa Mkhize says lapses in concentration have been their biggest downfall in recent matches. City have now gone four matches in a row without a win. They drew three of those fixtures and lost one. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsschrGl2sxZag3JIGOADPHm19NZkP7fRepRnU86kk85zWHjKdwoc-QuAdGBjLWEjOHgt-BgYYMGFVs8yTNJmbIWj9_wGwfWD587MsCG9c8gs7_yvph0jJGeq-W5Bhct_PqkDWJBMwEUj0OZwv2-_OxDm1fqjEFuCrfs3qsT3y3NZ_5-yZ5ER7By359SwMPKLM0E6S8qhEHfIvZ9Au9UNd6V1Zn3c9BiK4E4yH-Pai7SS8rXCCAyu_R6sQctP-VOcuDB85yTw26vKuC-wZarpslDLw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFL6qicNYKWmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It has happened a lot in recent matches – and it happens at crucial stages.”The Bafana Bafana full-back said they had worked hard on the problem – especially after their last match which they drew 1-1 with SuperSport United. Matsatsantsa a Pitori equalised in stoppage time to grab a point. Mkhize added that their chance to see whether they had succeeded in solving their problem would come tonight in their Absa Premiership match against AmaZulu at Cape Town Stadium (8pm).He said: “You can’t really tell whether you have solved the problem without testing yourself in a match. In training everything looks good but the AmaZulu match will give us a better indication. This is a big game for us.”The Durban-born player admitted, however, that Usuthu are a closed book to them. They expect a competitive match. “Judging by their log standing they have been doing well and are not to be taken lightly. They have shown more than once that they are a good team – against big teams like Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates. They did not lose to any of them – and even beat Sundowns. “This will be a tough match for us. Having said that we need to win it at all costs,” said Mkhize.
