    QUINTON Fortune’s appointment has been shrouded in controversy and now he could be on his way out of Bafana Bafana.The feeling among the football public has invariably been that Fortune was parachuted into the position of an assistant Bafana coach on the basis of his legendary status and not on merit.Stuart Baxter had always maintained the appointment was not yet permanent, but said he would recommend Fortune for the position on a long-term basis.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu6U26T0wt6lDJAwepGLJ1areYclKcq0xLCfifoSYl8UdiNtjbuKrLPkN-Hr2e4OBL4lOUGN9n4NwHdBtTOl0Jt-YN57YkV_bt02ui83-YBKGCdu8oKBlwKIwU622a8bgWTyOpOuwG31iYVkbsjhlO5PEYRp1VWQ-3UgHAluRIvU2tbroigBM4BWHH5fKZZ9OxeNqXBpGVPCDdOa-U1VVSvDKU3jaOCZJwEof1Vwpo0fW5B_lZ-uJxv17uxVuiEtNhTuVqAGCV0P0JALPmk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDclCMvXXUoJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
