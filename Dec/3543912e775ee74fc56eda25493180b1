nominated "unity" to be declared "null and void, unlawful and
unconstitutional".News24 recently reported that sources in Mpumalanga said
that provincial chairperson David Mabuza had instructed branches to write
"Unity" next to candidates on the nomination forms.However, these votes were recorded as abstentions by the
electoral commission. Every time the officials mentioned the number of
abstentions, delegates shouted "Unity". Mabuza demanded that they change it from abstention to
"Unity", however the commission officials refused.There were 223 abstentions for the position of presidency,
more than the presidential frontrunners - Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa
(117) and Dlamini-Zuma (123).
