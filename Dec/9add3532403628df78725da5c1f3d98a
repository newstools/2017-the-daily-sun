    Distell, South Africa's leading producer and marketer of award- winning alcoholic brands such as Nederburg, Amarula, Savanna, Hunters and JC Le Roux has teamed up with the leading national “drive-you and your-car” home service, Good Fellas, to help motorists get home safely.This powerful collaboration that launched on Friday, 24 November, and running until 12 January 2018, is a national road safety initiative which gives motorists an alternate way of getting home after a drink and is intended to steer people away from driving while under the influence of alcohol. Aptly named, Get Home Safely (#GHS), any motorist can hitch a ride with Good Fellas as often as necessary, taking advantage of both free and discounted fares.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1180455287&t=artid%3dcce7370d-3364-4d28-a2e2-34e8835b6071%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1180455287&t=artid%3dcce7370d-3364-4d28-a2e2-34e8835b6071%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>Good Fellas is offering discounts on all their membership packages, whereby they are waiving the first month’s fees, offering certain kilometres free and discounted rates for non-members, when booking on the Good Fellas App using the GHS promotional code. Motorists can choose to make use of the non-membership service, which provides a free first ride for up to 10km and 10% discount for rides after that. Membership packages include pay-as-you-go, discounted 25km, discounted 45km and discounted 95km, which all qualify for your first month’s subscription for FREE. Should the members use all the FREE kilometers in the package, the rate per km will apply. Over the 6-week period of the campaign, motorists can make substantial savings.“Partnering with Good Fellas reinforces our commitment towards encouraging responsible drinking and we are reaffirming this by offering motorists incentives to be safe on the roads. We firmly believe this initiative will result in behavioural shifts on our roads, particularly during the festive period,” explained Bridgitte Backman, Distell's corporate and regulatory affairs director.Backman said Distell was investing in an extensive media campaign to promote responsible drinking and raise awareness on the dangers of drinking and driving.“Good Fellas is proudly partnering with Distell, a company that has lead the way in their industry with regards to getting their staff home safely and responsibly with Good Fellas for the past 6 years,” says Alison Brussow, Good Fellas Head of Marketing, Sales, Customer and Public Relations. “Our collaboration is a powerful synergy of leading brands to bring South Africans the smart way home! There is no longer any excuse for South Africans to drink and drive. Good Fellas recognises the need for you and your car to get home safely. Good Fellas strives continuously to bring a reliable, affordable and trusted service to our member customers as well as our non-member customers. The #GHS collaboration is the way forward,” she continued.  To take advantage of the promotion this festive season, motorists can download the Good Fellas app and use the code GHS to book their rides or alternatively call into the call-centre on 086 143 3552 with the code.This promotion is available on the national Good Fellas footprint, which covers all the major metropoles, as well George and Nelspruit.We encourage motorists to follow Distell on social media and share their stories using the hashtag #GHS to promote drinking responsibly this festive season and be part of the change. Twitter @Distellgroup	Facebook Distell Group
