They said kasi church members and a sangoma had visited their home, but they had no success in chasing away the evil spirit. Madala Tebello said the terror started two weeks ago while he was resting under a tree. “There was no wind but the leaves suddenly started shaking and fell on me.” Madala said he rushed into the house to tell his wife what had happened and while they were talking, the creature poured a bucket of water on them.“The evil creature also threw potatoes at us. I have no idea why the tokoloshe is doing this to us.” Gogo Makgotso said at night, the creature banged doors and pots and threw stones on to the roof. “We are unable to sleep or eat. We are pleading for help to get rid of this monster,” she said. Madala said they had consulted a sangoma, a prophet, two spiritual healers and church members, but they couldn’t help them. “They all told us we were being tortured by an aggressive male tokoloshe, but no one has been able to get rid of it,” he said. The SunTeam spoke to sangoma Mampho Moreki, who said someone who wanted revenge had sent the tokoloshe. “The only way the family can get rid of the evil creature is by performing a ritual and slaughtering a cow,” she said.
