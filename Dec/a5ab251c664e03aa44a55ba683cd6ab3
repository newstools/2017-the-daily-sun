Mpho is now faced with the challenge of getting her remains. “For the past two years I’ve been unable to locate her grave. No one knows where she is buried,” she said. Mpho said after Dimakatso left home in 2007, she heard rumours that she was living on the streets. In 2015 she again visited mortuaries, including the government mortuary in Bloemfontein. She said: “I was given the mortuary’s album, where I found a picture of my daughter who had been brutally murdered. “The mortuary performed DNA tests, which proved she was my daughter. But she had long been buried as a pauper.” Free State Health spokesman Mondli Mvambi confirmed that Dimakatso was given a pauper’s funeral. He advised the family to approach the government mortuary and ask for the undertaker that organised her burial to find the tomb number and site. “Once all the procedures have been followed, we’ll approach the environmental health services to arrange for the exhumation. “It’s also important for the family to go to the mortuary for purposes of positive identification.”
