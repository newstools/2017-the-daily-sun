I also sell aprons and peg bags. “But my denim bags fly off the shelves because they are bought by people in Limpopo and Gauteng.”Philemon said he can’t imagine doing anything else for a living.The father of two said he uses the profit he makes to look after his children in QwaQwa.“My children are still in school. I only see them during school holidays, but I always send money home so they can have everything they need,” he said.It was not easy being away from his children, but he had to go to another province to give them a better life.“My dream is to own a building where I’ll make more bags,” said Philemon. “That would also create job opportunities for unemployed people in my kasi.”
