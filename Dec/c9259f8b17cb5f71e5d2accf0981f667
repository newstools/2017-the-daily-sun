EKURHULENI mayor Mzwandile Masina says he will work with new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa.Masina made headlines in October when he declared that he would resign if Ramaphosa won the ANC’s December elections.“ I can never serve under Cyril. I respect him as my older brother, as a leader but just don’t believe in this group he belongs to. So he can lead. I will be out,” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuMdwYaKkrnEyWY9FuI3oettITGmkQhLdYlSRaKHFZDcoBY1gHPxqVjGmto3NAItgdV7VBkKATNhKZdlJstwY8YrzqCxzUzlpRKSxrW3DP5bq8CJpt0avWMMWCXEsvJX39hMPVUlhReeDZ7fWVEXSvkbboELk1N4-9mhJY_J7ihcOVxnBzxMkjqEeP8VMarS1VTzMQa-o2-H_43FI0KOzPHro9UQB1LMhrDFX9OfZrPKnuREvS4Cj-FkHwYBDecD_zVHoQ3I7zNqeeLNTng6i2YnDBpiio\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLZ-wqb2kvcmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I have worked very closely with Ramaphosa and will continue to work with him.” He said his comments had been taken out of context while he was responding to a question under pressure from Ramaphosa supporters to call for a vote of no confidence in his leadership. “I responded that, if that is the case, I am prepared to make their job easier by resigning while remaining an ordinary member of the ANC and a councillor.”Masina said he had chosen to support Nkosazana because of her position on radical economic transformation.“The only person articulating the outcome of the policy conference was her.“But I believe that Comrade Ramaphosa, as a disciplined leader, can implement those policies of the ANC as resolved by conference.”He would not comment on his first threat to resign, saying he had put that to bed on 1 November.Meanwhile, he said, the party should resist moves to take the outcome of its top six vote to court.“We are calling upon all delegates to accept the outcome as announced and desist from using the courts to deal with internal democratic processes of the ANC,” he said. – NEWS24
