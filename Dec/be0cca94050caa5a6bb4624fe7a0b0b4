People saw Bongiwe lying on the ground. They said she was still alive but was very weak.“They called an ambulance but the paramedics said she was already dead.“Nobody knew where she was at that time but as we were searching for her, we heard that an unknown body had been collected in Benoni.“We called the police and they confirmed that a body had been found. “We went there and were shocked to find it was Bongiwe.”The family said Bongiwe was a hard worker and looked after her daughter.“We want answers. Her friend told us that Bongiwe left her place but she doesn’t know what happened to her afterwards. We are praying hard.
