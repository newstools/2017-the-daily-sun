Her love of her craft shows on stage. “My Memories and Empty Spacesrole changed three times, from the gogo who knows what is going on in her village, to a farmer and gobela.”Nomathamsanqa said the gogo character was respected for her understanding of Xhosa culture, as well as for being a farmer and traditional healer.“She said it taught her that people without knowledge of their history and culture are like trees without roots. “I encourage everyone to know where they come from.” She was a midwife in the soapie Greed and Desire and in e.tv’s Z’bondiwe as Roxanne and Esihle’s mum.Now she is playing Reverend Mamthobi in Rhythm City.
