She must also be a good person. “In return, I will reward her with lots of love.” He survives on his pension grant. He divorced his ex-wife in 2001, and they have four kids who are now grown up. “I’ve been lonely for many years,” said madala Tsimane. “I’ve not had a partner for 16 years, and I think it’s time to start looking for a real woman. “I hope the People’s Paper will help me find the woman of my dreams, who will be with me till death do us part. “I’m not looking for someone who’s taking chances or is married. I need a woman who will take good care of me.”
