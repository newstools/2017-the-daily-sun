A passer-by found the child and alerted the police, who rushed her to hospital. The mum told Daily Sun her daughter was abducted by unknown men driving a black VW Golf while she was playing with her friend. She said her nightmare began when the girl’s sister phoned her at work saying the child had disappeared. The mum rushed home and was told by her daughter’s friends that she had been taken by men who claimed they were her friends and were taking her to buy Christmas clothes. The mum was beginning to lose hope when she received a call from the police telling her that her little girl had been found. “She was taken to hospital. “When we arrived there we found she had been stabbed in the neck, exposing her windpipe. Luckily she was not raped,” said the mum. She said although she was relieved her daughter was found, she would only feel safe once the suspects were caught. Mamelodi police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said a case of abduction was opened. No arrests have been made.
