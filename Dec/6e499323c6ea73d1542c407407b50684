These kids show their breasts to express themselves and show they are proud.”Head of TV Yabantu Lazi Dlamini said social media insults culture and women by sexualising children. “They should respect our values and dignity.”Dlamini said if Google keeps showing them disrespect, they will act. “We will remove them.” Ntshitshi Zinhle Sibaya (16) said: “We will not stop because Westerners say we must.”On Tuesday, amatshitshi went to Google’s offices to deliver a memorandum but were refused entry.Google SA spokeswoman Mich Atagana said no TV Yabantu videos on its YouTube channel were blocked. “We allow for suitable cultural nudity. Where videos have been incorrectly age-restricted, restrictions are removed once the content is reviewed. “We do not allow video advertising on any channel containing bare breasts or genitalia,” said Atagana.WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
