We don’t have a lot of time on our hands, as we kick off the second round less than a month from now. The boys have shown some cracks in defence in matches of high intensity. We need to sign two defenders to ensure we return stronger.”The year 2017 has been a roller-coaster for Bakgaga. They survived relegation via the play-offs in June to be in the top three after 15 rounds of matches in the Absa Premiership.The Ga-Mphahlele outfit recently received a R1,5 million cheque for winning their first ever Premiership Quarter One (Q1) Innovation.Thobejane said: “When we come back from the Christmas holidays we will be aiming for Q3. Winning Q1 was a huge boost for us, it restored players’ confidence after two heavy defeats. It has made them believe that we can win the league this season.”
