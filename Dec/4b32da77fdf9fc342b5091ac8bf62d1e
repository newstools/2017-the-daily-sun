    SHE still thanks her lucky stars that she was sitting outside her house the day when the roof and bricks tumbled down.If it were any later, she would have been killed in bed.When asked why it all happened, Emily Seema pointed her finger straight at the local mine.The 77-year-old gogo from Ga-Seema Village in Mapela, outside Mokopane, said the house developed cracks every time the mine did underground blasting.She said her house collapsed three weeks ago as she was sitting outside.She rushed inside and found bricks on top of her bed.The gogo blamed Anglo Platinum’s Mogalakwena Mine.She said the people at the mine knew about the cracks in their houses caused by their blasting, and in 2008 brought a contractor in to repair cracked homes at their village.“I knew one day my house would fall in because every time they blast underground, cracks develop on the walls.“My heart is sore. I’m a pensioner surviving on a social grant. Getting my house fixed is an impossible mission.“I am left with only two children and a granddaughter and cannot rely on them because the one is mentally ill, while my son has a family and survives on piece jobs,” sobbed the gogo.Emily said she had bought cement to repair the cracks but now a big part of the house has collapsed before she could fix anything.Spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said the mine has not received a report from Emily since the incident.“We will send a team from the mine to her house to see what really happened and take it from there,” she said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssi7I3B0y7Byiccckm6DfHRoPHQ-oEB_jOW2ya5N6Tk0_D2rRcWuN57GUKxS0JOB-R6efhya2Bg2zcrF2mouckCG7EB7HkVMjjverkZs2lGUpN3UWJFKlSPSkpsxXjLyOUNUhn4HTK5T-U9WHVDh67-0pHcijVjBzSt6kDMrdi1drdz8WYsgABAilWrB7KRbmbw2Rzns-SHxaU33WELiNsHF8pSXRoF0pBs4jqxMOtXQTH8CFse0g-FYSWOh4Qz7CyIRdzzOJwbi0XvS8xHR7pdxGd4wAw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB7m5MXM5W_dEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
