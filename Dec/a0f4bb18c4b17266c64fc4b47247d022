His aunt said she found him in a family rondavel with the child’s body parts scattered around the floor. In September doctors at Fort England Psychiatric Hospital in Grahamstown found that he was mentally unfit as a result of abusing dagga. Meanwhile, brothers Mawethu (22) and Luvo Gwayi (26) will be back in court on 17 December, when Luvo’s observation report is due to be presented to the Tina Falls Periodical Court in Qumbu. They also appeared yesterday, but their case was postponed for the results to be released. They killed their nine-year-old brother, Buhle, in an attempt to cure Luvo’s epilepsy by eating and cooking his body parts.
