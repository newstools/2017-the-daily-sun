    Dear MizzB  I’m a 24-year-old man whose father died when I was young.  I became the breadwinner even though I was the youngest of my siblings.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss232U27p7mc9IRy49DH4q2F0zOtqjBkDFqe6OGU6PSVuixzcS8lpBM59jIHKNZuohd_9lQQCR-j3tPjE4VdMrrvgi5r5WdgniEB3L2pEI77n4YC0wWBCPtw_csKJCL02Ri6BH3zEgssU8wMkV2bJKG9TxdoCi-9Se8bC2sHhADvQXsJW5-riKAx2ALSJh1FjbiEFkC3Mu6foz8X36wQNUQoAnzDA6lW8qpFJwMD5VqjMoL_mExv0ZwtI7mBoqIR3kcD6FtGfPc6hIBxcuNqlISSWhF6ds\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDiNuXqt09wGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I lose my temper easily. I hurt the women I love, including my mother.- AnonymousDear AnonymousYou’re not your father! It’s great you took responsibility to help in the household but this resulted in you neglecting your childhood. Your anger is the inner child trying to take back its power. When you’re angry you’re in defence mode and this doesn’t allow those around you to love and support you. It’s not your fault your dad died. Stop punishing yourself and those around you. Become your own man and take control of your emotions. Let’s talk on 083 323 1023 or email mizzb@lovelife.org.za
