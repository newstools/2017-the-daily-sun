We know he has been doing well and when a player is doing well some teams become interested in them. But Ramagalela is a City player and he is staying – no matter what.” Ramagalela’s form has caused a debate among football lovers, as many believe he deserves to play for Bafana Bafana. The Venda-born player proved his worth when he won PSL Goal of the Month and Player of the Month for October. Meanwhile, Molekwa is not happy with his team’s overall performance in the first round of the Absa Premiership.The 40-year-old said his team did not achieve the target they set earlier this year.“Our goal was to collect more than 20 points in the first round and we have not done that,” he said. “If you set a goal and don’t achieve it, you get disappointed. “But I cannot blame anyone, the players did all they could. It was not meant to be. The boys are not happy about our failure to achieve our goal either.”The coach promised that they would make up for it in the second round next year.“We are aware that the second round of the PSL season is usually very difficult, but with the players we have – and maybe another one or two added in the January transfer window – we can achieve our goal,” he said. City are 13th in the league table with 15 points from 14 matches. Rise and Shine are tied with AmaZulu and struggling SuperSport United, who are both above them due to goal difference, along with Roger de Sa’s Platinum Stars, who are below them, third from bottom.
