He apparently lost control of his Kia on the busy Moshoeshoe Street. The incident, which led him to a police cell, happened a week after the Buccaneers ditched him. Residents said he narrowly missed children as his car flew into the air before smashing into a Ford and the wall. They claimed the 27-year-old was very drunk and cans of booze were recovered from his car. In photos taken at the scene, Rakhale looks dazed. Rakhale was in the news recently after Orlando Pirates permanently sent him to Chippa United in Eastern Cape in a swap deal. Motlogelwa Arie, owner of the Ford Focus, said he was lucky to survive: “I was coming out of my yard when he came speeding and crashed into my car and the neighbour’s house. He was stuttering when we tried to find out what had happened,” he said. Rakhale promised to fix his car. “I told him I would take the legal route as my insurance would fix the car and I hoped the law would deal with him,” he said. Home owner Mathapelo Morathane said she did not want to spend the rest of the festive season in a house with a ruined yard. “His friend and mum came to my house and said they would fix my wall. I told them I want it fixed before tomorrow or I will go to the police.” Daily Sun tried to contact Rakhale with no success. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Simon Mofokatsana confirmed the star’s arrest for drunk driving and said he remained in custody.
