    The KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg has granted an application for leave to appeal by the provincial executive committee (PEC) of the ANC, led by chairperson Sihle Zikalala.However, Judge Rishi Seegobin effectively ruled that PEC would remain dissolved, as per the previous judgment, until the appeal was filed.This means that the PEC, which supports ANC presidential candidate Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, will lose its 27 voting rights allocated to each province for the ANC's national elective conference.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssjix2wXyv8B6Zd1Lh8GY1xaRhbJRASKT-YUvjjEkaWJx3RDe2-flHKZmMyStov6R2zUzYxWSqtFIT8GcodmY74Vd59VgtUxzczr2kj8BZYVoLcfcrokU0R4eAf4AnqO08xpfF0mOvjxSvi4ntK8-MbXhVM16sGSaBXnfMAEf-CR578LESL8FNbY3Sztx5LeMMXM69RpO8e1CDlkULlpIQcrWKwwavRJjbNh2CDnuhL8dDUQ4z-GlHhFO2xRY4u13gPFxny2fT3XGb0oLWfRYfnWtbCLeE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIpycqWja7DTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
