    FIRST class air travel on four foreign trips per year;
private houses and a small army of aides and domestic staff – these are some of
the benefits Robert Mugabe will enjoy after he was forced to resign last month.There will be no tightening of the belt for the
93-year-old jetsetter whose unpopular wife was known as Gucci Grace. Mugabe
gets a diplomatic passport and three vehicles, including a Mercedes limousine.There’ll also be a four-wheel drive station wagon and a
pick-up, which will be replaced every five years.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsslu5UeMxAyoMmtVzTdutUFC9u6ZDYqg2Do20naxlU0OHCuno2-D0dEt7hLI6Db_WygaA-vQsoFINodd_6ceU45WnUlyyndT4TBzAOS-gQrjA76QuEoteunG8u2PMlecFsNJauCmXJbfn3pZNlEvwpM9i44TcfVm19806HHA0Y3wkI0qIoqvccfi4R5bwEFxLc7MB6OGQ50VZ1Wpo-CAXqbY3BwqTYl7VFZ0oQmAHrGfmcpzXKYaRvj-QBjPbpFSbE5IstXTbXUWUYuTJkJnoaoMV1zwsdVUaZ3WA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKDRUM5pHhGBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

notice just published by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, reports the state-run Herald. And Grace certainly won’t be watering her vegetable
garden herself.The notice says: “There shall be employed in connection
with the residence of the former President (i) three domestic employees, and
(ii) two gardeners, and (iii) two cooks and two waiters and (iv) two laundry
persons.”“The ex-president will also get security staff, office
workers and aide de camp officers,” said the Herald.The regulations state that any president who has served
at least one full term since 1987 shall be eligible for the benefits. Mugabe, a
former prime minister, became executive president in 1987.Media watchdog, ZimMediaReview commented: “One day we’ll
have many former presidents :) It will be costly.” http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/waiters-cooks-four-international-trips-a-year-heres-what-mugabe-is-getting-after-37-years-in-power-20171228
