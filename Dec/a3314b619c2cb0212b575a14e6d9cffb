The moment I heard about the race I knew I had to register and take part. I’m looking forward to the race and just want to enjoy myself.” Local boy Seme, who is coached by his father, legendary athletics coach Michael Seme, is also looking forward to race day. Seme lives in Tshwane and said he would be doing himself an injustice if he didn’t take part. Seme, the training partner of long distance sensation Stephen Mokoka and road running queen Glenrose Xaba, is based at the High Performance Centre at Tuks. His best performance in 2017 was his fifth place finish at the Nelson Mandela Marathon in Pietermaritzburg in August when he clocked a time of 2:29:32 to become the highest placed South African in the top 10. Seme added: “It’s been a long year but taking part in this race would be an honour because of the name associated with the event.”
