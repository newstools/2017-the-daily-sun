He claimed Cassper got upset and told his team to break Thulani’s camera. A statement sent to the SunTeam by Rawbust said they had managed to retrieve a clip of the incident, and last week their lawyers sent a letter of demand to Cassper. The letter read: “Please note that due to your actions, our client has suffered extensive damages as that footage was to be sold to several broadcasting companies and was to be uploaded to Youtube. Your actions as mentioned above have resulted in our client suffering loss of income to the amount of R3 million.”Cassper couldn’t be reached as his phone went straight to voicemail, while his manager refused to comment.
