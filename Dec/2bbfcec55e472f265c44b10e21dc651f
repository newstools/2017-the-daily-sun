She was renting a room there. She was on her way back from fetching water from a water tank. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuuZhPW9NFrCvQAJaWDgzkr6mD_D0NFkSYtg-7VmS1dS2ia74ymswMJKOuTDpCuqzVHHemvemDr1gSRHswCF2mKA5xgE66Ew7mswUUkg6Ib-_GIw13aK6yORGYgoCbHTF0UO8QdIE6lbV0Bo7qs_IDHVCZDaDudflsmBXtNWEKj3v-wy4B06W_-XiAYgYlU3REmvdGCg8Qo_HJUInqAnrsZu8yqV9ZRl5VoU_xxx_I2ts-LO9Z-PZV79RsWQTecRNa5v7oWpKvBEHLpIANcyvqVyJetePI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDIaPpSWAEMsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We are told in the news that the rain water is making a huge difference in our dams, yet in KwaNdengezi we still don’t have a water supply.“People are forced to queue at water tankers near the road.” She said she was not in the area when the accident happened. “Witnesses said a speeding car crashed into her, squeezing her into the body of a tanker. “Her legs were severed and she died on the spot. “None of those involved in the accident have been to see the family – not the driver of the car nor the municipality. “We got the accident details from residents who were at the scene,” said Thokozani.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of culpable homicide had been opened. “Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” said Gwala.EThekwini spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “The water and sanitation unit is aware of the water supply issue affecting the area and is currently looking at solutions.”
