    FORMER Golden Arrows goalkeeper Ricardo Goss, who is now in the books of the National Division (NFD) outfit Real Kings, believes it’s time for him to move in order to grow as a player.The 23-year-old left Abafana Bes’thende at the beginning of the 2017/18 season after spending most of his youth career with the club.He joined Arrows’ development at age 15 and got promoted to the first team in January 2013, when Manqoba Mngqithi was still the coach. He was promoted with the likes of Siya Mngoma and Nkosingiphile Gumede, who’s now the number one keeper for Arrows.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuIdgXR4lf8501nXI1Bx-cjhROsSJndfKowWcpr9xIY_w7NTQrnQG-n2PFLjL8FKrPbihMt2AocuyVNQvkwCr0W6UUN3qUGZGo9gf1N0VPyQoTdsIzjK4TcWITkmNXMbDkwkTplUNeT0smIn0ZDiWi60QGxqoZrMUHjaoYLPQICU8SEUNzvSFD0wtGbq53OWSzjKENn6q-94MViHs_0LCs0a6_7logwgyLYHprLuUNthmcGkFhfdGm5RVSGJRPf3EHQyXUt-mAiH1jfviKC\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMirR77mjTAOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

In 12 games that they have played this season the KwaZulu-Natal-born player has conceded only seven goals.Today his side, Kings, are up against Uthongathi in a KwaZulu-Natal derby at King Zawelithini Stadium (3.30pm).The outspoken shot stopper will be hoping to keep his fifth clean sheet in a row.“When Arrows were playing in this league (NFD), I used to play I know it is not easy because all the teams are fighting for one goal. This match will be one of the toughest game for us, I think it will be decided by a single goal.“Uthongathi knows how to defend and we have been also doing well, not conceding many goal. Getting another clean sheet will be a big motivation. The more you don’t concede you are increasing chances of winning the league if your team is winning.”In another NFD fixture today, Mbombela United host Mthatha Bucks KwaNyamazana Stadium in Nelspruit (3.30pm).
