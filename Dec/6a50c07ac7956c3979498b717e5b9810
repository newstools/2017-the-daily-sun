It has also asked Treasury to withhold grant funding that is to be paid to these municipalities.Rakgoale admitted that Mopani had been owing the department for a long time. She said they had been servicing the debt at R20 million a month over the past two years. “It’s historic debt that had accumulated,” said the mayor.“The department is giving us water in such a way that it becomes difficult for us to bill our residents.”She said they needed to sit down with the department to discuss challenges.“The solution to this problem must come from both of us,” said Rakgoale.“We are currently not getting water for 24 hours. “Residents struggle to get water from us and we’re unable to bill them. “Nobody will agree to be billed for water that is not consistently provided. “We have no issue with paying the debt, but we are struggling to generate revenue from our consumers as they struggle to get water.” Vhembe district spokesman Matodzi Ralushai said they had already registered a dispute with the department over the amount. “We’ve been engaging with the department since July and will also meet them on Monday,” he told the People’s Paper. Ralushai said they were willing to pay, but the escalated amount was too much.
