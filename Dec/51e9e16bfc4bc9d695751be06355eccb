    FREE State Stars have restructured their technical staff, sacking goalkeeper coach Walter Khumalo.Khumalo was replaced by Tunisian Moured Selmi, who surprisingly joined Ea Lla Koto almost immediately after Khumalo was shown the door on Friday.Stars have been conceding goals within a few minutes after scoring in their last league games, prompting the changes. The club has conceded 12 goals in 11 league games so far and has scored the same number of goals. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzcbTO7R4CKQIFjd7oNFskHd08syimIOHrwZSjxNunDYyv4PHblddc1UPRe3ayb0OnILcHrZue72z5vEMli_E4BV7qzrhrRp8JfWJLmY0RJVZo_IxfEauZMAy7JPhchPmj5LOKJul-YtZDyvb87i-yOD3K2M_ONgc5CwbV3gZnNTu58-3w6Xq9AlTr-vAJSMacEdT7aEiF5Vi4hIzR95QkoF-mgEXnySxhwar3-ERadT8e6HZBPwbkwPl6DcpzRqt99mJB7KG1z4V8cug_\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzApLUfbWxH-BEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Ivory Coast shot-stopper also conceded in the last five minutes when they lost 1-0 to Cape Town City.Ea Lla Koto head coach Luc Eymael reiterated to SunSport that the goalkeeping department is a crucial part of the game, and that’s why they brought in the experienced Selmi.Said Eymael: “I had a good working relationship with Walter but this department is very sensitive. I worked with Selmi at Al-Merrikh in Sudan, he has goalkeeping badges from Tunisia and a Fifa Licence. I hope he will help our keepers improve.”Selmi is expected to guide Stars’ last line of defence when they host Golden Arrows in an Absa Premiership clash at Goble Park today (6pm). Eymael has injury worries to some key players ahead of the clash. “Manqele sustained broken ribs during the Chippa game. Vilakazi is doubtful as he twisted his knee against Chiefs. Our keeper Olivier (Kwizera) from Rwanda had surgery, while Rooi Mahamutsa got injured during a friendly match.” Despite the setback, Eymael is positive that Stars will overcome Abafana Be’sthende. The Belgian emphasised the importance of winning for motivation ahead of the Free State derby against Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium on Sunday. Stars are three points behind Arrows on 13 points.“Arrows are a good team, that’s why they had a good start to the season. They have a good tradition of attacking play, a tight defence with good strikers. I hope we collect points ahead of the derby.”
