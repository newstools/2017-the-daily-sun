He steals valuables including our cellphones,” she claimed. Gladys said she had taken Andrew to rehab centres without success. “Instead, he started trying out stronger drugs.“I’ve done everything including taking him back to his father in Rustenburg in 2015, but he came back,” said a heartbroken Gladys. She said Andrew left home and moved in with neighbours. “We moved elsewhere but that didn’t stop him from attacking us. One day he came here, took out a gun and shot at my windows.”She said she reported him to the police who advised her to take out a protection order against him. “It ended up being cancelled because he never signed it or bothered to appear in court. I don’t know what help to get him now,” she said.  Andrew told Daily Sun he has a problem with his mum.“There are things she’s doing I don’t like and she’s not aware of them,” he said, refusing to say what they were.Captain Stephen Maluleka said they will call Gladys to speak to her. “People in these situations should report it to social crime prevention co-ordinators at police stations.”
