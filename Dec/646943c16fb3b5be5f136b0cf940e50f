the suspect borrowed her son’s phone for half an hour, claiming she was being
watched and needed to call her husband.The body parts were in the bath and had clogged up the
drain, causing the flat to flood.Another neighbour named only as Tsui said she had heard
the sound of chopping coming from the flat for about 30 minutes on Sunday
morning. “I thought the noise was children playing with toys,”
Tsui said.She also smelled antiseptic coming from the flat, and
later noticed water flooding out from under the suspect’s door. On Monday,
forensic pathologists collected 11 bags of body parts, it was reported.Assistant District Commander Chung
Chi-ming is quoted as saying the woman had no previous record of mental
illness or domestic abuse. They would only be able to start their investigation
once her current condition had improved.
