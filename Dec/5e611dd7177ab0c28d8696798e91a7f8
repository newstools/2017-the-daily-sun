His aunt gave the unknown man the go ahead.”Women were also lambasted at the meeting for being disrespectful.“Women are not allowed near abakhwetha but AmaHlubi women recently invaded the initiates’ area. This act caused a lot of tension between AmaHlubi and AmaXhosa initiates in Walmer kasi. Luckily we managed to resolve the misunderstanding,” said Lonake.Amagqunukhwebe chief Bonisile Gqamane said: “Women have a role to play but they must stay away from circumcision affairs. They know very well that this subject is out of bounds.”
