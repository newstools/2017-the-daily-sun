    Outgoing ANC president Jacob Zuma gave his final speech for the party as he opened it's national elective conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg on Saturday. In a lengthy speech, Zuma slammed multiple groups and members he felt were actively working against the ANC, but said he did not bear grudges."You are my comrades. I have no ill feelings", he said. Zuma also proposed that the ANC's national elective conference decide on suitable sanctions for members who take the party to court.While some users on Twitter said they were moved by the president's speech, others didn't hold back in their criticisms.Here's what Twitter had to say about the speech:Watching #JacobZuma speak, I could see how he got where he is, stayed where he is, and why despite the critics, he has the support of so many #ANC54 #ANCConference2017if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvVWB0dLKctjhS6bo74Qimz1m4KKRvYHq2ENmChNHyYKzZqLqlqoWrSn1Eo_Upr7RvdF6KXvRzvOC4Ro1r1wKCRLXAN-FTfXotIcRrVyXMSOrXl3DjuP3DEYT8yoezRo2H_aUgJCrpsRrvsZKVnmgTHX-fir-2TpnaseQkelL2fnE5VQJxDBTkNCgMbJeIr3Lq7kPW5-kOiSWB0uRtXNGiHSXdstfo1A6FfIBIEJ_PdllU-3gNKEZkyBMSbNWdX7f-TtYrc-9bv3rx42ih90l4-AknCwAM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHqyphavk8xBEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This guy is just good at political chess..??????#ANCConference2017— Raophala_Mauwane (@RaophalaM) December 16, 2017According to this speech, everyone has contributed to the decline of the ANC and SA, except one President Jacob Zuma. #ANCConference2017 #ANC54— Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh (@SizweMpofuWalsh) December 16, 2017Mara JZ can talk hey.— Das Kapital?? (@iamDasKapital) December 16, 2017The old phrase of 'Planet Zuma' comes to mind following President Zuma's #ANC54 address. Seemingly delivered from an interstellar vacuum where core aspects of self-failure just don't exist. #ANCDecides #ANCElectiveConference— Daniel Silke (@DanielSilke) December 16, 2017Zuma speaks of Marikana as if he was some sort of neutral commentator not the head of the government responsible for the massacre.— Benjamin Glyn Fogel (@BenjaminFogel) December 16, 2017Waste of time to even try to critique Zuma's speech, so dishonest. Don't run to the court, when he's a serial litigant; don't do corruption, when he's corruption personified; tells his successor not to divide the anc, when under his leadership the ANC is divided like never before— Barney Mthombothi (@mthombothi) December 16, 2017THIS will be Pres. #Zuma my #SouthAfrica #Africa , forever in my heart. Awesome! ??????? https://t.co/rQBdGV9PGN— Minette (@MinetteJohnson) December 16, 2017I don’t hold Zuma in high regard, but I was a bit emotional when he sang knowing it might be the last time I hear that melodically voice— Lincoln (@makhasa123) December 16, 2017I haven’t seen Zuma dance like this in ages, so uninhibited. But also seems emotional. It has been a difficult tenure for him, possibly the most criticized of post-apartheid SA’s leaders. #ANCConference2017— Pumza Fihlani (@Pumza_Fihlani) December 16, 2017The main conclusion to draw from the political report of president Jacob Zuma is that he does not have respect for the boundary between fiction and reality. #ANC54— Eusebius McKaiser (@Eusebius) December 16, 2017Zuma: ‘People shouldn’t run to courts.’ Says the guy who has RUN TO COURT for 12 years to prevent charges, and ran to court with no case over Nkandla, state capture and a million ongoing appeals. #ANC54— Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh (@SizweMpofuWalsh) December 16, 2017The ANCYL did not give us free education. We gave ourselves free education. Zuma is talking populist horse shit now.— Jwarh' elihle (@Mfondiny) December 16, 2017NEWS24
