Grace Mugabe was awarded to protect her from standing trial for her alleged
assault.The DA’s application to have the immunity set aside will
be heard next year.A separate application was also made by the model and
AfriForum.International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite
Nkoana-Mashabane recognized Grace Mugabe’s diplomatic immunity.The DA maintains that the minister’s decision
“constituted an irrational abuse of statutory power and should be set aside as
unconstitutional.”Minister Nkoana-Mashabane had recognised that Grace
Mugabe qualified for spousal immunity under international law.At that time, the minister believed that not granting
Grace diplomatic immunity would have had negative impact on Mzansi’s relations
with Zimbabwe and also on the SADC Summit which Mzansi was hosting.
