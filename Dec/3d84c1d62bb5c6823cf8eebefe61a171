The Paarl born athlete says he is working hard in training preparing for next year. Bruintjies said: “You never know how ASA conduct their things. I don’t want to waste my energy worrying about whether I’ll make the team or not. “ASA have their way of doing things and I don’t want to focus on that. I’m done worrying about such things.”Bruintjies said it was the federation’s fault that he missed out on the World Championships.He said: “I did qualify for the world champs according to the IAAF qualifying standards, but not ASA standards.“But as I mentioned earlier, I don’t want to focus on small things that won’t get me anywhere.”The South African season will start a month earlier next year because of the Commonwealth Games in April, but Bruintjies said that won’t affect his training programme.Bruintjies added: “It’s good for me that the season starts early because I did not stop training and I’m in the best possible condition.“I’m happy and enjoying my training.”On his chances in Birmingham, Bruintjies said he was targeting a podium finish.He said: “ SA has not had podium finishes in the 100m for many years and I would be happy to change that.”
