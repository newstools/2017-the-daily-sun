    CONTROVERSIAL sprinter Henricho Bruintjies doesn’t want to set his hopes of qualifying for the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia next year, entirely on Athletics SA (ASA).Bizarre as it might sound, the former 100m record-holder may miss out on the Commonwealth Games even, if he meets the qualifying standards. as required for the athletes to qualify for the Games.History has taught him not to rely on ASA.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuM3mHGYfKEZjpN8f_R07_ARREOQN8swNmomH_GmEHsZR91oP9FxIxc3V1M2CZYDEnobO9ve_L8hiuly2hl3IdQjfB6mqb91TsYyWbIk1M2baJMIxWknTDvC7bPP2UOWPNM-6AhmKth_NpH6lK1Qef5isHUkhPPCsVRwbaB1Xw-4B7Z_dIu6PY6rcP79pThJL3yfHTwEBVucZHIFrJOMljW9BWRr5WFqK1iWqkUFNpDI2uYDDxIdaJVQBpMp7d-lpVpxuwbVuip_eYzlHkG\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIC9QhfV23fiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The Paarl born athlete says he is working hard in training preparing for next year. Bruintjies said: “You never know how ASA conduct their things. I don’t want to waste my energy worrying about whether I’ll make the team or not. “ASA have their way of doing things and I don’t want to focus on that. I’m done worrying about such things.”Bruintjies said it was the federation’s fault that he missed out on the World Championships.He said: “I did qualify for the world champs according to the IAAF qualifying standards, but not ASA standards.“But as I mentioned earlier, I don’t want to focus on small things that won’t get me anywhere.”The South African season will start a month earlier next year because of the Commonwealth Games in April, but Bruintjies said that won’t affect his training programme.Bruintjies added: “It’s good for me that the season starts early because I did not stop training and I’m in the best possible condition.“I’m happy and enjoying my training.”On his chances in Birmingham, Bruintjies said he was targeting a podium finish.He said: “ SA has not had podium finishes in the 100m for many years and I would be happy to change that.”
