is suspected to be a domestic violence related incident.”Although the suspect's motive for the attack is still
being investigated, the suspect is believed to have been released from St
Albans Prison recently where he was held after being arrested in connection
with numerous violent crimes of robberies and car hijackings since as early as
2009, Beegte said.Most cases against the man have been withdrawn and some
cases are still before court, Beegte said."The suspect will be appearing before the New
Brighton Magistrates’ Court on 27 December on a charge of attempted murder.
Further investigation, in this case, will continue," added Beegte. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-arrested-for-allegedly-shooting-girlfriend-20171225
