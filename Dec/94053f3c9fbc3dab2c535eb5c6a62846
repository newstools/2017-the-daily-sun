Nontombi’s daughter (3) died after being loaded into an ambulance. Nontombi shared her version of events in a statement read on her behalf. She said she approached Mboro for financial help after failing to get treatment at the local clinic for her daughter, who she had been told was dehydrated. She said an ambulance was called to the church but it took an hour to arrive and by that time her daughter was very weak with a swollen face. “We were told over 40 people had called for an ambulance and Mboro’s church was not the only place requesting an ambulance.”
