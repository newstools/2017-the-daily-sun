Then he went to his shack.He was found on Sunday morning, hanging from the roof of his shack. Lirontso Ramatsana (22), Bekikhaya’s girlfriend, said she is heartbroken to lose the father of her three-month-old child. But she believes if she had not managed to run away from the fight, he would have killed her. “We used to fight, as couples do. But yesterday he was furious and wanted to beat me up,” she said.“He didn’t like it when I complained about having so little money for clothes and groceries. “When he threatened me with a knife, I grabbed my child and ran for my life.”She said she spent the night a few streets away at Bekikhaya’s uncle’s house because she was afraid.“I went back the next morning, hoping he would not be angry anymore, but I got the shock of my life when I found him hanging in our shack,” she said.“He was sitting on the bed and a rope from the roof was around his neck. I took a knife and cut the rope from around his neck, but it was too late.”She said he left her with a young child and she is unemployed. “Although he wasn’t working, we never went to bed on an empty stomach,” said Lirontso.“I’m heartbroken that he is dead but I believe he would have killed me if I hadn’t run away.”Bekikhaya started a new job at the beginning of November and he had just received his first salary. According to Lirontso her boyfriend gave her R1 200 to buy food and clothes for herself and the baby. But she complained as she felt it was too little. The dead man’s uncle, Dumisani Mthembu (62), said: “We didn’t expect him to die so soon. He was a good child and when the family had problems, he solved them. “I was with his niece when we heard about his death early on Sunday morning. We don’t know what caused him to end his life like this.” He said he had never heard of a person hanging himself while sitting down.“Bekikhaya was bewitched because he had just got a job. He was not working for a long time and got the first pay on Friday,” said Dumisani.Nontlatla Jiba, his cousin, said she was close to Bekikhaya.“I used to help him when he wasn’t working. Now that he had a job I was expecting him to help me. I don’t know what made him take such a big decision to end his life. Only God knows.”Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said an inquest has been opened.
