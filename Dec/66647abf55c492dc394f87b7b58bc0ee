They help people with kidney problems as well as those with high blood pressure.” When she was speaking to the People’s Paper she was already out out of stock. She said her tea was hot property ekasi.“They don’t just help people who are sick but also those with a low sex drive.” Nonkosi said she almost regretted making her husband tea with her special stock.“He didn’t give me time to sleep. I almost regretted ever giving it to him. He kept me busy,” she said.Nonkosi also sells affordable secondhand clothes in her kasi because many people can’t afford new clothes from shops.“My clothes start from as little as R10. I cater for almost everyone. “My plan is to ensure nobody is cold on the streets.” Nonkosi has been in the clothing business for only three months but has been selling the special tea for a long time.“I sell my teabags for R55 but sometimes people come with R20 and say they don’t have money.“When I can tell they’re sick and need my help I end up helping them.“Unfortunately many of these people don’t return when they do have money,” she said.
