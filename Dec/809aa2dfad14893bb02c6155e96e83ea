Alpha (39) was driving in the area when he saw the cop’s car blocking the road. “I asked him to move his car so I could pass,” he said. He allegedly swore at him, got out of his car, and assaulted him.  Alpha opened a case and the cop was bust on Saturday. Resident Sabelo Mkhize (31) said many other incidents involving the cop had not been reported.  KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault and pointing a firearm was opened at the Nkandla Police Station. “A suspect aged 31 was arrested,” said Zwane.  “He’s in custody awaiting his second court appearance on Thursday.  “Other victims are advised to open cases so we can investigate.” Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said he was not aware of the matter.
