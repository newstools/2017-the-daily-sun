Almost 80% of motorists believe removing
unroadworthy vehicles from South African roads will make roads safe, reports
the AA in its annual ‘Safer Roads in SA’ survey.  The survey shows 58% of respondents believe harsher
punishments for all road offenders will also reduce fatality statistics.The AA said: "There are too many unsafe cars
on our roads, and these lead to many crashes, some of them fatal. As motorists
we need to ensure our vehicles are safe, not only for our use, but for other
motorists as well. If we want to improve our road crash statistics, keeping our
cars roadworthy is an important step in that direction."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Respondents also indicated a need for stricter
policing and a need for increased road safety education at schools in SA.Do you agree with the results of the 'Safer Roads
in SA' survey? What do you think should be done to curb road deaths in SA?
Email us'Education needed'"Road safety education in schools, in our
view, is critical to ensuring road safety in the future. Children need to be
taught the rules of the road, how to be safer pedestrians and, ultimately,
there needs to be a progression in this education to where the child is of
driving age," the AA said.Other factors motorists highlighted for road
safety: Rigorous training for learner drivers (38%) Increased public education via road safety
campaigns (38%) Safer cars by manufacturers (13%)The AA reports: "A number of provinces are
already reporting fatal crashes. It is estimated that road fatalities in South
Africa cost our economy almost R143-billion in 2016. But the real cost of fatal
crashes cannot be measured in monetary terms alone; the real cost is the
destruction to families caused by the loss of a loved one. We urge all
motorists to play their role this festive season in ensuring everyone has a
safe journey. "Should this not happen our annual fatality
statistics will either stay relatively similar or, worse, increase on last
year’s shocking statistics."The AA offers these tips to motorists travelling
during the festive season:•             Keep
vehicles in good working condition•             Check
the tyres (including the spare) and replace them if needed•             Obey
the rules of the road at all times, and set an example for young children or
inexperienced drivers•             Buckle
up everyone in the vehicle. Remember, children under three are required by law
to be in proper child restraint seats•             Stop
every two hours or every 200km for fresh air•             Be
courteous and considerate of other drivers•             Don’t
drive under the influence of alcohol, drugs or medication•             Obey
the speed limit, and drive according to the conditions of the road you are on•             Don’t
overtake on blind rises or over solid white lines•             Pay
attention to the road. Keep your cellphone handy for emergencies, but don’t use
it while driving"At this time of year, when traffic on major
routes across the country is expected to increase significantly, we want to
urge all drivers to obey the rules of the road, and to drive safely to and from
their holiday destinations," the AA says.http://www.wheels24.co.za/News/Guides_and_Lists/sa-motorists-say-get-bad-cars-off-the-road-punish-offenders-aa-survey-20171214
