    THE health department continues to struggle with fraud and corruption by officials.The north West Health Department last week announced that it had suspended five officials for allegedly defrauding Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp of more than R1,2 million.Their alleged corrupt activities went on for seven months and were discovered this month.The officials were given a chance to convince the district health office that they shouldn’t be suspended.Spokeswoman Nthabiseng Sebake said their suspected criminal activities were reported to the police.North West Health MEC Magome Masike assured the public that all cases of fraud and corruption would be properly investigated and action would be taken against all those found on the wrong side of the law.“The department wishes to state that its anti-corruption policy will be strictly enforced.“I’m warning officials who engage in criminal activities that they will immediately be dismissed from the public service and may end up in prison,” he said.This comes just three months after a former Free State health department worker was charged with 194 cases of fraud, money laundering, forgery and uttering.The accused worked in a psychiatric hospital in the Free State in the supply chain management division. He was alleged to have defrauded the department of R7,8 million between 2013 and 2015.Similar cases have been reported in the Eastern Cape and KZN, where eight suspects were investigated for similar crimes in 2015.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvMtdRzJpvSufPLx-pwcZ4sEvTmCeIHOS31DgL1CT9hgbAbDk1Vvr-OE28CxFSfRPvemMnstJvkrPktuA7LU3c5Ac425p6cF_e7WTYtus8Qx0cUV_EtboHJd3zcGJyasxv4h0RlDg6M8mvQIFXJ9c0VUEZx28uKdY8DZEEBKpj5bjPUhq9lbNe5C-_az1esespspIh1slxb0Llx62b4yLtcNrmOooGpX3F4T3KK4I5jmH2r2h0IofUJQLsq2fpT0ZljDB8sO2-tahjSGNxrBsgysj817Io\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF5QIK3wByreEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
