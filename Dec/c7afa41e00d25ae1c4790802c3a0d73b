    MZANSI health authorities have been left shocked following a huge spike in the number of cases of deadly listeriosis.Private and public hospitals reported 557 confirmed cases of the food-borne bacterial disease, which is almost seven times higher than the annual average in the country.The disease – which is caused by a bacteria found in soil, water, vegetation and meat – saw 70 people getting hospitalised.Thirty-six of them died!Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi expressed concern at the historical jump in the number of listeriosis cases.Briefing the media in Tshwane yesterday about the outbreak, he said sufferers show flu-like symptoms with diarrhoea including fever, general body pains, vomiting and weakness.Motsoaledi issued a strong warning that if left untreated, symptoms could lead to infection of the bloodstream (septicemia or sepsis) which ultimately could lead to an infection of the brain (meningoencephalitis).Anyone can get the disease, but newborns, the elderly, pregnant women and persons with weak immunity such as those with HIV/Aids, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver or kidney diseases were at high risk.He said while listeriosis is a disease that is seen in our hospitals every year, typically only 60 to 80 cases are detected and treated yearly.This year the Chris Hani Baragwanath and Steve Biko hospitals alerted the National Institute of Communicable Diseases about unusually high numbers of babies with the disease.Most cases were reported in Gauteng, Western Cape and KZN.“The source of this outbreak is currently being investigated,” he said.To prevent listeriosis in your home:Always make sure that raw fruits and vegetables are rinsed under running water.Wash hands, cooking utensils and counter tops after preparing and handling uncooked foods.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss4Ckio1kj0Pr1GVKckXL5vnKle8_uVwYu8WLVHZZp0qUtvqxwH2iPtUq7sTOLWX8eY1lCCuRaLkN1dtjhY-Z-aOL7rAJ6J7uU4M5Zn__LRt6lEnzPMdjB4Vs7dfm_Em38fBIFPV2q1JqmFcYsG48wAxfo-fgB1DQ77A1-fg66zD1CIFSsl04Gw5OxoYKZLk3ZEUPzxEw6RuoSwKs2mKkds1DHK8DUkZas-PRmb0O7krnK_PSmi71HLBLL5QIiaUXKrgDs_wY2F1sCn8kqg1AWsep1d5vA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzChs4g25dEghEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
