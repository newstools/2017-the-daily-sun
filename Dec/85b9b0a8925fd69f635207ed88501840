I had a feeling before the game that I would score, but not two goals.”The former Baroka FC star praised his teammates for their support that made it possible for him to score. He added: “I could not have done this alone. It was teamwork. We played well and according to the coach’s (Veselin Jelusic’s) plan.”Letsoalo revealed that he had been frustrated by his failure to score in the first round.“The job of a striker is to score goals and when the goals are not coming you get stressed and frustrated,” he said.“In my situation the technical team and my teammates tried to help me. I was praying to God all the time for goals to come. I hope the frustration is over and our fans will see more goals from me.”Letsoalo aims to help Celtic challenge for trophies. “I would love to see my name up there with the leading PSL goal-scorers. I have noticed that the guys leading the pack haven’t scored many goals – I can catch up. I want to score five goals before the league goes into recess for the festive season.”Celtic have been impressive this season. They are fourth in the league table with 19 points from 12 games. Letsoalo will get the chance to increase his tally when they face Tshwane giants Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday (3.30pm).
