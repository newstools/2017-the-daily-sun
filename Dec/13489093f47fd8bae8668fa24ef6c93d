By the time they went to the hospital, it was too late and Lungisa had already lost his sight.He was enrolled at Efata School for the Blind and Deaf in Mthatha, where he sharpened his writing talent.Since 1999, he has won many awards and his name appears at his school as a great praise singer. One of Lungisa’s secrets is that before he begins to praise someone, he touches and feels the person’s face.He said growing up with a disability was hard, especially when people didn’t accept him, but his life has been all about positive thinking.“At school I was taught how to use a computer and I write my stories in my head before putting them down. Sometimes I use the app that helps blind people.”Lungisa started off by imitating poets who were on radio before starting to write his own poems in 1999 and falling in love with storytelling. He performed his first poem about Aids before his school teachers.“My dream is for my stories and poems to be published. I finished my book a while ago but need a publisher,” said Lungisa.He has won many awards for poetry and storytelling at festivals including the SEK Mqhayi Award and has represented his school around the country.Lungisa tells listeners his stories on Unitra Community Radio and said his audience really enjoys them.“Sometimes I get phone calls from my listeners telling me to drive safely and that’s funny. When I am on radio, no one can tell I am blind.“Even when I perform on stage my message is clear and no one would say it comes from a blind man.“I pray that every blind person could learn to be independent and not depend on others because people like us are taken for a ride. Life is easier when you accept who you are instead of drowning in misery.” Manager Vuyisa Kulase said they are blessed to have Lungisa at the radio station. He said he is very talented and needs a place where he could shine even more.
