    THREE unions marched to parliament yesterday to demand protection for emergency services workers.The unions – Health and Other Services Personnel Trade Union of SA, Federation of Unions of South Africa and United National Transport Union – want their members to be protected from criminals while in the line of duty.Dennis George, the general secretary of Fedusa, said: “We are being brutally attacked every day while doing our job.“We are calling for an end to this, and that the responsible ministries act.”George said he was happy with the collective decision taken by soldiers and cops to work together during the festive season.He also demanded, according to their memorandum, that an indaba be held early next year in which the departments of labour, health, the police and defence come up with ideas to ensure the safety of health workers.Cosatu provincial chairman Michael Mayalo said: “The only solution is to sjambok the thugs.“The police must know that, from today, we will sjambok the thugs because what they are doing is causing pain to our people.”Parliamentary provincial chief inspector David Esu accepted the memorandum of grievances. “We will take your demands to the relevant ministries,” he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvBeH_USzlJKkqkAYVphsrRQ-PoI7BSmSiShoXKVgHpw6--VbBJ5CIEZ3JIe7kU1Grylyx3c0vG2B9lGSQOJkv3SQSEJEXRxoVMARjk734FH9YlqlPaYRrUIQc1jkl1VOV2GsGOcRfYcd2tIs2HZ5qxVFdPJ59OHMaMx8LivRbKBK-vadvMdWmZDjArC9W5A2V1SszA08ao_uixQrXoARHEkMjTjUDm9_UeKbZmfaA0SZ3s6E4EJTdlePTfEQzYt-ajPkJVxZ3Ixjllrj2-Azv1_CzHrOg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEMydaWVpZe_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
