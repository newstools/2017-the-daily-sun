We discussed the highs, lows and plans going forward.”One of the key promises he made to the committee was to forge closer relationships with PSL clubs and their coaches.Said Baxter: “We and the PSL have to be on the same page. My goal is to have a closer working relationship and much stronger bond of co-operation between Bafana and the PSL. “It’ll benefit both parties, especially getting youngsters to successfully come through the ranks.“I also realise we have a problem with goal-scorers in Mzansi. This is something we and the PSL clubs need to work together in trying to resolve.”Baxter said he had learnt from past mistakes.“The biggest disappointment was not qualifying for the World Cup in Russia next year.” But he said one of the flaws in the squad’s make-up was lack of mental toughness when playing against smaller countries.Baxter also admitted that the Fifa ruling, in which the association ordered Bafana to replay their controversial 2-1 home win against Senegal, affected players and his plans to reach Russia.Said Baxter: “There’s no question the Fifa decision to order a replay affected us. It meant we faced five cup finals in our qualifying campaign and there was pressure on us in every one of those games. We had to win everyone, we couldn’t afford to slip up and, when we did, it affected the players and affected us tactically.“Sadly, we lost it when we were beaten back-to-back by Cape Verde. I believe we’d have qualified had we won those games. Mentally, we didn’t dig deep enough. It’s not just in the past seven months but I noticed this trend in the past, where we have this mental block to some countries. We have to learn to deal with it.” Baxter is at the Cosafa Under-20 tournament in Kitwe, Zambia, where the SA U-20 squad are competing.Said Baxter: “I’m on the lookout for new budding talent that I can groom for Bafana in the future.”
