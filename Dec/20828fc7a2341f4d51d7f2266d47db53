    BAROKA FC midfielder Letladi Madubanya has pleaded with his teammates to pull up their socks when they meet a rejuvenated Maritzburg United in an Absa Premiership clash at Harry Gwala tonight (8pm).The Polokwane lads are still reeling from a shock 4-0 league defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns who dethroned them at the summit. Madubanya told SunSport that the humiliating defeat was a blessing in disguise, as some players were getting big-headed.  Although Baroka are tied with Downs and Chippa United on 19 points, the former African champions have a better goal difference and three games in hand.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzy253EVwnDqZEj-bfpsf8eac17CCzoRQjvgQCAvzDJfJlqrQiTJpZwsOiGTuGImGyRZGg8cpPS22g0OCczWinBmhObDe7NuxPIH-6oWYyDgRHfwBWikWrRbtdhOUVSYFWmgOMx57lXAdQJOau0T_eSbk-tDOazSM2CgW6WSvwW2u4LqyLrGwmo77iueSpznH2ZRXm6nYGi-lu78etKIf9mbZ9XW2_lTy2wkmt4FrCdEbBpn0e4KXy1jKgBmZ-rOs7n-jKkE-dwwLei4OX\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAhoAoJYnX37EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It was the right time to be shown that nothing comes easy in the PSL. Players were getting cocky, thinking it was nice at the top. This gives us a chance to look back on what we did wrong.”After that rude awakening, Madubanya reckons they are ready for Maritzburg, who will come at them with guns blazing in a bid to win their second game in a row.Maritzburg will go into the match with their confidence high having registered their first win in nine league matches when they beat Cape Town City 4-2 in Durban on Tuesday. Maritzburg are 11th in the table with 14 points from 11 games.“We didn’t cover each other against Sundowns, we left a lot of open space for them to attack. If any of us tell ourselves we are a so-called big team, we need to grow up. “We got a hiding here (Harry Gwala), as Maritzburg beat us 3-1 last season, proving it will be another tough match.“We have been here for two days to prepare and get used to conditions. Players are quiet at breakfast, which shows they are thinking about the game. We know we need to start producing results.”
