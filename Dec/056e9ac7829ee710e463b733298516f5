He was in a happy relationship but needed a job. That changed after meeting the prophet who promised to solve his money problems.“I don’t know who he was but I met him on the street and we started talking. “When I told him about my difficulty in finding a job, the sangoma offered to pray for me and I agreed.”The man took him to his house.“He prayed and said he would help me find a job, but instead he transferred some evil spirits into my body that killed my sex drive.”He said he started to notice changes to his 4-5.“I began to feel like there were things moving inside me and they moved down to my private parts.”After that he noticed his penis was no longer as big as it was before. Even his girlfriend told him his poking was no longer any good. “My 4-5 stopped getting hard and soon my lover left me.”He said he went to various doctors who they all said they couldn’t find anything wrong with him.“When medical doctors failed to help me, I went to see prophets who all gave me different ideas, advice and herbs for my problem. But none of them helped.”Sangoma Emmanuel Mathonsi advised Philemon to consult a traditional healer.He said the problem could be caused by an ex-girlfriend who put a spell on him.
