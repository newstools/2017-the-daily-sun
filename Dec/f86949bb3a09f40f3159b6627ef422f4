officer alleged stopped the driver and requested to see the drivers licence.From
the video, the man is heard demanding his drivers licence back from the
officer, he is also seen trying to pull it forcefully from the officer’s hands
with the help of another woman.It
appears what made matters worse was the officer trying to get the residential
address from the driver when wanted to issue a traffic fine.The
aggressive driver is head saying, “Give me back my license, which address do
you want?”The
officer recording is heard explaining that they don’t accept postal address but
on residential address.After
pushing and pulling, the man is seen hitting the officer on the hand before
choking him in full view of the occupants of his car and the female cops who
were with the cop.The
driver and the woman were arrested on Sunday.North
West Police Spokeswoman Lieutenant Colonel Pelonomi Makau told Daily Sun that
police in Potchefstroom are investigating a case of common assault after
traffic officer was allegedly assaulted by a men and a woman.“They
were expected to appear at the Potchefstroom Magistrate court on Monday on
charges of common assault.” Minister of Roads and Transport Joe Maswanganyi reacted in
shock and dismay.Mathebula said  according to the officer, these
people were overtaking on barrier line and when the officer was giving him a
ticket then he says he doesn’t know his physical address .He went on said good
news is he behind bars and they denied him bail.  Maswanganyi said on his facebook that he spoke with the MEC
in North West Dr Motlhabane that the culprit must be arrested. He said the MEC
is busy attending to the matter in Klerksdorp.“An attack on the law enforcer is an attack on the state,
the culprit must brought to the book” said Maswanganyi  One facebook user Keitumetse Mathiba said this criminal
must be behind bars and not even see the festive season, This is really
undermine the law and our traffic offices.
