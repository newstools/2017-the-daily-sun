live a normal life.“Look where it is; it goes far below the knees,” he told
the Independent.“I cannot do anything; I cannot work, and I am disabled,
so I want authorities to declare me as a disabled person and give me support.”Cabrera has suffered health issues and his penis has to
sleep on its own pillow at night to avoid discomfort to his back.His sex life has also suffered. “I can never penetrate
anyone because it is too thick,” he told the publication. The tip's
circumference is 25cm.He has attempted sex twice, but the first woman got
scared when she saw the actual size and a second attempt failed when it was too
painful for the woman. But he has declined surgery to reduce its size,
believing that one day you will meet a woman with the right size punani.According to the Huffington
Post, Cabrera is now depended on the government for food stamps as his
disability has made it impossible for him to work. http://www.health24.com/News/nsfw-man-with-worlds-biggest-penis-now-disabled-20171215
