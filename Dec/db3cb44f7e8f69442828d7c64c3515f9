    THE holiday season means young kids spend more time riding waves and enjoying the beaches, but this often comes with tragedy.On Saturday a 13-year-old boy disappeared beneath the waves when he allegedly got into difficulties while swimming at a no-swimming area in Sheffield beach, near KwaDukuza, in northern KZN.Paul Herbst, spokesman for the Medical Rescue Services, said the search for the boy started immediately after paramedics were alerted to his disappearance.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssCmyH7hPoJaUBYmYzvA-vQwbCDaBdtjtcYTbS0ZjSmJgsL3DFTHMuE0q3yyauiZs_KBlwHlcALGSGOf5MOBjf1M6RsvSduttlzvQVMIrn88LUD2BEgOxob-3KEf2_h2eLDsbN2hdsH3S3kZBPSwJbIrxfPjfkZxjUrWOLc7B5T2Z1h0bGce09V2iouQYcFTPCpxhuyb_gsIRs8lPe0wB8Pea1piFcJFlePRqoWz117Tzgz_Cs2H9_MnA8eczKzH5CTTkQjpQwoqcCWPVKZ7cs7tTL1NII\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE9bxGJa0_-TEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But due to high winds and rough sea conditions, the search was called off after three hours,” he said.Herbst said witnesses said the boy suddenly disappeared under the waves.Provincial police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident and said it was handled by the KwaDukuza cops.“The search continues at the scene and it is currently being treated as a missing person’s case. Our members from the Durban Search and Rescue are still there,” she said.KZN Emergency Medical Services spokesman Robert McKenzie warned swimmers to ensure their safety by obeying beach rules.He advised people not to swim in no-swimming areas as that could lead to drowning.“People should only swim in the areas where there are life guards who can rescue them if they encounter difficulties in the water. “They should ensure at all time that they are swimming in between the flags.“That is an indication that the area is safe.” McKenzie added that beach visitors should obviously not consume alcohol before getting into the water as it increased their chances of drowning.
