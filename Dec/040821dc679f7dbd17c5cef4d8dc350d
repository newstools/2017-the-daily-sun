    A MAN who has repeatedly been in trouble with the law for
flashing his 4-5 was back in court this month for the same offense.According to The
Plymouth Herald, Stephen Jory (36) from Penzance in the south of England
has had the bad habit of showing strange women his 4-5 for years. He was first hauled to court for it in 2013, but only a
year later exposed his 4-5 to a female doctor in her surgery. He was then
jailed for 18 months.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstS7V8p_GxSE--Rtnihb1vju4Ob76JIw9N-CW5IGI5em8amIbaC5X2zbj1tEjIrWsgqUJ_0OP5PzXytaLJhWFnZXWm1QrOPm92RgQb9amtmWp4XCM4_clPaEI4P4ZgI9oHl8HTDazgAFAmtIjyHvmjeYQmpZljExW94KGvOSAT_7mcbGP-GNrb5hlnVOR1PSHfo67zih4iY01n1hHsLihpaE184OD2FkvoDospnYRqW4gUC--kk7YnU64DuhnhmSSb3EjhnouWspg_abU6cQKwBfuzXmP1ixaiA1A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzE3K57VbOv8pEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

him again on the streets of the city, and he once again found himself in court
for exposing his 4-5 to a woman.He pleaded guilty a week ago in Plymouth Crown Court to
indecently exposing himself.Judge Ian Lawrie said Jory had a “compulsion to expose
his penis”. In a bid to try and help Jory get over his weird urges, Lawrie
sentenced him to a three-year community order with 55 days of intensive supervision. “You have a lot of
work to do,” the judge is quoted as saying.
