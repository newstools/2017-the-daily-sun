    SOUTH Africa’s Under-20 national team will face an acid test when they tackle Egypt again in the Cosafa U-20 Championships semifinals on Thursday (12pm). The eagerly awaited encounter between Amajita and the Young Pharaohs will take place at Nkana Stadium in Kitwe, Zambia. The two met in the final Group B match on Monday, with Amajita managing to collect maximum points when they came back from a goal down to win 2-1 and top their group with nine points. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4pZSc0CaCHRtmyNlBBhNp8atctRilhOoKOO18BxXTQ22G1Jl6d8vd01eDW8QXVQweTIpiSWh30f5WPpoLV7Hju3wUiMn41B57aHYEKIiO3nKh2xFkyAeIRrhVVFiqPF6hjLv9bJ3srSecZiYhhauqRFVtyqw9OprGMyBSSxnQ7tNabFLhOqTX61frNWNUBYo1TGLvUR4-CihjGlc3ppj_h4EbFE327Vn107n7rYrfyMaLWlBZ0I_LmU-8dnLGUFCoVu3K8T7Fm9AqEf0J\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCqUk9-SqYZUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Malebogo Modise is expected to lead the team in the absence of Mukumela.“Two players are suspended but for us we don’t see challenges – it’s another opportunity for two players to represent Amajita at international level. “We came here with 20 players, we will easily replace them,” said Senong.The coach admitted, however, that the Egyptians are not an easy nut to crack. “We are fully aware that knockout stages are a different ball game,” Senong said. “The mental demands will be different, but we are looking forward to the game. “We came here to develop our players and they understand how I want them to play. We are proud of what the boys have accomplished so far.”
