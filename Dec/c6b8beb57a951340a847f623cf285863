Three years later he saw a newspaper advertising a bursary at the University of Western Cape. “I applied but couldn’t get a place, but I was accepted at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology in 2014,” he said. On Tuesday his lifelong dream became a reality when he graduated with a national diploma in accounting.“I cannot express my happiness that I have managed to fulfil my dream. “I hope more doors will open for me,” said an excited Mzameki.His mother, Nogaweni Sibunzi (64), could not hide her joy.“I am so proud of my son for pushing on despite the hard times. “As a family we are smiling today because he is a hard worker,” she said.Mzameki said his taxi driver colleagues thought he was lying when he told them he was studying. He said he attended lectures during the day and went to work afterwards.“I have already started looking for an accounting job.”
