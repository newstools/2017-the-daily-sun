According to Mashiteng, on the night of the incident Sibusiso had been fighting with a man over a girlfriend.  “He called his friend, Themba Nkosi, who was armed with a firearm.”  He said on arrival Themba allegedly shot the man who was fighting with Sibusiso. “He shot him once in the chest and the man died instantly,” said Mashiteng. He said the police don’t have Themba’s photo but are looking for both men.  “They’re still at large and an investigation is underway for their arrest.” He said the two men are armed and dangerous.  “Anyone who sees them should not approach them but call the police.”
