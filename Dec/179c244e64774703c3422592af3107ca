Other inmates who were queueing to use the phone got angry, but Pistorius wouldn’t budge and that’s when a fight broke out.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsszlg-qq3-wlz0S8MbD_FT4rbZnjB0B_vYjapDSrfBvlmXbP7pC76sy-U5jpiXtwNBJZbhOc2Ze8XbJZJXZ-Kp53U21c28G3I9xxN5UaxEGQ0FkmPvm1JL5F1ry8eHiNHZgLBWqIT0d_Y6_w9Fbn7Rl_Gu_coFWbzwiUk4ZsLgQK3mIZJ2cGwzVo_v8YBR7aJqCQ_V_DmdLGr93tStDTRixefKCIFtOuQG32CEC_dNSaodIAH05EL2h-uIBtRTRz0AQI0PhDFU5S4QVNlowJ0o6-PZw_K4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNLZVlB3si_IEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He was arrested on Valentine’s Day 2013 for shooting and killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Ofentse Morwane, Gauteng Correctional Service’s spokesman, said: “Oscar Pistorius sustained a minor injury last week. An internal investigation will establish the facts and ensure that appropriate action is taken as incidents of assaults are not allowed.”
