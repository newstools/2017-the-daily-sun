    COPS must not die with guns in their holsters.This was the message sent to officers by police commissioner General Khehla Sitole at the launch of Operation Safer Festive Season at the Union Buildings in Tshwane on Friday.Addressing about 150 cops, the commissioner said the safety of police officers comes first.“Crime cannot be fought with a demoralised workforce. I am behind you, no matter what happens during this operation.”He warned cops not to target the public but to go straight for criminals.“Young people should be able to occupy public spaces with no fear if we are there,” he said.Meanwhile, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said he was pleased with the work done by cops this festive season.Mbalula said since the start of the police campaign to clean the streets of South Africa, several firearms and drug caches had been seized.“On 6 December, KZN cops arrested four men, one of whom is a policeman, following an ongoing probe into murders at Glebelands Hostel,” said Mbalula.The arrests come a week after the minister launched a satellite police station near the hostel.“The arrest of an officer must serve as a clear warning that the South African Police Service will never tolerate the betrayal of the badge.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvdvgcLuxobXbdhEDu7rXliTrjvhPR86seOl0LqawBJvZz3VnOGAEdHEalU-8oGsDVNgIq9tyHMWjkAoEOmVhkBSh05Msk_kK5Rp0LpHJi3s1U1Pl9urfF9IHQH0FfI5u2MB3LiZs2FXTid0mlJTbeJBtHirbHe5dP0WQP_Jkz6w93-qcDm1e8IT6-TcIRANG_y-7t_j9gaNK2kHADDdW8hnTSXAbU21aSEIprf34MJw8J6sHpRjxpz5bbYoV3U-IDWUEMvnGYeBcS70yEdhllNaVw29Zg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPLhoPjI3XHDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
