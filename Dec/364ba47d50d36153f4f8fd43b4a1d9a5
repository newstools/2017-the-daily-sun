THE RESIDENTS blame the municipality. The municipality holds the contractor responsible. But while people play the blame game, nothing is done to close deadly holes full of water. AND ONCE AGAIN, A MOTHER cries over the body of a child killed by negligence. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuP8tigMr2yCi5eoV8h45l9pQHsO0iOvsJ_g4G26ob80R5sn0AyG1CXC1saiuA7HPwHslqm2vRxRDejnRNMr7zw5ryh5Uq3bF6bR7rrm7LW7IpyZcVuhVnrYY-f4PbcdSQ3P3qDVeIbaH6f0BtQq_FlvVWroPnlY6CmNVe-U9j9EJOBdzW8_67zbiYsQE0BarxePDccikgV6KKcHfcT_j4C6ZT0TccrqJ0m1dN-rYADSUm6-_0ETYfHvQTob0o3X7HBwCpaAgGPqm3NP7lmXeTgIg4GhBk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPQKXOH95ecEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They said there were many in the area.“We are wondering whose child will be next,” said a resident.The child’s mother, Zinhle Makhanya, was too devastated to speak, but Thando’s gogo, Thembeka (53) said the child chased after a ball and fell into the three metre hole near her shack. Family and neighbours pulled her out but it was too late. When paramedics arrived, she was already dead.“The municipality sends a contractor but never does an inspection,” said neighbour Khonzaphi Dlamini.“It rains almost every day now and these holes get full when our yards are flooded. “It is a serious problem but the municipality doesn’t take us seriously.” William Ntladi, spokesman for the Ekurhuleni Emergency Services, said paramedics tried to revive the two year-old but it was too late.Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Themba Gadebe sent condolences to the family.A statement said a letter was sent to the contractor, Mogoba Maphuthi and Associates, when the contract expired in June asking the contractor to ensure the site was safe when it was vacated.The contractor refused to vacate the site and maintained that it was still responsible for the site, including the health and safety conditions. The contractor has agreed to take care of funeral costs and funeral arrangements are ongoing. Ekurhuleni Municipality will undertake its own investigation and will make a report by Friday. An inquest docket was opened at Benoni cop shop.
