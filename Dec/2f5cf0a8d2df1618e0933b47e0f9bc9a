He said what made it worse was the captain said he did not feel safe and wanted to avoid tanother 9/11.The EFF has slammed the incident.“We call on British Airways to institute an independent investigation into this situation headed by an independent body or senior counsel. “The captain, together with the crew, must be placed under immediate suspension and face the full might of the law,” said the party.
