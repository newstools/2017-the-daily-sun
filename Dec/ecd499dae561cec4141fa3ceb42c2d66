But the Bafana Bafana left back’s concern is the fact that his side is still struggling to collect points in the Absa Premiership.Wits will get the chance to get off the bottom of the table on Wednesday (7.30pm) when they host fellow-strugglers Ajax Cape Town at Milpark’s Bidvest Stadium.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstYfYSEO0ulOoeKZ_Jkrf8-j5TA0apFiXGteVHhx6qnRlOBkN0eO_uswnug0wAF7bFWlXVnvFOg0Jgly7Mq1w6eVyXhAXZaQBkxgMPxiooWRDXxAMhKy7Sa_ignlDnHpJQDyFl2_kjHrn4aNoK35KTBNSSiRwjDW34E3mBCou7jR4i1q6d2jEf_7QaSzWz_RHBQVrrcHSZ28ZUVQdS7JyZPi7-Ny1a-ZBNfK1hCuGutiuE9-7zKD_ffDkZzKyhjhfPTwTMbBQSersKZd6f4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBA8Se96TbJOEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They have drawn three, lost six and collected a mere nine points.Said Hlanti: “To be where we are in the table is not a pretty sight as champions. It’s bad – and sad – to see ourselves there. “It’s a concerning factor and we know we are the only people who can change the situation. No one at the club planned to start our title defence this way. It’s disappointing.”Hlanti said there was no time to be excited about their Telkom Knockout glory, instead they must double their work rate to improve in the league.“We can’t be over the moon about this while our log standing is not exciting. Telkom happiness is done and dusted, now it is time to focus on the important factor – which is the league. ”Hlanti said they would use the Urban Warriors match as the starting point to turn their fortunes around. “We have three matches left before the festive break and need to ensure we get at least seven points. We’ll start on Wednesday – we can’t afford to get anything less than three points.“It’s time we move away from the relegation zone.”
