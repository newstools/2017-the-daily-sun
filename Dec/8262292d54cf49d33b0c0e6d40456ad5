conditions kids under 13 cannot open accounts of their own due to their ages.It comes with strict parental control.“Messenger Kids won't show ads or collect data for
marketing, though it will collect some data it says are necessary to run the
service,” Facebook said.Facebook also said that it won't automatically move users to
the regular Messenger or Facebook when they get old enough, though the company
might give them the option to move contacts to Messenger at a later stage.The app is available on Apple devices, and the Android
version will be launched soon.
