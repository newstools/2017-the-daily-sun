Matsatsantsa a Pitori are playing catch-up on their league programme and appear to have lost their confidence, especially winger Thuso Phala who missed a sitter in the opening half.United face another difficult away trip on Wednesday to play Bloemfontein Celtic at the Dr Molemela Stadium to finish the year. They are 11th on 15 points after 10 fixtures.In the KwaZulu-Natal derby that took place in Durban Golden Arrows were unable to break their nine-match winless run in the Premiership, playing to a goalless draw with Maritzburg United at Princess Magogo Stadium.Arrows went into the match on the back of a poor run, their bright start to the season seemingly a thing of the past.Clinton Larsen has been shielded from pressure thanks to an inconsistent run from fellow-PSL sides, with many league matches ending in draws. They were hardly spoiling for a fight yesterday though, which seems to have become a trend of late. Apart from Man of the Match Nkanyiso Mngengwe, it is hard to pick positives from this match.Finishing remains a problem for many PSL teams, but it’s no excuse for a team playing at home and hardly creating clear cut chances.The Team of Choice have had a better campaign, their run of two wins ended by a narrow loss to Mamelodi Sundowns last week.Weekend Results: Golden Arrows 0-0 Maritzburg United Baroka FC 3-1 SuperSport United Bidvest Wits 0-1 Platinum StarsKaizer Chiefs 1-0 Ajax Cape TownFree State Stars 2-1 Orlando PiratesMamelodi Sundowns 4-1 Bloemfontein CelticChippa United 0-1 Polokwane CityCape Town City 1-0 AmaZulu
