Cosatu deputy general-secretary Solly Phetoe said: “We could not turn around and support the SACP in their first election this week in Metsimaholo. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssY9KO074GKdzht6r3_PPtor0D8woI7uP9N78eco0WGrbTUgc_5wSeXGhO1JoGwBPF6L0N6I9EeQaIpSJMTE8FyDxo24wn9gIK_pJQe_inAC9YNabkV3nNUMJnl7CNeJHqMRK-_3lp_UV-O2JzHEEwiup95jXD3_JAfsKQa9KyahBThsNqfMrIaGxW613MkfvC5tnwqrNlN8xcCChswsTYilW8ii4pXox3HXoOLjjvEGCE-NBnrHfxaZUi67f-vGr1yOCQcXerxNENsKqkVjHV7s1rrc4Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCEClwy2X0vPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have a resolution from the 12th national congress of Cosatu to support the ANC in elections and that decision can only be reviewed at the 13th congress next year.” Phetoe was addressing the media at Cosatu House in Joburg after the federation’s central executive committee meeting this week. He said all alliance partners still believed in the alliance and efforts should be made to make it work.Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said the SACP had made presentations to the federation, explaining its reason for participating in the election. Speaking about the upcoming ANC elective conference, Phetoe said: “The central executive committee resolved to intensify its support and lobby for the current ANC deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, to be elected as the next ANC president at the conference. “What divides the ANC is not ideological contests but leadership contests, and we believe that the solution is to adopt a principle that says the deputy president should succeed the president. It is not too late to endorse that principle as a way of uniting the ANC.”
