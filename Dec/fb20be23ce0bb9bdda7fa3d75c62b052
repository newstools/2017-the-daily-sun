October 30, 2016 in a "military style pincer movement" at the
Heideveld railway station that was sparked by a spat in a children's park.In summing up before sentencing on Thursday, Davis said the
shooting was preceded by the Junky Funky Kids making threatening hand gestures
to the Terrible Westsiders in the park."These gangs, which operate in the Heideveld area, are
sworn enemies, locked in a perpetual vendetta," Davis said."Insults were traded and Bartlett made threatening hand
gestures to the Westsiders, intimating they were going to be taught a
lesson," he said.Bartlett was then joined by Meyer and Paulse and they also
made similar gestures to the Westsiders intimating they were going to be
attacked.One of the Westsiders walked past them and told Paulse his
life would soon be over.Davis said Paulse was a lieutenant in the gang and in a
"fit of macho pique" told Bartlett and Meyer to go and "claim
the head" of any member of the Terrible Westsiders gang.Jaffer, an inspector in the gang, approved the instruction,
and gave Bartlett a 9mm calibre star semi-automatic pistol to use.While Bartlett and Meyer went to carry out the order, Paulse
and Jaffer stood outside the Manenberg police station to create an alibi.The Westsiders were sitting on the steps at the Heideveld
railway station when they pounced.Johnson was shot in the leg and head."The attack was carried out with no regard for the
safety of the commuters at the station," said Davis, adding that it was
simply good fortune that no innocent bystanders were hurt.He found that Bartlett tried to get rid of the firearm by
dropping it in the lap of a man sitting in his yard, but this man wasn't having
it, and chased after him and told him to take his gun back.During the trial it was established that the murder was planned
or premeditated and was committed by people or a syndicate acting in the
execution or furtherance of a common purpose or conspiracy, said Davis.Therefore they had to receive the life sentence unless there
were compelling circumstances, he added.Being a gang member was also an aggravating factor in terms
of POCA.Police Captain Ian Bennett had testified during sentencing
proceedings on the devastating effect of gang activities in the Manenberg
precinct, which includes Heideveld.Davis was told of eight-year-olds running guns, drugs hidden
on babies, and 14-year-olds being convicted of murder.Davis noted some of the personal circumstances of the four.Bartlett sustained a head injury in a car accident and
cannot read or write. He joined a gang to feel that he belonged to something,
and to be part of a community.Meyer grew up in Heideveld and his brother was shot and
killed there in 2013. Paulse is unmarried and has seven children from five
different mothers.Outside the court on Thursday, Bartlett's family wailed and
sobbed, saying they were angry over his sentence."He did not shoot anyone," said his mother
Natasha, who indicated that an application for appeal might be lodged for her
son.She was also concerned that he might stop receiving the
money he had been getting after his accident because the whole family was
surviving on it.NEWS24
