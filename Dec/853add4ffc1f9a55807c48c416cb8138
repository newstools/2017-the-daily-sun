I should have done this a long time ago. I did not because I was afraid,” she said.The emotional Andile opened a case at the Joburg Central Police Station on Friday. She was accompanied by fellow Not In My Name activists.“Just like many victims, I did not report the matter because I was afraid of the country’s weak justice system.“Many cases are reported to police, but there is no justice. This is the reason I did not act.“I happen to be in the public eye. Speaking about it is my justice.”Activist Themba Masango said the long arm of the law would always catch up with culprits.“The body has many ways of reacting to the violation of rape. “In some people these traumatic experiences set off a fast or slow reaction,” he said. Andile is now a number one supporter of rape survivors and battered women. She was also in court to support the women who were assaulted by the former deputy minister of higher education and training, Mduduzi Manana. Police spokesman Captain Xoli Mbele confirmed that a case of rape had been opened at the station. No one has been arrested yet.
