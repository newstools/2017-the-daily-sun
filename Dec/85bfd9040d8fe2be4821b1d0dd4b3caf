Yesterday, Jacob Khawe was sworn in as the new mayor of the municipality. He previously served as the chairman of the transport portfolio committee in the Gauteng legislature.Mofokeng, who is also the ANC Sedibeng regional chairman, was under tremendous pressure to step down when the photo went viral on social media. A protection order was obtained against him by the family of the girl. The Gauteng ANC accepted Mofokeng’s resignation, prompting a council sitting yesterday, where Khawe was sworn in. There were cheers when speaker Maipato Tsokolibane called upon the new mayor to deliver his maiden speech.Addressing a packed hall, Khawe said he was aware of the many challenges facing the municipality and its people.In recent weeks the municipality has been in the news for its failure to pay electricity and water bills, leading to water cuts in the area.“We will make efforts to speed up the process of appointing managers, resolve all labour disputes and create a performance-based culture,” he said.He said he will be visiting all wards of the municipality in the next 120 days.“Revenue collection remains a big challenge.“I urge residents to use only what they get as free basic services. If they use more, they must please pay for it,” he said.
