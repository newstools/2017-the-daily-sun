Some 445 people sustained serious injuries in motor vehicle accidents. However, “when compared to last year’s figures around this time, the number has decreased by about 3,8%”. MEC Pat Ngomane has urged traffic law enforcers to continue bringing lawbreakers to book.Although these are preliminary statistics, Ngomane said officers should not be discouraged because if it weren’t for their concerted efforts, the situation could have been worse. “These might be figures that we have compiled but still I would like to encourage our traffic officers not to lose hope on their jobs. “We have stationed a number of officers throughout the province where they will deal with those not respecting the roads. “Drinking and driving and cellphone usage while behind the steering wheel are other problems. “I would like to urge our people to refrain from those,” he said.Ngomane has also reminded road users not to agree to be transported in unsafe vehicles with intoxicated drivers, as this places their lives at great risk. About 105 875 vehicles were stopped at road blocks in the province, which resulted in about 24 105 summonses being issued to drivers. Ngomane said 300 drivers were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol while 127 suspects were taken in for excessive speeding. Those arrested are to appear in various courts soon.
