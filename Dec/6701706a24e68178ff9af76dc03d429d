Brigadier Nduduzo Bhengu of the police’s criminal records and crime scene management team has warned people not to touch parked cars in public areas such as malls and beaches.Bhengu, a forensic expert, said some of the cars parked in public are stolen vehicles that are being sought by the cops.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstc-MfTtICx0jBYWNitu0-pQmjFsKIhtlv-MQxfjM3ApYmW4aYQvhbssIic29AZ_LsxobWQWBgtDyVCxKJTv-p8QawEX_i-cggJiUN8gauQ93TAj-Mm5w8B1-adxQDfN0GGEFTUlOQSYPdSZsKsYub8XYJ1u8VE6p_v8PuGe8l6TYtxYCERT5Btv4BoTHKYu8r_p1BErlSfIri0XIZSTnDJQ_YWWjaEJUVddiPbMjQKPfrJ9Do1-8nq6byYSzJ_yNbwqy5laesbYIQphPgoBfNQSG7hvTc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBptAJgHnWOmEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We scan the vehicle for finger, body and shoe prints, as well as DNA.“It is never considered that the hair or saliva could have fallen from a passerby. Once that evidence is captured, that person is labelled as a suspect who possibly stole the car.”After some time, car thieves who think they got away with their crime are caught for minor offences in another part of the country.“When their fingerprints are captured, they match the information we have about a stolen car. That person is then arrested and has to prove their innocence in court.”
