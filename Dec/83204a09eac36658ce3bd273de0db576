She was raised by her stepfather since the age of three. “I knew him as my dad and he taught me that being a dad is being present all the time and that it’s not about blood,” said Makgotso.But then Makgotso reconnected with her biological father. “When I was a teenager I wished he’d reach out to me. But it doesn’t matter that we didn’t have a close relationship. I still love him,” said Makgotso.“We have a lot in common. We were both born in October.“We have a relationship now and we are bonding very well,” said Makgotso, who has forgiven her biological dad.She said she’s happy now that she doesn’t have to choose between the two. “I love them both dearly,” said the young actress.Makgotso is popular for her three recent roles as Onika, Kamogelo in Isidingo and Thishiwe in Isithunzi.She said she was nervous to play Onika because she was worried about how families and people living with bipolar disorder would perceive her role. “I wondered if they would accept it or not,” said Makgotso.“One of the principles of acting is to know your role and handle it with care. You must remember that you are educating, inspiring and empowering.”She was born in Katlehong, and raised in Alberton and the UK. She is shooting a new drama series in January where she plays a villain.“I love playing roles that people love to hate,” said Makgotso.
