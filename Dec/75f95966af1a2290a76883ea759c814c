     Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's nephew has reportedly called for the "forgiveness" of former first lady Grace Mugabe''s allies known as the Generation 40, saying that it was now time for the ruling Zanu-PF party to "move forward in unity".According to NewsDay, speaking during celebrations to mark Mnangagwa's inauguration at Dema Rural District Council grounds at the weekend, Tongai Mnangagwa said that the former first lady's backers for the Zanu-PF presidency were misled. He said it was now, however, time to "kiss and make up" ahead of the coming 2018 polls."All I can say is that there is no G40 or Lacoste. We are Zanu-PF. We are now facing the opposition come elections. These G40s are our children who were misled, but we moved on despite challenges," Tongai was quoted as saying. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss3gnos5ajd_HtBlHUEWH65WWt1nGgX4qFjZeua_r4NBO3c-jZd5wY1WlHHsdesdBwY4UOhehbY7__A0DX_05y4CiqDCYUjhj7av1GKd2xtCVV2b3_7rRRYKg0GRqJx16m9RggzCUURyzJhTZvRMblTVedGXoQmb_BvX-eilFDF9_lqB3oV7XLaUNA-PAx7dj3664c1BWLlztNfMztTK1bxpP7Mcbe69E20vCC2n3Xc3nbks-tFBbw42HgdwUWyEAQLocRLRjTVPzvjhCMGSsDAldWHh2yLsLJPcA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHT1gl9WoNkJEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
