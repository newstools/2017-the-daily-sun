They had locked the gate. I’m disappointed because the nurses should have warned us a long time ago,” said the patient. “I was here on Tuesday and I wasn’t helped because the queue was too long, and there was no notice. I decided to come back today, but I am being turned away. “I don’t understand why they chose to celebrate their party during working hours instead of after work. This is poor service delivery and it’s affecting us. ” Lindelwa Gotyana (36) said: “I came here for family planning but I am being turned away.” Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: “This is not acceptable. “We’ve asked the district manager to attend to this allegation.”
