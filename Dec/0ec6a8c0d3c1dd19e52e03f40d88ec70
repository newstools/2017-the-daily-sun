    Religious leaders cannot usurp the functions of medical professionals when offering faith-based healing, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities said today."It is not for the religious leader to encourage people to bring people to them who are extremely ill. Churches are not supposed to be hospitals; they are supposed to be places of worship," Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, chairperson of the CRL Rights Commission said told News24."We know God heals, yes, but he heals in many ways through doctors."if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvg8McSqDW3OrFdrcB-uNNDo_p09yD1lr6Z4AHug6z-Ub6ntCRPkGITpXQjf_F2yYDDNOY09rogPe8d8HWTRwF5AQocslqsfKrBmKR9r0YSYfNH0o23111Df5GXF81wNc3Rsvm7YjQPU5OO5peVneKxzoP3wFBeku7tWU0B8VFu5vgnjh3kGM1ur6oCfSvb-t3r8Ayl4pAA4ZOGfSgkgDl2W5kDHq3fJI4UEE5ZRpL9n_v2d_fVrMvT5v4vN5SNr-He9yT7vfJM-vMokvpxLMrvLheUYuU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNW7VVJEqXPbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

And the only way we can do this it to treat them like ordinary human beings," she said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/churches-are-not-supposed-to-be-hospitals-says-crl-rights-commission-20171227
