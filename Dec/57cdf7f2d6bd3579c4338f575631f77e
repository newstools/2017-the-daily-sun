    ANGLICAN Archbishop Thabo Makgoba wants the newly elected
leadership of the ANC "to act quickly and decisively" to replace
President Jacob Zuma as the head of state.Makgoba was preaching at the Midnight Mass in St George's
Cathedral in Cape Town on Christmas eve. He said the ruling party, after
replacing Zuma, should follow up with a "targeted Cabinet reshuffle"."I cannot see how two centres of power – one centred
on the party and the other on the State – can collaborate when their values
seem diametrically opposed to one another. I cannot see how the ANC will make a
clean break with the past and set us on a new course unless the new leaders
elected at Nasrec last week, supported by their MPs in Parliament, act boldly
and quickly to replace Mr Zuma as President of the country, and to follow that
up with a carefully targeted Cabinet reshuffle. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyWrl0h_VV13XKYMS4ufnAS6DGnq9q6smdJsReh2PnekzkZbdcTtrKdoT8iWFz3cd9T8hJQ6929CqiPhw-9BIEGLtDhPxx6NFkgAuRJqxTD1vzY0XjWE4VuEbSElhwpW2gOCuYXIaAEUmC97q_UlPuDV9nt2UlTXKGUFQED4wl49VSQkX6VkDv05XXQmDK5jTN9hlYri6LKk3sE8RdjuuPh8wOg7fGkQGbQ20ZsutP-lldN-yJ5W37uVLngUHoLKGSHBeX_qeYByf8X2gdkZdtJNIo5rE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH4E1tRW25L7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

histories of other liberation movements in the world who have failed to adapt:
they will lose power," Makgoba said.He said if new ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa wants his
party to get a new lease of life, he and the new leadership will need "to
cut the umbilical cord which ties them to the Zuma era, quickly and
decisively"."Our economy is floundering, unemployment is rising
and those cohorts of corruption who see they are losing influence are making
ever more desperate attempts to loot what they can before their party is over.
On top of that, the divisions in the ANC have led to a paralysis in
decision-making and the implementation of policy. It is time to say, 'Enough is
enough'."Makgoba said he has told the new ANC leadership that the
faith community will support their efforts "but only on the strict
condition that they must work together to re-establish values-based, ethical
and moral leadership"."Whether he acknowledges it or not, he knows and we
know that means he has to act in the matter of President Zuma," he said.He encouraged South Africans to join the debate on land
and economic reform.Makgoba suggested that after the country's liberation,
"too many of us folded our arms and waited for the government to fulfil
our dreams"."God expects us to stand up, to speak up, to fight
corruption and maladministration. We need a revolution in our thinking and our
being, a revolution in which we use our numbers to promote moral and ethical
values and to bring about the flourishing of all South Africans," he said. https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/archbishop-makgoba-calls-on-new-anc-leadership-to-replace-zuma-as-head-of-state-20171225
