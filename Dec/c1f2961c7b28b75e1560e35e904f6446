Avoid a situation where you have spent all your money on unnecessary items prior to paying essential bills such as your bond, school fees, debit orders, investments and clothes.Put away the money you need as soon as you receive it or better yet, pay the necessary bills as soon as you can. Avoid credit cards or buying on account.Save towards your festive season expenses. Have you ever thought about putting money away each month, starting in January, to save for the festive season? If you put aside R 600 a month from January to November, you will have R6 600 to spoil yourself and your family. Stick to your budget. Prepare a realistic budget and stick to it. A good idea is to keep your receipts and track your spending habits to make sure you remain within your budget. Maximise your bonus. When December comes and you are rewarded with a bonus, be clever.Don’t squander it but rather stick to your planned budget, invest your bonus, or use it to pay off any debt.
