However, social media users were able to retrieve this picture and found it to have been from a 2016 bust where R5m was seized by cops in an alleged licensing scheme in Cape Town. Mbalula later defended his tweet saying “Issue here is not origin of the IMAGE (which is from 2016) but the context of the tweet. “I happen to be the Minister of Police - and you use Google Reverse Search to challenge a tweet that speaks to what is happening now. It’s called image illustration,” it reads.But social media users weren’t impressed with the minister’s response. They continued making fun of him, even questioning whether guns and knives he post are taken from the actual scene.2.5m cash intercepted #VotesForCash pic.twitter.com/EDWM6oz8vl— RSA Minister of Police (@MbalulaFikile) December 12, 2017
