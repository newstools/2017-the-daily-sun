He lacks experience.” Mzoli said Dalisizwe is a seasoned fighter with 15 wins under his belt.  And he has lost only one match and drawn seven. His trip is sponsored by Goal Supermarket. “I’m thankful for the help I got from the store,” Dalisizwe told the People’s Paper. Lwando Dandala, the store’s Philippi East marketing manager, told Daily Sun the store came on board because they are confident that Matlala will make the country proud. “We want him to focus on the match and stop worrying about his financial challenges,” said Lwando. He said sponsoring Dalisizwe is part of Goal’s social responsibility contribution to the community.
