    ACE Magashule beat his much fancied opponent Senzo Mchunu by a mere 24 votes.And now some people in Cyril Ramaphosa’s camp, the slate from which Mchunu contested, are up in arms and want an explanation.So sure was Mchunu’s team that he had won that they didn’t even wait for the votes to be announced.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstb-OvqKqyGZSwqK8RsnWCdpQlYoUGp0Wrdvb5xUxpwtDDi0j9BY07xvEP0palw0eSwv1ErTKVkRgNrSPSuZMIqUIcg76Orf6RzHIXid26o6FN-L56z9157OVsNtT0wGDcp-2pPxZ3bE0-l42FFemuO0xH9_o85qDP0oJ6QSdgYEy9mSyYQw8bvNDmlueqGoOCl4EFHZL8Vdc0-Aj_zsC9SYjxWTPGnRbkRRtDn9uTn0GkgG6xy7RWjCqCpAU-X0aElOBBHK42aAEcBLD-wXL9HHt8Nrr0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJVGG45ZuHCKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But now the Ramaphosa camp wants answers.Mchunu was allegedly in the lead when election head, Nomvula Mokonyane, requested a recount. After that the result changed.A circular by the Ramaphosa camp alleged that Gauteng province raised the issue of votes which had not been counted with deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte. Duarte apparently promised to raise the matter with electoral officers, but never did.The Ramaphosa camp then entrusted chief whip Jackson Mthembu to present the matter during a steering committee meeting. The camp said they were not discussing the abstentions of 68 delegates, but were concerned about 63 votes that were counted but not included.“Please note there might be changes to the position of the SG. There are currently 63 votes that have not been counted and added to the total. “Those votes were declared as special votes, and were sealed in an envelope waiting for the decision of the steering committee before they can be counted and added into the top six positions,” read the circular.“If they are finally counted and added to the votes they will affect the position of the SG.”The matter is expected to be tabled during a plenary session, but EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted that Advocate Dali Mpofu was on standby. This was widely interpreted as an indication that the matter could go to court.North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo advised the Ramaphosa camp against challenging the outcome.“It’s risky to pursue this matter,” Mahumapelo warned.“You would be asked how you knew how these people voted because the electoral process is secret.”He said the vote was the outcome of a democratic process.“You have to accept the results even if they don’t favour you,” he said.“There are people who said they would vote with us, but they didn’t. “We have to live with it.”
