The festival was held at Moses Molelekwa Art Centre at Makhulong on Friday and Saturday.The taste experience started at the entrance where each visitor received a glass with which to taste the various wines on display.A total of 40 South African wines were on display and wine lovers were allowed to buy their favourites or try something new.They were also educated on how and when the various wines are best enjoyed.Scores of people came to witness the event. They were also treated to artists showing their paintings and fashion design to complement the evening.Sifiso said: “The festival was organised to expose people to wine and allow wine drinkers to try new brands.“Most importantly it was to bring wine to the people of kasi so they have an opportunity to experience various options without having to travel long distances.“This will continue every year as people continue to support the initiative.”
