    PLATINUM Stars head coach Roger de Sa is hoping the new owners of the club, who are expected to take over on 1 January, will add new blood.Stars are owned by the Royal Bafokeng Nation (RBN). The club is being sold due to financial constraints as RBN is battling to carry the financial burden of bankrolling a PSL club.De Sa has worked a minor miracle with a limited but willing squad of players at Dikwena since he took charge in September when Stars were bottom of the Absa Premiership with no points after three games.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu9E7FMIsCr8RFEn9yBvxf_jMI_MDdK8j6Nr7b_DphcghxIADKTCicK2jLr0TyV9zbqsvCERqqKvPqIDu5-VCk0lnehVPehLAQ61YpThOlWtUaxY3yLB_hH-NxkDzq232teYln_ktpDEoMvv-7lgm4tN-jPRgnMHCQWd4SIn0N3nTDIAaMklKOepax5JjHBefQRN4gCsTyVcw-rRQ5jBKq5IG4DGKpimqu14buwS_6LCNUAvm2tYZnfUcDXk5m7IlU3oOh9cWncy-Y0I09qE7wvVg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDTm8sRWOlc9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But that’s all I know at this stage. We are all hoping for the best. It would be nice to get fresh blood but we’ll have to wait and see. My job is to coach, not to worry about what goes on in the boardroom.”He stressed that the change of ownership would not affect him or his players.Said the Dikwena mentor: “The players got on with the job. They have really done well. When I arrived after three games we had no points. Now we are fighting and climbing out of danger.“The players will continue to train and give their best, no matter who runs the club. I’ve been impressed by the attitude they have shown and we have managed to get important results in those last 10 matches.“It’s business as usual for me. But when it comes to players coming in, that will be up to the new owners.”
