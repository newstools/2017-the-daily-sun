    BLADE Nzimande is a proud dad!So proud that the former higher education minister took to Facebook to share his excitement.His lastborn son Lunga (27) flew his dad and mum, Phumelele Ntombela-Nzimande, from Joburg to KZN last Tuesday.In a special interview with Daily Sun, Nzimande said for as long as he could remember, Lunga had wanted to be a pilot.“When he was five, we had an opportunity to visit president Nelson Mandela at his Genadendal residence in Cape Town.“Madiba asked him what he would like to be and he said, ‘an airline pilot’.“Even his first drawing at creche was an aeroplane. He stuck to his dream until he qualified,” said a beaming Nzimande.He said last Tuesday was very emotional for him.“My wife and I come from poor backgrounds. We never thought we would produce a pilot. This underlines the importance of access to education and training.”Nzimande said the flight was a complete coincidence. “We were booked on a 12.15pm flight from Joburg to Pietermaritzburg.“But for some reason, that flight was delayed due to technical problems. We decided to book another and coincidentally, it was the one on which our son was first officer.“He was actually flying the aircraft.”Nzimande’s advice to parents is to support their children’s dreams and career choices.“Lunga was determined to attend flight school instead of university. We fully supported him.”Nzimande said after sending his son through a private training school, as a minister he decided to start a programme for black pilots from poor families. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstuNBKguRrGNEu-mWeYdNSp0yTP1WDsrSRs8c-OpKTWp14FSNnj1zrn20t8lkkccoTav9kpXatgBiifazb2M_UGDM54qdCyR12Fjd2yV7IJsW0kq5lIip2HIOhKFB1nep-vmJ87N0yU73qJ-A87btTiQ-wF7tT7plW0BgLav6LqTxu3VqyslG4C_9HaXWMX0VdZZeO2X4vAxRpd-b_HIQL34Mzod_hVtjHWSbRauduHQW2bIeIHuJEjP16uJjmvZQERu9x28abgrMZI4_06XtkYCRf4W-c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJTdRi7S_AGyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
