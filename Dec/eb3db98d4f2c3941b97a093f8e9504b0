    THERE is nothing hospitable about the views at Hospital View in Koster, North West.  Every day, residents face a huge mass of filth caused by people dumping their rubbish there. And to make matters worse, the dump is right next to Koster Hospital.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzdWT8BNatof-4oy9aFUqL6rHaSFYvq7DYlddPFs5YR-8WHLKq8J3rA_qYb-ZIqLFdPk3x3xmmlHAD3TA_aqojwDwHoO2yw8iKvi5uR5SrTb9IsSvQJMQiJ8iKp7H5xws0AoiXAXTIzIl_SdYHKivfd6O8dwu9NaE6AtKd4IsvXiUsgCzf5Hj_wEJvB84AFfvwB6b9TzT31SX7vNs0YDTSaEaVgw8eGcpd7JmyfJdV44iaYSlUBLn0o7MaOA5N23xtpKFrVwNW-5F55cmzLOIrp242glA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCBJ_KThd1bzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The 36-year-old said she is forced to remain indoors with all the doors and windows shut – especially when the day is hot. “That rubbish has been there for over three months now and it’s hell in this summer heat. “I would rather face the heat in the house than the smell outside. Many of us have reported the filth but it is still here.”Kim Medupe, the mayor of Kgetlengrivier Municipality, said: “We have a cleaning programme that collects waste at least twice a week unless there is a problem with our collection trucks. “The community is allowed to throw their waste in the collection trucks. They know that dumping anywhere is illegal.”To stop the area from growing into a huge dumping spot, Medupe asked the community to look out for illegal dumpers.“We have asked locals near the area to watch out for people throwing waste at the spot because what they are doing is just illegal dumping.”
