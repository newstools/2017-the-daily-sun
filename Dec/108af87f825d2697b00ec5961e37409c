    GOGO Gertrude Gumede has been struggling without water for three long years. The 61-year-old from Richmond Farm near KwaMashu, north of Durban, owes the eThekwini Municipality’s water department R8 000. The gogo told Daily Sun her life was difficult as she wasn’t strong enough to carry buckets of water, and she depended on help from neighbours. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuqH7DSFGXFGNDq992kV8oORrCvESmWl_90G_sK57qF3prIp2AfReH-L9SXaEd7ThhEKeWbjFeyKhcOcjwHSGvQbPfVw5p78FsVNGIzlmjvAJFX46rj7FbFwXE0buXVLEje-IVtmXkeKTk8Qpz4CXja9cpWtdK1-9fYw4bcFRNpUiZWhIucNrC1-9WkeMsr3fBVrYFdprdFvKsLWf3nMI2CD_HAH5_iRclhdsY1r1dHp7yIfgwjCELn6Wvv5TO7L1FSsO0xv2YVA0LS4ZJeZacKfKi4NDc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH3FftLOXHV8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Her only source of income is her pension.“There is no way I can afford to pay off my debt,” she said. The gogo said she had not told her councillor about the problem because she never visits the area. “I’ve heard the municipality has the power to wipe clean debt for pensioners, and I’m asking them to have mercy on me as well.”Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa told Daily Sun she couldn’t discuss residents’ accounts with the media. “But as a caring city, eThekwini has a debt relief programme,” said Mthethwa.“Residents are encouraged to come forward to make arrangements to pay off outstanding debt in terms of the municipal credit control and debt collection policy.” Mthethwa said gogo had to visit the nearest Sizakala Centre for further information.
