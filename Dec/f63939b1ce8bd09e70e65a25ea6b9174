    AFTER seeing many shacks burnt by illegal electricity connections, paraffin stoves and candles, a man developed batteries that can be recharged with solar power. Trever Colvelle (26) from Pietermaritzburg in the KZN Midlands said he invented the batteries for appliances and devices to help end fires in squatter camps. With the batteries, people will be able to charge their cellphones and keep their TVs, radios and lights on.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsugxs0tJUOanfZCTmQXvn_3NhrvAPYEITqoSgCICcjlh4CkJzuLxe4P_7vQHNSrf-3BjFNFRH0-LTrnWaKDwzyzjxZEUyROmx4WZg_9_07CdxkbxmUHoPx3t5cIdmcH99L9aOdZbqRbMP2xzAFOPsd4jhIz5M9rZ8bhqmSbfsTdDzQd0eJOmTtMHgF2uVXWPFBjAKrNN4QfCK9UkEYuF7WEuODBKoqV5_FnHIZMbdHcKU0zsH4Gd9QjjvVSZhvQuDOGz98JQCAuSlsmQZ56VFuf-MhD-f0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHMmOWOc8FzYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Trever won R250 000 for his business idea. He told Daily Sun people will no longer need izinyoka as they will be able to use his batteries instead of electricity.“Being selected as the winner came as a surprise to me as there were lots of other people competing,” he said.“I’ve been working on this idea for the past two years. “The next step is to market the batteries successfully.” His batteries can be charged by the sun or by electricity when there is no sun.“The batteries are waterproof.” Trever said he will work on making them affordable because he has Ithala Bank’s support.
