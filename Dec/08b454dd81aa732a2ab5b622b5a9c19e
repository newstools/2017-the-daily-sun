The six officials attached to the station are implicated in corruption and contravention of the National Road Traffic Act.The Hawks seized documents at the testing station implicating the arrested officials.Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said the six consisted of three driving licence examiners and three civilian facilitators. “They will appear in the Ritavi Magistrates Court this week.“We don’t know how much exactly they were charging for a bribe. “We believe we will reveal the complete picture in time.”
