There is no sanitation infrastructure and more than 2 000 people share a single tap for water. The area is plagued by a high crime rate. “This community is part of us and there is no way we can turn a blind eye to our people. We are doing this in preparation for bigger events that will be taking place throughout Gauteng,” said Mlilo.“We are happy with the reception from this community who have welcomed us with open arms. We are looking forward to working with them in the future.”
