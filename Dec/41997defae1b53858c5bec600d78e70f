But they worked hard and finally were able to fight the fire successfully,” said ward councillor Hassan Haniff. He said most of the owners were not present when their shacks burned down.“ It is sad that they will come back to the news that their shacks burned down. “Most of the residents were moved to the local hall.” Resident Bongani Mdlalose (43) said he lost everything in the fire.The eThekwini Municipality Spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa told Daily Sun a resident said the fire started in one of the shacks.“We are investigating the cause of the fire,” she said.
