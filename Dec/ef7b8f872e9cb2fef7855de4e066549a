    BLACK Leopards’ performance will improve under Joel Masutha.That is the view of club spokesman Berry Ramunenyiwa, who confirmed that Masutha was handed the reins to guide Lidoda Duvha following the sacking of Ivan Minnaert last week.Minnaert was shown the door after only being in charge for five games in which he managed to collect eight points out of a possible 15. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstKm8QBSkcBSmSHmJ-zEiBJxB4j-DuPjPXcDMk-i0Lt3Ji82Yuh5jh0YRX3nHNz1v4WV8B9bwJYNm5L1yjnL8mEc_-UPO3JytaAt7pwp4kbimOFoFGx_A3iSjU6ctRzr0X_BsvYmnCsCsZ_KE5-2U8IYm6Qi7an1348VO3o--uKP7YL2XW921P3TERIYFnI0PqJa5KcyTc4UDeNUGA-oFmfoBA9yPaGhTRpSsGdeGF6z-4K-2LA1syAXvC_Tp8KEt-o_6YFRMTGqOXaEZoj\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAB30oyNKv3QEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The first 15 games were not easy, but when things are okay we will win our matches,” said Ramunenyiwa.“We need to fix this situation before it is too late. Masutha will bring change, he has been here before. He is familiar with the culture of the club. “We have been in worse positions than we are now.”Lidoda Duvha went into the Christmas break in 10th position with 18 points. SunSport has learnt that Masutha will be assisted by former player Morgan Shivhambu. But Ramunenyiwa was not able to confirm this. He said: “The board is still looking for his assistant.”
