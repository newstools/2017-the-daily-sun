    Judgment is expected in the Pretoria High Court on Wednesday on the DA's application for an order that President Jacob Zuma adhere to the Public Protector's "State of Capture" remedial actions.The report also says Zuma should establish a commission of inquiry and allow the Chief Justice to appoint a judge for the inquiry.Judgment was reserved in September, where Zuma's lawyer Advocate Ishmael Semenya, SC, said the crux of his client's argument against implementing the remedial action of the report was that it would be unconstitutional to do so.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuONere5MmIO8VBfsOFI7Z0i_WK2pXK8NpG0N12xA8gVDi3i2H4_XSNYk1SvdPMSMHMyMgLrBp2eXziaBtVQAPeDti3o-kBa2FQeLF4y3rql3nq3SZy5ouU53RPNo8pstS9Zif3UPI5Na2Z6yWVKs5C7bsRhWW-b4VLApJIu98QvYJhcxgRuhsBKsbWfZnrnSo3oWi5kdM2YOKe3pktPrM5gIhdjahXsF_Zx9YZFIXE3zzF5I8b1DSYf1jF9YmVEYpAuU6X3vTJqwt66uhaeQ1TzUNK2_U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOzr4NfhwJqGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
