But the garage door was open and the car was nowhere to be found,” said Eric.“The yard’s gate and padlock were also broken. I spotted the shoe prints of four people around the yard and assumed they managed to push the car onto the street.“I’ve never slept so deeply in my life. It’s clear that these criminals used some muthi to make me fall asleep in order to steal my car.“Last week they cut open the fence and stole a Toyota bakkie at nearby Hluvukani,” said Eric.He is offering a reward to anyone with information that could lead to the recovery of his car.Mhala Police Station commander Colonel John Ngwenya said there has been a noticeable rise in the number of car thefts in the Thulamahashe and Greater Manyeleti areas.“It’s unknown why thieves onlytarget old cars such as Toyota Corollas, bakkies and Tazzes. “We’re appealing to anyone with information to contact Captain Robert Khoza on 076 6125 539,” said Ngwenya.
