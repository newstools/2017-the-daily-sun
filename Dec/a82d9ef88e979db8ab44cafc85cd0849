way from a funeral, dragged her to the nearby bushes, where they took turns in
raping her," he said.With programmes for 16 Days of Activism for No Violence

continuing to help secure long jail terms for criminals involved in heinous
crimes, including rapes and sexual assaults.Acting provincial commissioner Major General Bafana Linda
applauded the team of detectives from the Mahwelereng Family Violence, Child
Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) unit for solving the case.Linda said the sentence would send a clear message that
crimes against the most vulnerable would not be tolerated.NEWS24
