    THE suspects were on their way to commit crime last Friday.However, luck was not on their side!Long before they could reach their destination, they were stopped dead in their tracks by the long arm of the law.Police had received a tip off about the thugs’ mission so they followed a white Kia.The cops realised they were on the right track when the suspects tried to flee.Speaking for the Joburg, Metro Police Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said a JMPD K9 squad stopped heavily armed suspects in a car just after 2pm on Friday.“The suspects were on their way to rob a business in Fordsburg but when they made a U-turn on Henry Nxumalo Street, they realised they were being followed.“Officers chased them to the Westgate taxi rank, where four suspects jumped out of the car. Officers arrested three men and recovered two AK47 machine-guns, two rifles and a pistol.“We are looking for the fourth male suspect, who escaped. The others will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court next week to face charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.“There will be an investigation to see if they are possibly linked to other crimes,” said Minnaar.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuD4qWZXwNlpVQAtCI2trEHMhii9hKsKUlvO-PJMV_tGJQATxYsz-oqsZSbC85FGMpV3Bh1XvscOabgwwqClnTiEBgJZxNp-tf1G_4QVrGoIhxOqZ02M6D3xxaMBj0Noafh7bJDKqQdQoxtWJj5683MTfjv-PPe-eMknnw8CziyrwqjndSH8GMGVcXCOKwQIg5m_QO5mEHmnlxrJt4ae1SZsq5awWCgQmJd2DdDeB4dTICHSlZxor_ThRCRQ1uBQHlICIjkwgqeupZ09c-HZDMoqJtV68Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzExqdR2nYa1IEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
