Madonsela had said that a commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture needed to be established urgently. She also said that Zuma was conflicted because he and his family were implicated in state capture, and therefore he should not appoint the judge who would head up the commission. Madonsela recommended that Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng chose the judge instead.Zuma had challenged this instruction because the Constitution gives him the power as head of state to set up commissions of inquiry.Earlier today, Zuma was severely criticised for attempting to stop the release of Madonsela’s State of Capture report. Mlambo ruled that Zuma must pay the legal costs of the case out of his own pocket.
