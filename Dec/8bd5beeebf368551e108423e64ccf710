    JUSTICE Minister Michael Masutha opened a new library at Siloe School for the Blind on Tuesday. The library was built by inmates and parolees who are serving time at the Polokwane and Thohoyandou prisons. The state-of-the-art library has modern devices that will help blind and partially sighted pupils learn with ease. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=564170787&t=artid%3d6f72a15c-0bcd-4660-be45-7bf9fb4332d8%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=564170787&t=artid%3d6f72a15c-0bcd-4660-be45-7bf9fb4332d8%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>He said: “Libraries are essential in promoting reading and critical to improving literacy.” Masutha said the library will be used as a training centre for blind community members. Regional correctional services commissioner Mandla Mkhabela said: “Community projects such as this one are part of our contribution in the rehabilitation of offenders. “They offer us an opportunity to reach out to communities in sending out a message of forgiveness.”Marks Nyoni, one of the offenders, appealed to the community to welcome them when they finish serving their sentences. “Building this library was our way saying we are sorry,” said Marks, who is serving a 20-year jail term.
