I extend my prayers to all roads.“Every year, government releases statistics on the number of people dying on the roads and instead of going down, they increase every year,” he said.“But the ruler is coming and all these evil things will come to an end. He will free us from pain.“Every year, I stand on this road at this time to pray and remind people only Jesus can save us from all our troubles.”Early this year, the department of transport revealed that 1 714 people were killed on Mzansi roads during last year’s festive season alone, a 5% increase from the previous year.
