Ephraim stopped paying the bill and the power was cut off,” she told the People’s Paper.Linda (57) has not produced, released or performed any new music since her album Kodumela in 2005.Sheblamed her husband for her financial troubles.The couple has recently started divorce proceedings and their ugly showdown is expected to be heard in court soon.Linda said what used to be a manager and artist relationship as well as a wife and husband partnership fell apart when the abuse worsened.“I was physically and emotionally abused by my husband for a long time,” she said.She said she was beaten, prevented from performing at events and from collaborating with other artists.“He accused me of sleeping with every walking thing on earth and whenever I tried to explain myself, he would threaten to kill me or beat me up.”Linda said she couldn’t even continue to make music because it was too difficult.“I released my last album 12 years ago and life has been very difficult since then,” she said.Linda accused Ephraim of telling people she was losing her mind.“If I was really crazy and he loved me, he would have found help for me and not left me here alone. I’m the way I am because of him. He has caused me a lot of stress.”When Daily Sun contacted Ephraim he denied all allegations of abuse.He said the reason Linda’s career ended was that they were not making enough money from their music. He said he had a full-time job which made it difficult for him to manage her.He insisted he never abused her in any way.“I advised her to go to music school but she refused and there was nothing I could do for her,” he said.Ephraim then referred Daily Sun to his attorney, Andrew Maoba.Before threatening legal action, Andrew said the couple’s divorce case was heading for the High Court soon.“You are duly warned not to vilify my client’s good name and reputation. You proceed at your peril,” he threatened.Linda shot to fame in the 90s with her album Rebirth, which she co-produced with Ephraim.The album established her name in jazz and more hits like Senanapo, Pula, Kiba and a song for Madiba followed.In 2003, she won a Sama for Best Female Jazz Artist for her album I Am An African.
