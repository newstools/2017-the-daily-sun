    OUTGOING ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe has
admitted that the ANC confronted "threats" that threatened to tear
the party apart, which were heightened by the "offensive" against President
Jacob Zuma.He also warned that centralised power in the Presidency
was "dangerous."This was contained in Mantashe’s organisational report
presented to the ANC’s 54th national conference, which is underway at Nasrec,
south of Johannesburg.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss1Uhjk_luuRIQlFt4Oa6Qxlxw_veaMHmnSKE3JA2oJxIQbFhm_MlSnpkuuw7bAZdJeMxH7LZgP5VmJVAGvqaqCIU4sMIeafx1hBhyS8tGPNW265j9XuOKIB5CZ5NLY3d-dl_ugP0a3JQeFjzI4LaqKo5YU7njL01CDihh7Ve_MGZeEy72TvuccRSAj1-XaD_Hmyx89x1sfVBWUivM2_e7Aq6Y3lSTDaFf-VC8uBvg9S6L5JnI3njgx9zc_EduzG1X7ALAq90InUpyT2JGHKPfxkdduXO8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDOCZ4k4JdmfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

his handling of the Nkandla issue, being implicated in allegations of state
capture by his friends the Gupta family, and growing calls for him to step down
- even within the alliance.  In the report, Mantashe highlighted the March Cabinet
reshuffle that saw three top six officials publicly disagree with Zuma over the
firing of finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.Mantashe, outgoing deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and
outgoing treasurer general Zweli Mkize said at the time that the decision had
been made "somewhere else"."The incident was, however, managed swiftly. It,
nevertheless, highlighted the importance of a thorough going consultation among
officials, as a tool for unity, at the apex of the organisation," Mantashe
said in the report. He said the "incident highlighted irritation with
the exercise of power".The constitutional powers of the president to fire and
hire Cabinet ministers, has been a source of contention within the party, as
Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet three times, without consulting the party’s top six
and alliance partners. His first reshuffle was in 2015, when he fired finance
minister Nhlanhla Nene and replaced him with relatively unknown Des van Rooyen.
Three days later, following pressure from the top six and business, he was
forced to make a change.The last reshuffle was in October, when Zuma fired SACP
general secretary Blade Nzimande as higher education minister, angering the
party and Cosatu.There was a proposal to amend the powers of the incoming
national executive committee to give it powers to recall its public
representatives. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mantashe suggested that
the president should be reigned in, to restrengthen the ANC as "the
strategic centre of power".The new NEC must have the task of putting content into
that, he said."Once power is overly centralised, it becomes
dangerous to the incumbent. Once you allow people around you to exercise power
on your behalf, it becomes quite exciting to lead," Mantashe said. He said the actions of party deployees in government,
were impacting on the party, using the management of the Nkandla debacle as an
example."Anything that happens in government, when ANC is
leading, impacts directly on the ANC. Whether the ANC is part of it or not. If
we say we are not part of it, we wash our hands, we do that on our peril."If departments don’t manage a project in Nkandla
that will impact on us and it becomes an issue, that depends on the narrative,
if we are not generous with information," Mantashe said. The Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma had failed to
uphold the Constitution when he didn't pay back the money spent on non-security
upgrades at Nkandla.The party's handling of the Nkandla crisis, has been
highlighted as one of the contributions to its decline at the polls. It also
prompted calls from within the ANC for Zuma to be recalled. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mantashe-centralised-power-is-dangerous-to-the-incumbent-20171218
