    THE newly elected ANC top six are a mixed bag, which has led to some calling them the good, the bad and the ugly. Former ANC president Jacob Zuma has been accused of turning a blind eye to widespread corruption and some of the party’s new leaders have not inspired confidence that this will end. President Cyril Ramaphosa is the darling of the pack and many have pinned their hopes on him to clean out the rotten apples in the party. Even the markets were excited about his win on Monday night, with the rand peaking to its highest level in eight months. Deputy president David Mabuza has been accused of behaving like a warlord as premier of Mpumalanga. He has been accused of being involved in many killings in his home province although no evidence has been produced. Chairman Gwede Mantashe has been blamed for helping Zuma extend his power base in the party, for flirting with young women, and for the poor state of party branches. Secretary-general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule has been linked to the controversial Gupta family. He has been accused of handing over land worth R184 million in Vrede to the Guptas, and using some of the money to pay for the Gupta wedding at Sun City. Deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte has been accused of derailing attempts to have Zuma prosecuted for corruption. She has been linked to the Guptas through her daughter and son-in-law, but has denied all accusations. Treasurer general Paul Mashatile is one of the few ANC leaders who has long been outspoken about Zuma’s alleged corruption.He has served as Gauteng Human Settlements MEC since falling out with Zuma. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-5aPhg4dTcTTnp9a7m89DDXACa4Gd2j7JGYEOiyHBDCmbXA5s1KBtBnk96SOCMv4QQ1tU8suJBKoFLGzbftFkf93kJ2nU8IBw1d-jS6FzcDW0NVX0u2XTmeQwhh3mx4P0DukpAyuyFNIm96SOsZhpdb3pCzZfVuim333jkz2Lcc4vIwnHglu5OUHz8kl_M097H7eWZKKwz38EcgguoO0irosn5pKhHoxrlZfghC6kKz8hyV_NVE8enABB0lbigRkZJtjkpXrmeC1YkI_etVhSYmVhz8w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJNbGRSK94qGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
