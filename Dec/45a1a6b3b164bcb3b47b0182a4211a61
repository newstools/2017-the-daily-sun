Chief Matsila came to our rescue. “We got the finance we badly needed from him,” said the pastor.Chief Matsila told Daily Sun: “I strongly believe that God is using me as a vehicle to pass blessings on to the less privileged.“I fully support this initiative. Christmas is the time for giving and sharing.“We will always have enough to share with someone who is battling. We want to bring smiles to the faces of the less fortunate.”
