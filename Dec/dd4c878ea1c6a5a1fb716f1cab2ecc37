But the principal at Inzinga said he knew nothing about the transfer. When I went back to Nkabini, the principal told me to sit at home,” he claimed. “He said there were still issues that needed to be resolved.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstA1pu1pOkGuTLBV2kw-pXaX4Dml1akKDkIeCj843OlPt-I9vJ2E-oMzaGryqY8R93eqC9im_cwdCDGuygSvgxDuAFs_Mi7u3ViLKZatU-BKcHG947b-Ios1Pa2b9yPv70ocyd3yHRI5sdfTOV4yyIYfn6PSj4Vx1sA2SxCU4Iu4Naco0E6cajRf5EErdMXdRgjfxQQuabev92FbjUJVpEzR5ie3zHhi_YR_JYgfb3TDNBwKSjJp5VLA0q4dEUy1UMGJklVpjiLapjaS8X6ma3fvbIZi_s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFv-qXkX-lG_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The department does that. If he feels he was treated unfairly, he must come to our head office in Pietermaritzburg for clarity,” said Mahlambi.Majola said he went to the school the principal had sent him to because he thought it was an instruction from the department.
