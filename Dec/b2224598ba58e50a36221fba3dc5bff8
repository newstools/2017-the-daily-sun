According to the municipality, the act prevents councillors who are not elected by political parties to become party members or associate themselves with any party. It said Mdunge was seen wearing T-shirts supporting Ramaphosa and had attended his supporters’ rally in Durban. On Wednesday, the court ordered that Mdunge return to his position and asked that he be back in court on 31 January. On this date, the speaker and municipality are expected to be in court to provide reasons why the order should not be made final.Speaking from his ward 9 office in Makhuzeni, Mdunge said he was relieved to be back at work.“I told the municipality they wouldn’t be able to fire me just like that, because I wasn’t elected by the council but by my community,” he said. “They fired me for political reasons, and not because I had broken any law.” Municipal manager Gamakhulu Sineke said: “Our lawyers advised us not to worry about going to court as they’d handle the matter. “So we’ll wait for them to brief us and advise us accordingly.”
