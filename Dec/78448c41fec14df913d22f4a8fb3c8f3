personal interests and not those of the state or the public,” it said.“Zuma is one individual who has used taxpayers money to
defend personal wrongdoing. He has engaged in
expensive litigation not to defend public interest or even state interest, but
personal. This was so in matters like that of Nkandla where he used
taxpayers money to challenge Public Protectors remedial action that he must
personally pay back the money inappropriately used to build him a mansion.”The EFF called for Zuma to comply with the directive of the
court, and demanded that he waste no time in doing so.After the judgment was made, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said
that Zuma must be personally liable and not the taxpayer.“The courts today‚ they are putting their foot down. It is
the right judgment. We welcome it and ultimately, Zuma must stop delaying South
Africans‚" he said.
