    JUDGE President Dustan Mlambo today ordered President Jacob
Zuma to personally pay the costs of his failed attempt to stop the release of Thuli
Madonsela’s State of Capture report.Mlambo slammed Zuma’s legal attempt as an abuse of the
judicial system, labelling it “completely unreasonable” and “grossly remiss”.Mlambo also was very clear that the legal costs incurred
because of Zuma’s actions should not be for the taxpayer to cover, but must be
paid out of Zuma’s own pocket.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu-5CERgiQaozAAVGoXmoyD-hBvI1J9TIh5r3BJP1yk5uWYb1kvXiyaIG8ipqFJVQp58QwVeiqlRyzzvMOdc2PDaGCFFWsFyN2x3x50XW0BuL9xkeS_ysfFnGyD6wCuanz_CvON-cmsNSBNyCixSRu3ZmlFf8pN_cmH139k3AHLcq5pz5ouK_gwt6XpSfvE2h427MxQTL-rt4sATp8Te4DhITOZcH262Zf6cPR-wVY9kLzDM_9evr2HfDjQ4o7oMmFVr1DQt1TBXwJ3ETI16AU3NvGXIJc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNVfboRd2ROIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

her term as Public Prosecutor came to an end.In the State of Capture report, she sketches the “shadow
state” that has hijacked power and resources from the government and demands that
a commission of inquiry be established to investigate it.
