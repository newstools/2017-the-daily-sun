To my surprise, he fled when he saw me. “I asked my wife what was happening, and she said she had just paid the man for installing the dish,” Norman said. “Then on my wife’s birthday on 15 November, I found them sitting together in a taxi again. “For the second time, the man ran away when he saw me. “I then realised that he doesn’t meet my wife to discuss satellite dish installations,” he said. “I put her through college and built her a beautiful house. I wash and cook for her but she cheats on me. I guess this is her way of saying thank you to me.” Daily Sun called the wife, who refused to be named.“I am not cheating! Please stop calling me,” she said.
