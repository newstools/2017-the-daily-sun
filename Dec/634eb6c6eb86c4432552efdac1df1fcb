This happened after Klip River Taxi Association deputy chairman Muzikayifani Ngobese was gunned down in a hail of bullets. Muzikayifani was travelling with four other people, including his daughter, when they were ambushed. Their bakkie plunged into an oncoming taxi transporting teachers. Seven people in the taxi were killed. In all, 12 lives were lost.“I am optimistic that during this period the associations will find a lasting solution to the ongoing conflict. My doors will remain open to them during this suspension period,” said Kaunda.He said the department had already started talking to bus operators in the area to get them to help. “Bus routes and times have been developed and will be made available to the public.” Sizwe Association chairman German Mabaso said he was happy with Kaunda’s decision. “I hope it’s going to bring peace and perhaps also open an opportunity for us to talk,” he said.Bhekuyise Masondo, chairman of the Klip River Association, said he was not aware of the suspension.
