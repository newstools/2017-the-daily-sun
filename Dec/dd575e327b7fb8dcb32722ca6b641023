    An Irish-based travel curation site that claims "they do all the hard work so that travellers don’t have to", has ranked 50 of the world’s accents.  While they might be spot on when they say "let the arguing begin” - because we have to admit the Irish accent is pretty sexy in its own right - if the results of this survey are to be believed - then that local meisie in the Wimpy ad from way back with the heavy Afrikaans accent saying "I lurve it when you talk foreigner" is most-likely the epitome of sexy to some people's ears.Here are their thoughts on the top 10… Tell us if you agree or not?
