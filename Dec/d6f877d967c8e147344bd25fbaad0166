claims they’d gone to bed soon after and have no idea of what happened to the
teenager.Ivana was a Dutch-Belgian
citizen and her heartbroken dad arrived the next day in Malaysia to identify
her body. He reportedly became furious when he spotted finger-shaped bruises on
her body.The couple have also since
tested positive to drugs.Police had initially believed Ivana had accidentally
fallen from the 20th storey, but are now reconsidering their
verdict. Ivana began modelling at 15 and was a popular figure in
Malaysia’s youth scene. She had plans to further her career in Paris, said the
report.
