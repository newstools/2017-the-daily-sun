We aim to reach the finals.”There will also be five cheques of R5 000 for the Diski Queen of the Tournament, Goalkeeper of the Tournament, Top Goalscorer of the Tournament, Most Promising Queen of the Tournament, and the Queen of Queens of the Tournament. Furthermore, the Diski Queen of the Match in every game will walk away with R2 000.
