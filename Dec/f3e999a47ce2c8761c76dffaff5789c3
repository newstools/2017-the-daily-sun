money by posting footage of themselves on social media doing incredibly daring
stunts. He had about 50 000 followers on the social media platform Weibo.But this time Yongning’s daring cost him his life. The
footage shows him performing on the edge of the 62-storey Huayuan International
Centre building in Changsha city, south eastern China. Suddenly he appears to struggle
to pull himself up, and then loses his grip and falls out of the frame of the
video.Cops said he died when he landed on another building.The footage emerged last week but apparently was filmed
on 8 November.Yongning was recently quoted by The Beijing News as saying: “I’m the most relentless high-altitude
challenger in China, because I do it every day. I’m playing with my life. “It might look like I’m seeking for death sometimes, but
I know what I am doing. I’ll give up when it gets too dangerous.”
