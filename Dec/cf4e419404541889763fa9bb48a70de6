The United Nations Children’s Fund said this year had been difficult for children and sadly, the situation was not expected to improve in the coming months.“I am very concerned about the lasting impact this crisis is having on children,” said Christine Muhigana, Unicef’s representative in the country.“We have a whole generation at risk of growing up traumatised, without proper education, without healthcare and constantly exposed to the most horrific violence.”Half of the five million population in the country is in need of humanitarian support. This includes 1,3 million children. Currently, 20% of the schools are closed because of insecurity. Immunisation campaigns have been disrupted in several regions and basic healthcare has collapsed. In 2018, humanitarian needs are projected to grow. “We are going to need all the support we can get if we do not want the children of CAR to be left to a terrible fate,” Muhigana said. – CAJ NEWS
