The conference has to be peaceful,” he said. “Some things we will discuss are part of building the entire nation.” On Saturday, Ramaphosa and his supporters did the same when he visited the church’s temple in Mtubatuba and asked for prayers to make sure the conference is free of problems.Unyazilwezulu also visited the Empangeni Taxi Rank on Monday at the request of taxi operators.Nkosingiphile Mthembu (41) said the leader was invited to pray for peace at the rank after fighting that happened in the past. “He was here last year. This year we asked that he prays for the spirits of our dead colleagues,” he said. “We believe they haunt the ranks, and that brings unrest among members.”
