On Monday we obtained a court order to stop the city, but they went ahead anyway,” said a resident.People held a community meeting on Wednesday where they discussed the matter with Councillor Betty Ringane.“She said she was not aware of the evictions and didn’t know our houses were going to be destroyed. That’s when we decided we were not going to work and would stage a protest to make our voices heard,” said a man.The mayoral committee member for human settlements, Mandla Nkomo, said people had invaded government land.“The province obtained a court order to evict the land invaders, and it is within their right to do so. I’m not going to address the residents. If they want us to meet, they must make a proper appointment,” he said.By yesterday noon the people were still protesting, braving the rain. They said were not going anywhere until Nkomo and Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile came to address them and provide them with alternative land.
