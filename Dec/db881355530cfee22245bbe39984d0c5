He stood up and walked for the first time in two years.“This is a life-changing moment for my son,” said tearful Angelina as she watched her son kick a soccer ball. He won’t be trapped in the house any more.”She said she did not know how to thank the City of Joburg for helping them.“My prayers have been answered,” she said.Relebohile received the legs on Sunday at an event at the Joburg Metro Centre offices in Braamfontein, Joburg to mark the International Day of Disability. The departments of health and social development partnered with Rand Mutual Admin Services to bring big smiles to seven beneficiaries who were measured and fitted on the spot.The organisation also presented wheelchairs.Gracious Bambisa, its marketing manager, told Daily Sun the partnership would not only enhance the beneficiaries’ lives but also add economic value to their community.Mpho Phalatse, the MMC for health and social development, told Daily Sun she was happy their beneficiaries’ lives would change for the better.Madala Khekhe Mzinyane (64), who was also given a leg, said: “Break those crutches. I don’t need them anymore.”
