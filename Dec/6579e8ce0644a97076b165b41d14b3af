     THE usual search for a "Group of Death"
looks to be a fruitless one as, partly down to the new rankings-based format
none of the "bigger" teams face more than one tough-looking rival.Defending champions Germany probably have the most
difficult of the top seeds as they face awkward games against Mexico and
Sweden, with South Korea the outsiders in Group F.Croatia, debutants Iceland, and Nigeria will all
fancy their chances of joining favourites Argentina in the knockout phase from
Group D. It is the fifth time Nigeria have been grouped with Argentina in their
six World Cups.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstyndiMtA6ZSaeq5Nwzhjr7ynmZdaSPgm_2cbD_aim2eDKVZWp7EV-KvSO4HgWbcQW4cgSh-r0achd-aPu0JX2Hpi4K--dg4i5D4RydcQf6WPw6NGOblNW8gI-Pl0lW3vgSwUWMYERtEw1V-L73a9jj5zEuvsVivcy_P46Qn2g_EvKVIi4uaFZV0DPf8siGqGYb0HOVe5HLylcCJoKHaFstHbzQT7O4qmSvmNXrlYlNa-vfygwoP60GLA2tUS7n1oe-PoIcHE_CCNEOd7pi\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBFTyjQWGsgbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

favourites but little to choose between Switzerland and Costa Rica, who both
qualified via the playoffs, and Serbia.The hosts will be pleased with their group as they
face Uruguay, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, while Group H looks the most open with
little on paper between Poland, Colombia, Senegal and Japan.England will break new ground when they face Panama
for the first time and with Belgium and Tunisia also in Group G, they will
expect to advance. FIXTURES for the 2018 World Cup finals to be held in Russia from June 14 to July 15Group AJune 14Russia v Saudi Arabia, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (15:00)June 15Egypt v Uruguay, Ekaterinburg (12:00)June 19Russia v Egypt, St Petersburg (18:00)June 20Uruguay v Saudi Arabia, Rostov,on,Don (15:00)June 25Uruguay v Russia, Samara  (14:00)Saudi Arabia v Egypt, Volgograd (14:00) Group BJune 15Morocco v Iran, St Petersburg (15:00)Portugal v Spain, Sochi (18:00)June 20Portugal v Morocco, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (12:00)Iran v Spain, Kazan (18:00)June 25Iran v Portugal, Saransk (18:00)Spain v Morocco, Kaliningrad (18:00) Group CJune 16France v Australia, Kazan (10:00)Peru v Denmark, Saransk (16:00)June 21France v Peru, Ekaterinburg (12:00)Denmark v Australia, Samara (15:00)June 26Denmark v France, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (14:00)Australia v Peru, Sochi (1400)Group DJune 16Argentina v Iceland, Spartak Stadium, Moscow (13:00)Croatia v Nigeria, Kaliningrad (19:00)June 21Argentina v Croatia, Nizhny Novgorod (18:00)June 22Nigeria v Iceland, Volgograd (15:00)June 26Nigeria v Argentina, St Petersburg (18:00)Iceland v Croatia, Rostov,on,Don (18:00)Group EJune 17Costa Rica v Serbia, Samara (12:00)Brazil v Switzerland, Rostov,on,Don (18:00)June 22Brazil v Costa Rica, St Petersburg (12:00)Serbia v Switzerland, Kaliningrad (18:00)June 27Serbia v Brazil, Spartak Stadium, Moscow (18:00)Switzerland v Costa Rica, Nizhny Novgorod (18:00)Group FJune 17Germany v Mexico, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (15:00)June 18Sweden v South Korea, Nizhny Novgorod (12:00)June 23Germany v Sweden, Sochi (15:00)South Korea v Mexico, Rostov,on,Don (18:00)June 27South Korea v Germany, Kazan (14:00)Mexico v Sweden, Ekaterinburg (14:00)Group GJune 18Belgium v Panama, Sochi (15:00)Tunisia v England, Volgograd (18:00)June 23Belgium v Tunisia, Spartak Stadium, Moscow (12:00)June 24England v Panama, Nizhny Novgorod (12:00)June 28England v Belgium, Kaliningrad (18:00)Panama v Tunisia, Saransk (18:00)Group HJune 19Poland v Senegal, Spartak Stadium, Moscow (12:00)Colombia v Japan, Saransk (15:00)June 24Japan v Senegal, Ekaterinburg (15:00)Poland v Colombia, Kazan (18:00)June 28Japan v Poland, Volgograd (14:00)Senegal v Colombia, Samara (14:00)Round of 16June 30M50Winner Group C v Runner,up Group D, Kazan (14:00)M49Winner Group A v Runner,up Group B, Sochi (18:00)July 1M51Winner Group B v Runner,up Group A, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (14:00)M52Winner Group D v Runner,up Group C, Nizhny Novgorod (18:00)July 2M53Winner Group E v Runner,up Group F, Samara (14:00)M54Winner Group G v Runner,up Group H, Rostov,on,Don (18:00)July 3M55Winner Group F v Runner,up Group E, St Petersburg (14:00)M56Winner Group H v Runner,up Group G, Spartak Stadium, Moscow (18:00)Quarter,finalsJuly 6M57Winner M49 v Winner M50, Nizhny Novgorod (14:00)M58Winner M53 v Winner M54, Kazan (18:00)July 7M60Winner M55 v Winner M56, Samara (14:00)M 59Winner M51 v Winner M52, Sochi (18:00)Semi,finalsJuly 10M61Winner M57 v Winner M58, St Petersburg (18:00)July 11M62Winner M59 v Winner M60, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (18:00)Third place playoffJuly 14M63Loser M61 v Loser M62, St Petersburg (14:00)Final15 July 2018M64, Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow (15:00)
