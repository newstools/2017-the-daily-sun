municipalities to pay their outstanding R10.7 billion before 8 December."We must make it clear that the dept will not cut water
supply but, may throttle the pressure at which we supply bulk water to ensure
that citizens are provided with the minimal allocation of water, as dictated by
the Constitution," Mokonyane said.She stated that, the ability to build new infrastructure,
maintain the existing and extend current services to achieve universal access
to water for all by 2030 is dependent on the ability to collect revenue.“There are municipalities that have raised disputes with
some portions of the debt owed and to this end, we have agreed on a process to
be followed in resolving debt under dispute and separating it from the main
debt, to allow for a commencement of payment on the undisputed portions of the
debt,” Mokonyane said.
