    BEWARE of Sassa fraudsters this festive season!Mpumalanga Social Development MEC Busi Shiba issued a strong warning to social grant beneficiaries not to fall prey to fraudsters during the December holidays.She said Sassa does not provide financial services such as loans, airtime or electricity.“If any financial agent pretends to be a Sassa official, grant beneficiaries must report such incidents to the nearest police station.”Shiba said beneficiaries must note that the social grant payment is not meant for a luxury life and is also not to be used as a trade guarantee for loan shark debts.“And remember, if you take a loan in December, you will be expected to pay back the money in January.“This will turn the social grant payment into something it was never intended to be,” said Shiba.“Social grants are meant to enable vulnerable groups in society to fulfil basic needs and alleviate poverty.”Unemployed Mumsy Sigowe (48) from Orpen Gate location in Acornhoek, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga claimed she had only been receiving half of the social grant from Sassa for her five-year-old daughter Karabo Nxumalo since as far back as 2012.“I’m only receiving R170 instead of R380 but I’m not sure if my card was scammed or not.“I’m worried because the money is not enough for me to take care of my child,” said Mumsy.Shiba said social grant beneficiaries must not provide their IDs, social grant payment cards or pin codes to strangers pretending to be Sassa officials who come to their houses.“Sassa only operates from offices, and not in unannounced door-to-door activities.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssnAVMYb0tqJfJo7HNvoutOPXcQ_ItR-vhw8R9dJ7-y4l_P6m_k-TYVHyzKL86m8fXvFd_mGgc4oZnpgqbGGw-q46qaOaeXWXSrS35zvjlMIsQ9P5zngqVZ3poTkhIyOAFITh62JB-0aKs_nlRGIYxcJekJAepmdDNcFuheyalqV2PZHwzVOO_ox4tcIvwmhIqUdmMreSXEJ03z2I9vAQNc1vMN_4UAJsX2YPwsGhfu7JZcnd_skmnA0Oht8JauTdQrJJzPmMSlPxfuroztd8YlNC4hPfM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEm17EYVxeH4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
