When they searched the vehicle they found two boxes said to contain R1 million in cash, according to a receipt provided by the driver. The driver had exchanged dollars for cash for his employer, who is based in central Africa.The driver claims the cops took him to the Joburg specialised commercial crimes building in Eloff Street when they allegedly gave R500 000 back to the man and kept the rest.An investigation by the Hawks ended in the arrest of the three on Tuesday.Hawks provincial head, Major-General Prince Mokotedi, congratulated the police officers for arresting the cops.“We have arrested 102 Gauteng police officials since March last year. The serious corruption investigation unit was beefed up with 18 members.“We’re now reaping the fruit of arresting corrupt individuals.”
