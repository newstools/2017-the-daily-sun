    THIS week of Sasol Women’s League National Championships action has proved again that the Northern Cape remains sorely underdeveloped when it comes to football.RC Mills, the Northern Cape champions, are battling to make the grade at the national championships currently underway at Kabokweni Stadium in Mpumalanga.Mills have yet to record a point, which must be a big disappointment for supporters, especially those from their home  province. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuFFd-sYFnklLNHH__4m-Ffwk-aMduEi14lIPpuvBnNp7COju9ph1eN3_uXLoMtIsoCJWWqsmrL-SZFbUzAEYT4iWWYYAuA8k1un5hAo_Bsm3gxl07IecWp7UI2N8A1ZA-JohlKEqJFOS2uTssYUfqO7Iw5YFvJQ0-jJOVxLq2hethyP4ZXouuE_p9DlHYtBmPROxb9euMdzaRCaNIwWg8zkfkcHKXQnlFYdNWlBhCafGCSCJLOmKz-qq6LVqUljMTF6nIpbaet76rdy2F1\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAJDAVkwk8rIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s not like there’s no talent there – Banyana striker Chantelle Esau and former Kaizer Chiefs player Jimmy Tau are both from the Northern Cape.”Esau, who plies her trade for Mamelodi Sundowns Ladies, was also disappointed to see her home province struggle again. She said: “The province doesn’t get the support that other provinces have. I moved away last year to join Sundowns.”This should be of serious concern to South Africa Football Association (Safa) bosses, as this province does not have a team in the Absa Premiership or National First Division either. A question many people may be asking is that if the best women’s team in the province can get hammered 6-0 and 7-0 in the national play-offs, where they compete with the best teams from other provinces, how is the province’s league being run? ) In the 2012-13 season Mamelodi Sundowns recorded a historic victory, thrashing Northern Cape side Powerlines FC 24-0 in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round.
