    STANLEY Menzo will fly home for a Christmas break in the coming days.The under-fire Ajax Cape Town coach would be forgiven if he decides to extend his stay in the Netherlands, however, and not rush back to work.So poor has the team’s run been under his stewardship that the club could be looking to ring the changes in their technical team ahead of the second round of the PSL season to avoid possible relegation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss5zWaO7rfNrR-DAgpMRjSkugu5mAJMfCOj-Gf48WCe7lhGamYQH9OnSul1Ur18eHeQF5QZrOnXm46FDTECknSmKqg-5ZoONoKiUbrQxZXRG-OjSEa74WBYTZdO4Ax7JS-4VpF5mCxYENnNC56aVzrn1yGx5AUHzh43GaiShIU4EsBU5qax4yntbBEol2r-_ld7P45V-Llp2h-kFmYymbABFUu0rfeG0IM5WxwC1Y4mdEkf1oC9_dobY_EG8_FQn018XSfsOPMapW97p2xA_Gw4Hw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKPE5ekWdMrbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

You have to stay organised, remain disciplined on the ball. You have to wait for your moment.”These are the shortcomings Menzo first bemoaned after taking over 14 months ago, and he seemingly hasn’t figured out how to address them yet.Said Menzo: “We have our moments, winning the ball in midfield and then hitting from behind. But it’s not enough.” He lamented his team’s inconsistency but added that inconsistency was part of the league, stressing that his team had to find a way to “deal with it”.Said the coach: “We have to stop being inconsistent. This is a young team with few experienced players.”The Cape side will resume their league campaign with a home fixture against Maritzburg United on 5 January.It remains to be seen, however, whether Menzo will still be in charge.
