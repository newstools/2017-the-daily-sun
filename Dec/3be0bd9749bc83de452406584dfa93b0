    CHIPPA United head coach Teboho Moloi has proved this season that he is one of Mzansi’s budding talents.But the soft-spoken former Orlando Pirates star is not getting carried away about the fact the Chilli Boys are level at the top of the Absa Premiership with Mamelodi Sundowns, Pirates and Baroka FC, all on 19 points.Moloi’s charges stunned Kaizer Chiefs 1-0 with an impressive display at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday, which has pundits applauding the coach and his players.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvKlnwLhLyM5Acc2xDzHjyDjkb3Ex3NfgtUpbf2-ewhl6eLmc8bMKu6OD2Q2w-59vHrZIuX082uLNsMXeUKTo3YyhDfLL1yCZ_Vxwik7EqWKu8ZztClxTQdcT4He3qTFoTbcYvU-hntBTvf_mY61wy7MT3i3vofw4jlzXwYify6doOoZ-emNd8ogvU8wnlTkQlgW71t_meeDxq6wstuEqNqllCfsSlaJ6hZFLLltn5GKEsFPRMwOE-ln5bl7ECjiz10Ta2zdUGi9r6dqEfb\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzN70SD8E4cE_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We should have wrapped it up in the first half. Chiefs put us on the back foot in the second half and were all over us. But we got the three points and I’ll take it.”Moloi has his feet firmly on the ground: “Only time will tell if we are ready to sprint with the big guns.”Ajax have been forced to play their home match at Milpark due to the fact that both home venues, the Cape Town Stadium and Athlone Stadium, are unavailable.The Urban Warriors held champions and fellow-strugglers Bidvest Wits to a 0-0 draw at the same venue on Wednesday.Ajax head coach Stanley Menzo is hoping that having played at Milpark will help his side against Chippa.Said Menzo: “It is what it is, playing a home match away. That is the reality. I told my players not to think about it, rather think we are playing at home. I don’t want to use that as an excuse. It could be but we must not think about it that way. “We know the pitch and that might be an advantage. But we still have to get three points.”Menzo conceded the league was abnormal this season: “There is little separating the top and bottom teams. Who would have thought Platinum Stars and Chippa would have won their midweek matches?“I’m very happy with the point from champions Wits. “We gave a big effort. Now against Chippa, everyone has to give 100%.”
