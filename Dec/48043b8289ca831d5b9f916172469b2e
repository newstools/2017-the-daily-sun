Although the council meeting was held, the motion of no confidence against the mayor was allegedly not included on the agenda.The corruption allegation caused the DA to threaten to break their agreement with the IFP if the mayor did not explain the allegations against him. Lucky Khumalo, ANC chief whip and spokesman in the municipality, said the department’s forensic investigation announcement made them see the light.“This municipality is dysfunctional and cannot deliver services to residents. “We know the mayor is the reason this municipality is like this. “That’s why we’re happy that finally the corruption allegations will be investigated,” said Khumalo.Mbatha could not confirm or deny the forensic investigation.“Please contact the department about this matter,” he said.KZN DA spokesman Zwakele Mncwango said they welcome the investigation.“We have been calling for this investigation to happen because we’re against corruption. “We’re happy now that it’s going to take place,”
