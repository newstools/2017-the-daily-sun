    THE ANC in Gauteng has failed to remove Herman Mashaba as
Joburg Mayor on Thursday night.The ANC's reasoning was that Mashaba is not up to the
task and that he is way out of his depth.ANC councillor Geoffrey Makhubo said it was the
aggregation of the people's power, through the coalition, that had plunged the
city into a financial crisis.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1605639686&t=artid%3d3857086a-fa98-491f-ab16-bbe3e756557d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1605639686&t=artid%3d3857086a-fa98-491f-ab16-bbe3e756557d%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>Makhubo said that the City of Joburg needed "a
mayor, not a successful businessman".The ANC needed the EFF's support to remove Mashaba as
mayor but it appeared earlier in the day that its motion was doomed to fail
when EFF leaders indicated they will not vote with the ANC.EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu said the EFF will not
support any of the opportunist motions of no confidence brought by the ANC in
the Metros."Any rational and sensible South Africa will know
that of all devils, the ANC in its present form is not an option and can’t be trusted
with political power. They must go jump," he said.EFF president Julius Malema also tweeted that "One
thing Parks Tau should get very clear is that he will not be a Mayor of Joburg
again, our respect and friendliness to Paul Mashatile should not be confused
for anything. Maybe someone from our generation and not now perhaps in future,
I can’t commit."EFF's Silumko Mabona also said the party intended voting
against the motion.African Independent Congress and Patriotic Alliance voted
in favour of the motion.
