Sheppard (33) said: “There’s nothing I won’t do for these dogs while I still can, because I love them as much as I do my own children.”When he is at work, neighbours keep an eye out for them.He advised people who want to keep dogs to have a big yard.“Dogs need space to move around. Small yards prevent them from doing that,” said Sheppard. It’s also important to have a fence because you can’t allow them to wander about. That’s when they eat bad food and get sick.” They own eight dogs, one of which is pregnant. Sheppard will take two home when he visits this December.
