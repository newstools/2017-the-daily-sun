We don't want unity to have no meaning."Asked if she would be available for a top position, Mbete said: "I think so."The announcement comes following a marathon first day at the party's national elective conference, that saw the party's programme begin seven hours late, and then stall over credentials.Deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte told delegates during the first open plenary that credentials for more than 5 000 delegates had not been finalised, and business could not proceed until they were.Proceedings will resume at 09:00 on Sunday, as provinces prepare to duke it out over the final numbers allocated for each delegation, following numerous court judgments nullifying some regional elections.NEWS24
