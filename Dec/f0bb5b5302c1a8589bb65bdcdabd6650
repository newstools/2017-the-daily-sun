After I had made deliveries at four taverns, my instinct told me that something was wrong because the car was still following me.“When I got to Pelindaba to do another delivery, they bumped my truck with their car. One of the men came knocking on my window. I’m sure they wanted me to get out so they could hijack me but I kept my door locked. “Luckily, residents came to my rescue. Two of the thugs got away in their car – they only took three bottle of beer from my truck. The other two men were grabbed by the people.” Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said two suspects had been arrested and a case of theft out of a motor vehicle was opened. They will appear in court soon.
