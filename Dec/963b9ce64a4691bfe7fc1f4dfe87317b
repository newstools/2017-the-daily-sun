We looked everywhere for her with no success.” The family now fears the worst because Junior used to follow a simple daily routine, travelling to work and home, and occasionally shopping.“This has never happened before. “We always communicate and when she goes somewhere, she tells me. “Nobody knows where she is.” Gomolemo said the family is frustrated and worried.“My brother and I can’t cope. We can’t sleep or eat, not knowing where she is.” She said they are praying for her safe return. “She is my only parent and has raised me to be disciplined and humble.” She said her hope now lies with SunReaders. “I know many people read the paper and someone may have spotted her.” Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said the police are working hard to find her.If you know where Junior is, call Daily Sun’s Tshwane office on 012 485 9251.
