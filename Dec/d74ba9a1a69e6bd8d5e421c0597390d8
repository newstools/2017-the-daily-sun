I was greeted by a thick cloud of smoke and a huge fireball coming from my bedroom. “I shouted for help and neighbours came running with buckets of water and sand to try and stop the fire.” Her brother, Howard Mnisi (50), said he was bathing one of the kids when he heard screaming. “I rushed and tried to put out the flames but the fire was too strong and spread. We had to run for our lives.”Pastor Robert Mabuza said the fire had robbed the family of their Christmas joy. Councillor Madala Mgwena said: “We are helping the family with food parcels, clothing and bedding.”
