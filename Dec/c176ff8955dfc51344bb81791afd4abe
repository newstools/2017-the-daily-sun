    SUBA Seipubi (38) is one worried woman.While at work, Suba said, she felt as if a snake-like creature was entering her body through her punani.Before she knew what was happening, her appearance changed into that of a man, and her skin became darker.It happened seven months ago in Lenasia, south of Joburg.That’s when she decided to go back home to Sannieshof, North West.But she is struggling to get help from sangomas, who are too scared!“I met a stranger in Sannieshof, who told me that as long as I refuse to thwasa my problems will get worse,” said Suba.The stranger told her she had the gift of seeing other sangomas’ secrets, and that’s why they won’t help her.Her niece Suzan Seipubi (24) said: “My aunt often cries and does funny things, especially at night. She desperately needs help.”Psychiatrist Dr Mayuri Mohanty said Suba should see a professional doctor to find out if this isn’t a mental problem.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuFzefSlyn6dih-hQmF0XqxhW_wowmD-joSJnHr0h5_zi56PDTJvGNmf2U87BEtluzkQ3ZB-_HI9Md8b33D_uFQbTBwxizSJv9WrUIupSNN6gtIFUz6o6tfrVLq7kybJXuDDs4UQUf2pHx_BNnWx1uG10F8BF_icFmSRirTZv3Ce89_l2doDgN-0yFNuy39nWyUEb5TwPGTzEfep0OdWXLH8OB2Vs8Y6vAKaE_PEpsT2ycGUmgw8KQ2KAsu4JD6ljFLe4g3OVeAPv_Ua3vd0IjXWb-ePgo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO2nrgeoAePKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
