But her daughter Pam Manona (51) has lost all hope of finding her dad alive. She said: “At the time my dad disappeared, he was suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure. He had developed dementia. So for him to have survived three winters on the streets is unimaginable.” Gogo Noluthando recalled how he used to cook for her and helped her with house chores. “He never touched alcohol or smoked. I really miss him. When he disappeared, we heard that he’d been found on Main Road in Wynberg. But when we got there, he was nowhere to be found,” she said.Gogo Noluthando said when he disappeared, he had his ID and Sassa card with him.“Ace was well-known in the area because he used to play rugby.” Pam said the family has looked everywhere for their dad, including hospitals and mortuaries, without success. “We’ve even tried Khumbul’ekhaya, but with no luck.” The family said they had opened a case of a missing person at Gugulethu cop shop in 2014. However they couldn’t provide a case number, which made it impossible for police to confirm the incident.
