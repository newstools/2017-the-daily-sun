Then I heard a noise in the opposite empty room. I first thought it was a giant rat. I saw a mysterious black vutha attacking me! I screamed and called my sister.

The fire was too hot and moved very fast.” Another victim, Ntombekaya Mbazawa (48), said: “I was at church in KwaNdokwenza. When I arrived I saw my house on fire and people trying to salvage my belongings. The fire was too strong and wild. I lost everything.“This is the worst Christmas of my life.”Sangoma Zanendaba Mlibo (49) of Chris Hani said: “These families need strong muthi to cleanse them. Vutha likes to attack people when they are not prepared and vulnerable.”Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “They need to approach their councillor who will negotiate with disaster management for relief parcels and see what else may be needed.”
