Then I heard a noise in the opposite empty room. I first thought it was a giant rat. I saw a mysterious black vutha attacking me! I screamed and called my sister. We tried to extinguish it, but in less than 30 minutes the evil fire ate five shacks.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssCEbH0bVWxIKm_D4W_4OneAXjn8Vktkmq3VzYRUP0Gys9ep3P_RkcwUQFVCUUlw2gty0XL2ga2ibPS3EURPhzF0-2R3WwI8oSV9O1m553Jt3O_7VHAiUc5zC60AcZdSQS3TfFkr9k_sSj9hSouLrlrQVQdOp_vDxwDJZawrPqsS44_-JoqTy-QoBIZdX55VXvFGJaWpBZOuc4hYj6KLnlfArbnR7E8-l-1GvXD94tzmHRW7iYPAfQB-72UMFeug8Ee3XeCCXrvg6hfEu9lLiEYiilblq0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMg4ZVmmcnFSEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The fire was too hot and moved very fast.” Another victim, Ntombekaya Mbazawa (48), said: “I was at church in KwaNdokwenza. When I arrived I saw my house on fire and people trying to salvage my belongings. The fire was too strong and wild. I lost everything.“This is the worst Christmas of my life.”Sangoma Zanendaba Mlibo (49) of Chris Hani said: “These families need strong muthi to cleanse them. Vutha likes to attack people when they are not prepared and vulnerable.”Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “They need to approach their councillor who will negotiate with disaster management for relief parcels and see what else may be needed.”
