Then I heard a noise in the opposite empty room. I first thought it was a giant rat. I saw a mysterious black vutha attacking me! I screamed and called my sister. We tried to extinguish it, but in less than 30 minutes the evil fire ate five shacks.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstZ3pJ6v8d8bvxqFi3oBhUK2EbQaeiuwv9W9enqHFhlL0_Ma0KOS36y8wdsV5uaWKV1qZNmcoDH83WsU65ZbXY9vAkB6-d3PvFHaQUVb3H1yjdDqwftr0TOSIL9sjpsC9CwpFHXwCZOEvjBSv5Eqzh3MBkFfOasyNBprBveVqLTPbxc-saif9AnVOLf8SV9e9p4nxUOBXawtTK_OdLjQVvp2RSR1VcYloJ-pdaStOG0ra-qu-GuFVQp8G98-8Cl0jNL5CwSOqO1UU6qQMfS9HuLakd--lM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEG2ZmI-Q2NPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The fire was too hot and moved very fast.” Another victim, Ntombekaya Mbazawa (48), said: “I was at church in KwaNdokwenza. When I arrived I saw my house on fire and people trying to salvage my belongings. The fire was too strong and wild. I lost everything.“This is the worst Christmas of my life.”Sangoma Zanendaba Mlibo (49) of Chris Hani said: “These families need strong muthi to cleanse them. Vutha likes to attack people when they are not prepared and vulnerable.”Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “They need to approach their councillor who will negotiate with disaster management for relief parcels and see what else may be needed.”
