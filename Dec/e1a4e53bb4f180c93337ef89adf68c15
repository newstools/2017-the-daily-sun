Then I heard a noise in the opposite empty room. I first thought it was a giant rat. I saw a mysterious black vutha attacking me! I screamed and called my sister. We tried to extinguish it, but in less than 30 minutes the evil fire ate five shacks.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssI8GxCNWKDQn0A8QfBOJKY9ZgGdKLsOztQa-MgPTXoeRd2gOracZh2AGofv04jbgdBU_pioZHE2OYn8xIbGx4_jj0qqWvliBMZZKZB33uIJlvhxQLIwUBA9n5Umv49TtsVUFLEHhBARhCvUv4stji6d3b3rXKcm7hOep0GWYv8LNOiUS1hxcLagUojVON8ajLsMDhMeYmjk6K7_e1p2_qjbHsQnCTcPj6rsOWxafIUyIqTah5-6584zHC5z4PCRL9mkeE2JNfiJFJCFO0vyEi9tGaj49s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIIHAvJr_QSsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The fire was too hot and moved very fast.” Another victim, Ntombekaya Mbazawa (48), said: “I was at church in KwaNdokwenza. When I arrived I saw my house on fire and people trying to salvage my belongings. The fire was too strong and wild. I lost everything.“This is the worst Christmas of my life.”Sangoma Zanendaba Mlibo (49) of Chris Hani said: “These families need strong muthi to cleanse them. Vutha likes to attack people when they are not prepared and vulnerable.”Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: “They need to approach their councillor who will negotiate with disaster management for relief parcels and see what else may be needed.”
