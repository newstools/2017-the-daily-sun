The man started choking me. Then I then saw Zulu coming through the crowd, and he stopped the guy.” Siki said she didn’t open a case. “I have a sore throat but I’m not badly hurt. “I didn’t see the point of opening a case because I don’t know him and he was way too drunk.” The rapper, who also acts in Isibaya, told the People’s Paper while he was performing his single Intombi Zama Wololo, he decided to pass around the microphone for the crowd to sing along.“While I was passing it around, I noticed one of the guys was choking a woman in the crowd to get to the mic. “I went straight into the crowd to help her and then ended my performance.”After the crowd chanted his name for 25 minutes to return to the stage, he went back on.Big Zulu told the SunTeam he hoped to send the message that women need to be respected and said he would not let a man get away with such an act. “Regardless of how drunk a guy becomes, he has to treat a woman with respect. “We’ve seen so many women experiencing domestic violence. It is up to men to stop it.”
