People said they locked the kids in the shack before their drinking spree.Angry residents are baying for the blood of the couple, who have fled the squatter camp. Resident Salome Mohlamme (34) said they were woken up by screams from the shack.“We tried our best to put the fire out but we could only save two kids, she said. “They had inhaled smoke and they had burns. We rushed them to hospital while their parents were still dancing.” She said after they returned from the hospital they were told the parents were at a tavern. “There, we were told they had just left in a hurry. I’m sure someone helped them,” she said. Resident Mashabela Madubanya (29) said police should arrest the parents. He said they opened a case at Akasia Police Station but nothing has been done.“Witnesses have not been questioned and police have not seen the shack. We are disappointed.” Akasia Police Station’s Constable Matsobane Mabusela said no case has been opened there but one may have been opened at another station.“That station will transfer the case to us for investigation. I will find out why there is no case when residents say they opened one,” he said.
