I haven’t been able to get a permanent job because I don’t have any qualifications. “All the piece jobs I get in the village come and go and as a result I haven’t been able to build a decent house,” he said.Thokozani said he was happy that the municipality had helped them to own houses. “My walls had huge cracks and the thatched roof was leaking. “I had to cover it with plastic to stop the rain from leaking into the house,” said Thokozani.Mayor Thelumoya Zulu told the People’s Paper that the families were identified early this year.Zulu said they asked local businesses for help.“The houses were built by a mining company in the area. “The municipality and ward councillors facilitated the process to ensure these families are provided with decent houses. “They were living in terrifying conditions.”
