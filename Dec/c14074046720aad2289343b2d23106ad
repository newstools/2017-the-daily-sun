We can’t find jobs,” said one of the family, Agnes Maarman.She said at night, 13 of them squeeze on the floor while two sleep on the single bed.“We sleep close to each other so that we can all fit in.”The 12 men and three women from Zandspruit squatter camp in Honeydew, Joburg said they have been living like this for more than 10 years.“Life is hard. We would love to build a bigger house, but we are all unemployed,” said Agnes.Agnes said their late mum, who gave birth to all her kids at home, never took them to the clinic to register their births“Now that we’ve grown, we feel the pain of having no IDs.” She said they were born in Kimberley, Northern Cape and survive on hand-outs from neighbours. Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said the family should visit their local Home Affairs office so that officials could determine if they were indeed born in the country, before allowing them to do a late registration of birth.Mbangwa Xaba, a spokesman for Gauteng Social Development Department, told the People’s Paper that social workers would visit the family to assess their situation.
