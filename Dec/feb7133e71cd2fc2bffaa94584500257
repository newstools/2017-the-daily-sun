I have forgotten some of them because I realised they would not pay me. I did not expect social development to do the same,” said disappointed Richard.He said the actions of the two government departments prove local artists are not given recognition, compared to international acts.“Government doesn’t care when it comes to local artists. “They drag their feet when it comes to us being given the limelight. “All they know how to do is to exploit us, while giving people from outside good service.“ I have to feed my family with the money. “We need to be shown locally,” said Richard.Social development spokesman Petrus Siko said: “A company is contracted to do events and maybe they booked him for the performance. “I’ll investigate.”Rustenburg mayoral office manager Patrick Kgosimore said: “I‘d like him to provide us with the orders he got from the municipality so I can follow up the information.”
