The power utility covered the live wires on Tuesday.In June City Power officials left the bare live wires in the kasi. Residents claimed the power utility promised to return to cover up the wiring, but that never happened.Nono Mdluli (42), whose house is situated directly opposite the wires, said it was always worrying to see children playing there. “I was always calling City Power to fix the problem.“They kept promising to come the next day, but then tragedy struck.” Nono thanked Daily Sun for publishing the story, which highlighted the problems kasi people face every day when they have grievances. “We are always overlooked and that is why we protest,” she said.Another concerned resident, Robert Ranku (47), said danger was lurking at his doorstep for five months.“We were always worried and we did not know how to stop children from playing near the wires,” he said.The parents and relatives of the two children on Wednesday travelled to Limpopo, where the kids will be buried.Despite numerous attempts to contact City Power, the power utility could not be reached for comment.
