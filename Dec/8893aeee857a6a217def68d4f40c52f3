    THE Presidency is not working on regulations for a state of
emergency, spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said on Tuesday. This followed a report by News24â€™s sister publication
Rapport on Tuesday morning that regulations were being drafted in terms of the
State of Emergency Act 64 of 1997, which would give security officials
far-reaching powers. This included the power to arrest people, search property
and cut communication channels, such as cellphones or the internet.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstFJ1hUmEiOXTI7npsgaRVwdOSqKyPr68AUYNIigYJio31rBWWacOqJxqqvjxf28iEKQde1OAAdfrTLZAFe-FatCOiIGgxJZ0NAE8wMZgpphX59vB1MXM7URWHWpVELZEyveKmLdenxPz0Hx_qFA5OCcDPoI8E3wpgi8nQjvd9ojFiy210HOETUeOJ6wqc0WlGq3-XUIFZSoYRravcbE3sZTyazWk3ptLzQ7PqPy-p-y_zuHRvEwyQhK1LAW7LqHpQ9GrDRYlcgr-BwONxIVvYgm0pdAGQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK_dD_cPLgYyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

President Jacob Zuma appointed a team to compose the regulations, reported
Rapport.In a short statement, Ngqulunga said: "The Presidency
rejects the media reports alleging that the Presidency has started composing
draft regulations for a state of emergency."He said a committee had also not been appointed to draw up
any regulations. According to Rapport, the draft regulations declared that no
person may write, publish or broadcast something that could be threatening to
somebody else or their family during the time of a state of emergency. Additionally, members of the security forces would be
allowed to use as much force, to restore law and order, as deemed necessary
under the circumstances.The Constitution allows a president to declare a state of
emergency when war, invasion, revolt, natural disasters or other dangers
threaten the nation's safety.However, it confines a state of emergency to three months,
while preserving certain constitutional rights, such as the rights to dignity
and life.NEWS24
