the crowd did."A group of about 120 persons killed the son by burning
him in the street, not far from where the body of his mother was found
earlier," Beetge added.Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie,
condemned the attack."Revenge attacks cannot be tolerated. One cannot right
a wrong with another wrong. Murder stays murder, and killing out of revenge
will face the same consequences with the law as murder," said Rabie.Police are investigating both murders.NEWS24
