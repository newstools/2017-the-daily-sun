kill Shankar because Shankar was a “dalit”, which is the lowest caste in Indian
society. Dalits are also known as “untouchables” and have the least resources
and opportunities of the four castes in Indian society.For conservative Indians, a dalit marrying a woman from a
superior caste is unacceptable. Such murders are often called “honour killings”,
because marrying a member of a lower caste is seen to bring shame on the family.The couple were attacked near a bus stop in Udumalpet in
central India. Shankar died on the way to hospital, while Kausalya suffered
severe head wounds but survived.Eleven people were charged for the murder and assault, including
Kausalya’s parents and uncle.On Tuesday, Judge Alamelu Natarajan handed the death
sentence to six men.Kausalya’s dad was among those condemned to die while her
mum was acquitted.WARNING: THIS
