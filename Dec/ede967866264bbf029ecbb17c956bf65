    THE protest by newly built Tjovitjo squatter camp residents near Orange Farm, south of Joburg, seems far from over.The protest, which started on Monday morning, was still going on yesterday morning despite the pouring rain.The residents, who had kept the men in blue in action the entire Monday, were at it again yesterday as they took to the streets.Motorists had to find alternative routes as the residents barricaded the roads with stones.The residents told Daily Sun they were protesting because they wanted the land they illegally invaded about two months ago to be permanently given to them.“There won’t be peace in this road until we are given what we want,” they told Daily Sun.Xoli Mahamba (45) said: “We invaded this land because it was there, just vacant. We were tired of renting.”She said she was not employed and had to pay rent of R750 a month.“I have three kids and get grants for them, but the money ends up just paying for rent. I would then be left with nothing to eat and my children and I would starve.“I wouldn’t even be able to buy myself panties,” she said.The residents said that they had a strong message for the police and the red ants.“We are waiting for them. Let them try to evict us,” they said.Motorists were forced to drive on gravel roads as the Golden highway was blocked.Police had their hands full trying to disperse the crowd, which kept on coming back to block the road as soon as the police were out of sight.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said police are monitoring the situation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqd010xbkVYcvjNEIAq2fqpDMKRekNWx8zsMiFZro3MYg03Zgel-nh2aWBBMxzV_FY6-KkgGKz4jJUWsMlW2ThqC0fxucn308TkuILLsaSyJEUibJ8fVDoKJRcvZcAu7-hvXJi8L07xC9RplbFvQAe_x8nr6d7Fw_9-DMRDOkpN9Zx8pikkNBGs6UHOl8M625RmHLHhUoSCyvZaauMwqikLsRecOvT95ZGyzu5_ZWJzrjFc9mWZOBjJb1i71lDkFtT2s6pNOZyYbOdopVO2XK-pDaJgyw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHaaBf3VhIIbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
