It ruled him out of action for nine months. During that time,  Mkatshana missed out on three major tournaments, the 2016 Cosafa Under-20 Championships, the 2017 Caf U-20 Africa Cup of Nations and the Under-20 Fifa World Cup. However, the player made a great comeback after he recovered from the injury earlier this year. His outstanding performance in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge saw him regain his place in the Amajita squad that won the Cosafa U-20 Championships last weekend.“The past year was tough. I had to accept that I wouldn’t get to play in my second junior World Cup. It was a bitter pill to swallow,” said Mkatshana. “But seeing Phakamani return to his best after a long term injury made me believe I could follow suit, especially because my injury was similar to his.”Mkatshana was named Player of the Tournament at the Cosafa competition and was among the top scorers with three goals. The youngster is now eyeing a spot in the first team and a call-up to the SA Under-23s.
