The same month, he drove out with me and forcibly pushed his finger in my punani,” she said.Nomhle told Daily Sun that after she reported him, she was put on special leave. But on Monday she was shocked to learn she’d still be reporting to the same manager!Mercurius Motors managing director Graeme Wood said they wouldn’t tolerate such behaviour.“The matter was thoroughly investigated and addressed according to our internal disciplinary code. We believe the process and outcome was procedurally and substantively fair to all involved.” Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed that Nomhle opened a case at Tzaneen cop shop and that the suspect hadn’t been bust yet.
