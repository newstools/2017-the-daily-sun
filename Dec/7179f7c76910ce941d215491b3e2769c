    THE provincial executive committee of the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal shouldn’t even bother to go back into office after the national elective conference. This was according to members of the party who said they expect the committee to leave office as soon as possible, following the Pietermaritzburg High Court’s ruling on Friday.Judge Rishi Seegobin found that the provincial elective conference this year and every decision taken at it was still unlawful and invalid, as per the ruling of the court on 12 September this year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstazHHyzan1x96PzkWxiMDqF4uzFR241kaVurO8SlpFaxz5lwUo010_Bq-JqjyaSzKutgGN3akBOYoQJ8ZZLOgdKV_pyAZlRfSlY5xPdqzU3iGbLuuMbovrc_m2nIwGa5cXACWjuZ53_H7VAEcOkiunZXNPUWJ-3j5SOdJzVDo2I8p4mVK0nU0huJSaJ_Wgv4p-oyLdasRIuV3m-5EgecdMZb5EewvkUXwZXMN-z1Vlkau45iTftzFOOKnORo8OcZm1FSnJVdHmxDZJ2Qfn1dfEoDB0kWw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGuiYUQGPyFNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

S’thembiso Mshengu, spokesman for the complainants, said they didn’t expect committee members to resume office after the national elective conference.“We do everything according to the ANC constitution. “We expect them to leave office pending the outcome of their appeal,” said Mshengu.He said the court’s ruling would give the ANC the opportunity to judge for itself whether the committee has acted in accordance with the values of the ANC and its constitution.KZN ANC spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said they would discuss the matter after the conference.“We are happy that the court granted us leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court. “We believe the outcome of the appeal will be totally different from the court ruling in September,” said Ntuli.
