and were ordered to stop by the Police but they sped off and a motor vehicle
chase ensued until one of the suspects was arrested at Paledi mall with the
help of backup from Mankweng cops.During the arrest, one unlicensed firearm was recovered.The suspect is still being processed with a possibility
of linking him to the previous similar cases in the same Cluster.  He will appear
before the Mankweng and Lenyenye Magistrate Courts soon and the police
investigations are still continuing.Ngoepe said cops are still strongly urging Limpopo
residents to be vigilant this festive season especially women who are
participating in the Stokvels, to stop distributing their collected money in
cash.
