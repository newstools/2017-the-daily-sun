She beats me up for not getting her white clothes whiter! I have become a laughing stock for my neighbours,” he said.The 26-year-old girlfriend said: “Willy is crazy. He didn’t give me money. He pushed me into the arms of other men.”Spokesman for the Commission for Gender Equality, Javu Baloyi said: “Willy must report the matter at our offices. We will discuss the steps he can take.”
