Morgan van der Mescht (39) is in a wheelchair. He said sitting and waiting for grant money was not good for his health. “As a disabled person, I discovered that many people felt sorry for me. This was not good for me because it made me lazy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss111JOpLxig2O1cE97tkhWaoFUpohY_D3yGwn9xaPv9FJ4kgbjwE-THiYRVyugk1JLg4HJdDTe3lV8CWebt1dWYcWDb43fnezPprWlW0eZ8hmN5ey09t-jE3eZ60VgAOChjezW6VCg5Bige1qkrnwMYjEHViK7KTb_vFB6_nkx88Uu8meVs6iDYXrTb9y3ZM04azEcA_6-FOqrb9Az1IKErF2ugFrx4djyHGqAMXfPwXotp-osLg2RBr0vL3QpHmnlBjmSrHqwEGwWSAxTasKnamEXbw8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFloViS6ym-qEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I added the money to my disability grant,” he said. “I don’t want to wait for government handouts. If I move around collecting scrap metal my body and mind become fresh and fit.”He is helped by his elder brother, Morne.Morgan said: “I wish the government would listen to my plea because I have been applying for a house for many years. I am paying rent for the shack but I want a place of my own so that I can use the yard to store scrap metal and employ people to help me.”Kristoff Adelbert from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said: “There is a waiting list for housing of 80 000 people in Nelson Mandela Bay alone.” But he said he would check on whether Morgan’s application had been recorded.
