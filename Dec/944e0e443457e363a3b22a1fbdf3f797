This was not good for me because it made me lazy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssy_-mGGLdELOR3bKtDXib_TkZ-NMfPp_qJg5Er2CDHLOc_PIpBL4YUBEWZZdFJFXdtmcA_vxzbxhb6v_VD7lytyy32BloO0rENOUUIOKio8cbjP9APMY1CeNGAE-hrUYA7IJwn4h95h6_rV-2oxVshj-WyduOGsiAW4_qglc9v-1-cOTx7CZiOIqi8weheBqAbyJZTKEeKQZ2vxYlwN9aX6h-Clt0OjAufvWRU4G8Zz3P-dW2tLcT2pen38MOoPCOaXpwM0ZtYYorv7fF4NGjRFJxMxyI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIwroC3s6HiWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I added the money to my disability grant,” he said. “I don’t want to wait for government handouts. If I move around collecting scrap metal my body and mind become fresh and fit.”He is helped by his elder brother, Morne.Morgan said: “I wish the government would listen to my plea because I have been applying for a house for many years. I am paying rent for the shack but I want a place of my own so that I can use the yard to store scrap metal and employ people to help me.”Kristoff Adelbert from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said: “There is a waiting list for housing of 80 000 people in Nelson Mandela Bay alone.” But he said he would check on whether Morgan’s application had been recorded.
