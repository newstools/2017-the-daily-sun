Morgan van der Mescht (39) is in a wheelchair. He said sitting and waiting for grant money was not good for his health. “As a disabled person, I discovered that many people felt sorry for me. This was not good for me because it made me lazy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv5XA6R4bfbxMGSxswlWzZkE55HAek7Ueh_YoGdaBeSB1woRTLJyMY6AbLFtw_vohQt16jxrNz-MQ5kodJRRyiluv0tvfgc3_-F2sMGUrIcBybeChaadXJ2bltRfnidkHuWvX4FICyzDah0F5uzu_hpvb_pFySEUyz9YW-Yuos_SuJ3dceZmPSj0k8H-fwRloTAwY9A9j8WaCVqVsZN5uPLAwc6ItUouFO0C3TkoY46kjslFtuAGotRMq-abtqTdQI1ppNuVhRd6binjanADi_5k4ikM8A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFlHwDC1d9olEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I added the money to my disability grant,” he said. “I don’t want to wait for government handouts. If I move around collecting scrap metal my body and mind become fresh and fit.”He is helped by his elder brother, Morne.Morgan said: “I wish the government would listen to my plea because I have been applying for a house for many years. I am paying rent for the shack but I want a place of my own so that I can use the yard to store scrap metal and employ people to help me.”Kristoff Adelbert from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality said: “There is a waiting list for housing of 80 000 people in Nelson Mandela Bay alone.” But he said he would check on whether Morgan’s application had been recorded.
