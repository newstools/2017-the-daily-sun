We will never get over this tragedy.” Tiny said she didn’t believe her son may have killed himself.“I doubt if he killed himself. He was in a happy mood that day and even told his bother that he would see him later. “There’s no way he could have thrown himself under a train,” she said.Constable Nkomozakhe Khumalo of Matsulu cop shop said an inquest docket as been opened.
