She said when she got the news at about 2pm that day, her whole family was shocked.“We’re still struggling to come to terms with what happend. We will never get over this tragedy.” Tiny said she didn’t believe her son may have killed himself.“I doubt if he killed himself. He was in a happy mood that day and even told his bother that he would see him later. “There’s no way he could have thrown himself under a train,” she said.Constable Nkomozakhe Khumalo of Matsulu cop shop said an inquest docket as been opened.
