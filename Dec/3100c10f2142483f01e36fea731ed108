With the experience he gained in the food business he knew it was time for him to open a pizza place in his kasi. He decided to come up with something different because people in townships offer fat cakes, chicken feet and smileys.Yonke told Daily Sun he hopes his business will educate people. “I am trying to show people pizza can also be sold in a township. Some people are scared to have a business in the township because of crime. But our foreign brothers come all the way from their countries and run businesses in the township. “Why it is difficult for us? I am trying to show people that we can also do it. I did not even hire security to look after my property. If I had, it would have meant I do not trust the people of Nompumelelo,” he said.He created job opportunities for Zine Mavata and Velani Basela.Yonke said he is planning to get a mobile trailer or caravan soon. “I am planning to sell in places lots of people gather, like beaches or at music shows,” he added.
