This is because the party itself is held together only by the glue of patronage and corruption, and Cyril Ramaphosa is just a new face to the same old ANC.“He leads a deeply divided organisation which has evolved into a self-serving party that has forgotten the poor and the jobless.”Maimane said the newly elected ANC president had stood in Jacob Zuma’s shadow for years, silent in the face of Zuma’s crimes and those of fellow ANC comrades. “His election means that the corrupt system that is oppressing South Africans will continue.”UDM leader Bantu Holomisa congratulated Ramaphosa. He tweeted: “Congratulations to the newly elected ANC leadership. The task ahead is daunting, both 4 ur org & the country.”Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane welcomed Ramaphosa’s election but warned that much needed to be done to set SA back on the right track.
