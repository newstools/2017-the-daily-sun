We welcome his return after football in Cape Town, and for now we wish him well.”Majoro managed ten starts this season, last featuring at the start of December against Maritzburg United, which was his last game for the club.Since joining from Orlando Pirates at the start of the 2016/17 campaign, ‘Major’ scored 11 goals in 41 appearances for the Citizens across all competitions, helping them win last year’s Telkom Knockout.It is believed that the 31-year-old has begun talks with Absa Premiership Champions Bidvest Wits, and could join the Students in the January transfer window according to well-placed informants.
