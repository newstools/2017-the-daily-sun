The video was shot on 2 September.ANC provincial spokeswoman Sasekani Manzini said they are outraged by Phosa’s claim.“We see these allegations by Phosa as a desperate move to rescue his presidential campaign that died before it was born.”She said Mabuza is protected by the police members, just like any other premier.“He has no personal relationship with any of the people shown firing guns in the video,” said Manzini.The video shows people singing and dancing. Three men are seen shooting into the air with their guns. According to a report by eNCA, the men with the guns in the video are alleged to be Mabuza’s bodyguards.It was reported that Phosa said he recognised the men as ANC members.Phosa was quoted as saying: “That video was shot after a branch meeting recently. “The men have been used to intimidate people.”
