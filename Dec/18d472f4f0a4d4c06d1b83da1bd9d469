    The South
African Revenue Service (SARS) has lost 506 employees since the start of the
year.The figure
was revealed after DA MP and finance spokesperson Alf Lees asked a
parliamentary question in which he wanted to know the extent of the brain
drain, and the reasons for employees leaving, among other things.In a
statement, Lees said SARS had lost a total of 128 people with tertiary degrees,
including one person with a doctorate, and nearly 7 500 years of experience
since the start of the year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuqh8t3POr_PugJNSoSGPAwfy9Zag8xA4dbSEvjIjeEKPvFJ4JCU-zJhLiNvuXmzIN_3DFE6AosFXDflP7TlE8NECOjSpo-pL6JMqVcblMHnyenqF4RyRWBTk7AXsV4SOW4X69Yctbl4PW4foodpfLjctf52WlKrYtdnD_VFRp6soy1e0Z-FOr-L_rU8o_6AAuN5keZ-fa6fgl-VVQnxRCTjdHiTXgkpzhJ3H6ImTejt0Whp163BnRfPosKIx_nce6NJHXiwMp71DWpTdSolbsuz61vVYM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFaxy7iOHSNoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

decay'"SARS
has experienced institutional decay under its commissioner, Tom Moyane, and the
reply confirms this. It also indicates the likelihood of continued
institutional weakening," Lees said."Considering
the critical role SARS plays in the South African economy, serious intervention
cannot be delayed any further. The flight of experienced professionals from
SARS means the revenue service may fail to attract critical skills and
ultimately become yet another failed public entity," he said.The
official parliamentary response indicated that, of those who had left, one had
a doctorate, 15 had master's degrees, 24 had honour's degrees, and 88 people
had degrees.Customer
service, administration, and auditing lost the highest number of staff members,
making up almost half of those who had left the organisation since the start of
the year.Of those
who left, 103 left to pursue other career opportunities, another 81 declined to
offer a reason, and 85 said they had left for personal reasons.Lees
added: "South Africa is facing a tax revenue shortfall of R50.8bn and a
further weakening of key institutions like SARS could possibly worsen the
situation, leaving the 9.4 million unemployed South Africans with little hope
under the failing ANC government."NEWS24
