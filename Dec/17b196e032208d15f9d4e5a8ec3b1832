KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and North West's Bojanala regional conferences.The court judgments have barred more than 100 delegates
from the three provinces from taking part in the voting process. News24 reports that the three provinces were headed to
courts to appeal the judgments, with the North West saying once it has lodged an
appeal, affected delegates will attend the conference. But other leaders have
said this risks the legitimacy of the conference.They have argued that affected delegates should be barred
from attending the conference as their branch meetings were declared
"unconstitutional" by the courts, but if they attend they should not
be given voting powers at the conference.On Friday, allegations of manipulation of the
registration process and buying of delegates to influence the outcome of the
elections were rife. WhatsApp messages alleging that certain party leaders were
changing names of delegates chosen by branches with those who supported their
presidential candidate were also circulating.The allegations and court judgments are expected to be
raised when credentials are supposed to be adopted. A long and heated battle
that could derail the much anticipated conference is expected.
