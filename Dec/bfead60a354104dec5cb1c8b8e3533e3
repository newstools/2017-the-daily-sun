She warned church groups against using overloaded transport, especially during pilgrimages, funerals and weddings. “It’s also wrong for people to block roads during ceremonies.”The MEC said it was common knowledge that reckless driving is mostly caused by people abusing booze and illegal substances.She reminded people that texting while driving is illegal. “We need competent drivers. It is time that we use language that shocks people,” she said. “We need to stop with arrive alive. Drink and drive and die!”
