them were living almost next door to each other.Cop spokesman Esther Mkwanda is quoted as saying: “This
made the ex-husband jealous of the relationship the deceased had with his
ex-wife and the situation got strained to the point that led to his act.” Sitina has been arrested and will appear in court soon on
charges of murder.
