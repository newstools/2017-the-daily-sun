When her body was found, the unopened milk carton was still lying next to her.Captain Eddie Boboko from the Carletonville cops said they suspect the girl was raped and killed because her clothes and shoes were lying separately from her bones.“This is why we are waiting for the DNA results.”Prince Hamnca, spokesman for the Gauteng Department of Health, said they will investigate the delay.
