I was fired on Monday,” he said. “ I am now sorting out my things with them.” Minnaert was only in charge of five Lidoda Duvha league games. He won two, drew two and lost one to Richards Bay FC at Umhlathuze Sports Complex on Saturday, which led to his sacking.Minnaert, who also worked in Rwanda, Guinea, Kenya and Mali, left Leopards in 10th spot in the league table with 18 points from 15 games. They are 12 points behind the leaders, Owen Da Gama’s Highlands Park. The coach admits he is disappointed to have been shown the door.“I was just starting to build a team and beginning to understand the style of football in the National First Division,” he said. “My aim was to fight to help them gain promotion. But things did not go the way I planned. They have their reasons for firing me and I just have to accept it and move on.”Minnaert blamed lack of goals for Leopards’ failure to win games. He added: “Even our star striker Mwape Musonda was struggling to score goals.”He also revealed that his working conditions at the Venda-based side were difficult.“I did not have a goalkeeper trainer or assistant coach to help me with my job,” he said. “In professional football, a head coach needs to have those people around him. You cannot work as a coach and goalkeeper coach at the same time. “Those were harsh conditions I had to deal with.”The Belgian said he loved South Africa and was still hoping to get another job with an NFD or PSL team.
