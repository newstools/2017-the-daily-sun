Rape is a terrifying, humiliating and confusing act of violence against a person. It leaves its survivors depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders which may lead to substance abuse and, at worst, suicidal thoughts or attempts.To all survivors, what happened to you does not change or reduce who you are. Do not give the past power over you. In you is the strength to overcome and achieve.#countmein #plzcallme 083 323 1023, mizzb@lovelife.org.za
