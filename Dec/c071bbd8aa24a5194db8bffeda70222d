THE women vs men fight is in full swing on social media!Young men and women have both created their own Facebook pages to air some dirty laundry – or in this case papgeld woes.The Facebook page for women is called Izinja ezingondliyo– meaning dogs that don’t support their children. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv6AH38GN6PSZIY_L05eC2dfl--I0HESkGGj0S20RoEf9m5zeWgZhyDh_Iaz1g4sL6kKx-AYdkXKRtzFlRWRWW2vUuzd9fIRn165Re5TFWYxOlz3bD1CyyZUUn2OwsZ5Aq0_QyYc5bI-_woqxe5DznfUc9s44MEDxT-1SFz0YxMDaeB5f8FxH70uIjsiaB-Fb0gTYpf6zYDJ-e4y-OgLlEix0WL_GX_GDFpzod_soQB8R2-ABF3CREUA-2H1IU8HjmBrTWDJt_NPak9k9blahbPBsy6kiA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAvrbxx0Dss3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

On the page, women post pictures of the men who they claim made them pregnant and vanished.They tell their stories and commentors criticise the absent fathers.The fathers had no platform to respond as the stories are inboxed to the page administrator, who decides what to post.In a desperate effort to respond, men created their own page. Theirs is called Reason why singondli – meaning the reason why we don’t support our kids.In one story a woman calling herself Nonceba Daniels posted a picture of a guy on Izinja ezingondliyo, with a caption saying the father didn’t even know what his kid ate before sleeping.The accused guy responded: “I was wearing a condom when we had sex but when we finished the condom had rolled up like a bracelet.”He continued, saying he told the woman he wasn’t ready to be a father and that they should buy the morning after pill. “The following day I gave her the money before she left,” he said.At a later stage, the woman told him the pills hadn’t worked.“I then suggested an abortion because I truly wasn’t ready to become a father, especially looking at my financial status,” he said.He said the woman started calling him names and said she didn’t need him.“She said she would take care of the baby herself.”Many more posts with complaints and responses on both pages can be seen.Gogo Mabatho Mnguni (86) asked: “What is happening in Mzansi? People aren’t even afraid of being embarrassed these days!”
