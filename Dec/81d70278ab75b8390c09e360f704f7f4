realising her chair was broken, which led to Black Motion being moved to
economy class."Upon the protest by Black Motion, the captain asked
the police to offload them because he is not comfortable to fly angry blacks,
fearing they will cause 9/11. Nothing demonstrates black hate that this very
statement by the captain because the anger of a white customer is given a new
comfortable seat, whereas the anger of blacks is offloaded as it poses 9/11
terrorist risk," EFF Spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. The EFF called on British Airways to institute an independent
investigation into this situation, headed by an independent body or senior
counsel. Ndlozi said the captain and the crew must be placed under
immediate suspension and face the full might of the law. "Failure to do this ACSA must suspend all BA flights in
our country. British Airways can go fly in its colonial and ever racist
Britain. Whomsoever is white and not willing to treat black people with dignity
and respect must simply leave our country," Ndlozi said.Â
