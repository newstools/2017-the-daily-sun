    PARENTS of five kids aged between four and 10 were
outraged last weekend when cops kept the youngsters in jail for more than 18
hours on charges of theft.According to The
Nation, the drama happened last weekend at a village in Nyeri County, just
north of Nairobi in Kenya. The five kids were apparently bust at about 7pm by
the owner of a private school, Isaac Kihagi, taking a sack of old tin cans and
some metal bars from a construction site. Kihagi then bundled them into his car
and drove them to the cop shop at Naromoru where they were locked up in a cell.When Rose Wangari, mum of one of the kids, and guardian
of four of them, Jaqueline Wairimu looked for their kids that evening the whole
village got in a panic when they couldn’t be found.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvutU9OZ7ML8jB94BTVD4fnc6OvHKSnUmywD2Cyfot_7L4a6hqfz0INHLMqLXeIYXGUvMffPBRcd1JYEBVv5gxiOsqQiWFoDGxuBuXrIn5MyFhDmWuZqyAYvCy-Z2rgM3xlHFcfqKvgvXzreHU3YKeNQFlcMsvlj0ZcuKkr8hRIZpGRCveJTYznSRcRx_GLsSRaZVyam5gnZJFAUmFFPVYcDWksDt93edIX_h3yIWq0zBbr3IyLMRwesZoOAKHvw7z-Ue-ganHNFn9tRgeYQN1jqsxsWmu39UELXA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGhd7kpgO0hGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Nation as saying: “We searched everywhere, even in the toilets at the school
and in neighbours’ homes.”They were just on their way to report their missing kids
to the cops when Kihagi bumped into them and told them what he had done.The two women and dad Robert Kariuki rushed to the
Naromoru cop shop, only to find that the five kids had been locked up hungry
and with no jersey or blanket to keep them warm.The parents were then also arrested and thrown in jail
for neglecting their kids and causing a disturbance at the cop shop.Cop Michael Mbaluku admitted the kids didn’t eat that
night: “By that time they were brought in the food meant for inmates had run
out but we fed them in the morning.” Charges against both the kids and their parents were dropped
the next day.The county coordinator of children’s services, Mr Kung’u
Mwaniki, said the cops were wrong to detain the kids and he will be
investigating.
