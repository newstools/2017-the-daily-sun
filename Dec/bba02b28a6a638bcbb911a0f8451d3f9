It’s something that you develop. Winning is an amazing feeling. “Our players need a win so that the feeling can motivate them to look forward to the next win. “We have performed well, so it’s important that we continue. “If we give the same type of performance we did against Baroka in Polokwane 10 days ago, I think we will get something out of this game. We need something out of this game,” said De Sa. Dikwena held pacesetters Baroka to a 2-2 draw at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.De Sa has plenty of respect for Rise and Shine: “Polokwane are a very good attacking team. I think Rodney Ramagalela has been outstanding and Jabu Maluleke is a fantastic footballer. They have a good and balanced team that has been together for some time.  “We need to concentrate for 90 minutes plus. We need to win.”
