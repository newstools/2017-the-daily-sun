    VALUABLE items are usually stolen during a housebreaking, but that was not the case at Greenfields in Lwandle, Strand, near Cape Town on Tuesday.A window was forced open to gain entrance to the house, but nothing was stolen.Instead this note was left behind on a chair: “Gqwirha ndini lomama,” it read.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsst-u-NAB6TGaOVfJzVYsrMi_Idxap3t1VagLbCgIFfmJJ_a_xtS2LZ7PFNdxqP_fME2eLQqpDffG4KEoHmj8fsQ6zXWFaGbpqaqBciicpUZp-rEpjn9-P1SvQDeD7VXg0ftvCuBURFJzTKHNu3dHgIsS5sGVkmxyPDwa17Cx8R_TIlX7O_gGc3eTqCOj1nAyi0NnX751d3PpRCcOVMvPFoEknfGcYTRid1bysB9ooS_KkhFhntAM8EzyhxLeWXTNNN609J5jXcC5Xf7ObBBM8mlzw1OJk\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLqLIfhXcpqYEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She thought the first thing to be stolen would be the TV, but it wasn’t even touched.“I received a call to say the house had been broken into and asked my neighbour to accompany me. “We found the window had been removed. Clothes were lying all over the place,” said Amanda.The neighbour, Nombuyiselo Ntsizakalo (47), said: “I think the intruder who did this just wanted to send a message to the house owner.”Other neighbours later came to the house. They were all too scared to touch the piece of paper. It was just left there.Ncediwe Cuphela said: “Maybe the person who broke into the house had a fight with the owner and now wants to scare her by using witchcraft.”When phoned, the owner said she would deal with the matter when she came home. A case of housebreaking was not opened.Captain Pieter du Toit of the Lwandle police said people who leave for the holidays can report their absence to the police station.“Housebreaking is difficult to stop because criminals hide when they see a police patrol van.“We will be looking out for people who look suspicious, especially at night,” he said.
