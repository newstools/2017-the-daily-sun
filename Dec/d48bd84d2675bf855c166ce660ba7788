Group co-founder Dommy “Sikilo Boy” Sibuyi (21) said as they were growing up they saw young villagers losing hope and using drugs. They formed Unity Boys to use the time after school to practise singing.“It wasn’t easy as we saw other gospel artists making it in the industry. “We struggled to record due to a lack of money but we worked hard to get cash to pay for studio time.“God has blessed us. Our album has a strong message that aims to encourage people and inform them about things that are happening around the world.“We appeal for a promoter to help us. We perform at funerals and weddings but we need more people to know about us.“We come from a village and need to build up contacts.”
