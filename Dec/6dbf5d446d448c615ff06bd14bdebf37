He got a bursary to study electrical engineering at the University of Birmingham in the UK,” she said.“The delay might jeopardise this great opportunity for my boy. “It’s a pity because all the Home Affairs offices in Durban are offline. “We went to the Commercial Road office in the morning and were turned away. “Now officials at the Umgeni office say we must come back next year. This is not fair.” Ntombizethu Dlamini (39) from Newlands West had come to apply for a smart card ID for her child (17).“It’s shocking that we’ve been told to come back next year. I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it then,” she said.“It would have been better if the problem was announced on the radio.” Cyril Mncwabe, a spokesman for KZN Home Affairs, said: “The unstable system is a nationwide problem.“The department is working on the matter. We appeal to residents to be patient. “This time of the year it’s always busy, so the system gets overloaded.”
