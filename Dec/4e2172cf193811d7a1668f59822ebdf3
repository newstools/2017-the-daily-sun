    A WAR is brewing between squatters and RDP residents in Mamelodi, Tshwane. Angry residents of extension 18 in Phase 2 said their lives changed for the worse last year when people built shacks at Skierlik squatter camp in ward 100. They claimed the squatters illegally connected water pipes to their main pipeline, severely decreasing water pressure to their homes and even leaving taps dry.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstL1vcWQe5q4jqbBu3G_5aoWR6YZRf8fgIajMNKghmGVBkc6TpybzMqwDzkjrNBCNjHrklwK9QKokm9x0fcqILYQOnDoVshymm0E0Xk8UF4kjtGiVnhXMEPPCNIH9K50taKZdLs6QpPn9M0jzpIpg36ds81LE-OEm24F0jaQTZFH3swIQr3TQJdR8qq38YrdNTMSlg0s7KFIVSiWYIYmzHqfgV4nk9Hoc192zOZaziWfDjDrXqIKSh6I56A6p05k8wjGYdcENC-n4DVXJMRb2csBdMHX0E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNZ9TKkoALZCEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
