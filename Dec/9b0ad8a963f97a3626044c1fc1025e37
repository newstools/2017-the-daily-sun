And defeat to Dikwena could see the noose tightening.Komphela said: “I understand the frustration (from the fans). It’s about leadership and when things don’t work, the coach is accountable. But the beauty is that players are working and applying themselves. “I don’t want to get into a situation where players feel the heat. It’s better if it stays with the coach.”Dikwena head coach Roger de Sa, meanwhile, has worked a small miracle with a limited squad, collecting two wins and four draws from those last six encounters. When he took charge earlier this season, Stars had lost all three their first matches.But De Sa will not allow his players to be complacent: “Chiefs are at their most dangerous when they are on the back foot. They always manage to somehow bounce back after a defeat. “We’ve moved away from the relegation zone after that horrendous start before I got here. The players have really been tremendous but there is still a lot of work ahead for us.”De Sa said he had watched Chiefs lose to Chippa and added: “It was not a case of Chiefs playing badly. I thought Chippa played really well and deserved to win. I expect Chiefs to come firing at us. They are not an easy side to play against.”De Sa said he wanted to end the year on 15 points and his target was to get to 30 points.Said De Sa: “We have (Bidvest) Wits away on 16 December, which is our last game of 2017. I want to get at least three points more and end on a high , and then I will be rebuilding for the second round. But my focus is on getting to 30 points as quick as we can and make sure we are clear of relegation.”
