    THE festive break can’t come soon enough for Mamelodi Sundowns. A run of five matches in 13 days have sapped their energy.But the Brazilians will be happiest of the Absa Premiership marathon runners as they head into the Christmas break at the top of the standings with a six-point lead on their nearest rivals. Although their impressive run ended unexpectedly, with a 1-0 loss to Cape Town City this week, Sundowns are sure to have drawn tons of confidence from the gruelling 13-day period.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvsMzoCN1aN9j5J4pB-VrcvTQHvJbMWSMsuLHDjRLGlIwU9RjfKm1MoQQ_NlOq45MnCwrP00xjpY8HYtNQKT9CYFsD_hiHF6XFF5yGypHz9KcylbG9Rw79gSMKecvEGGo-UZwscsOCSIsPmv5I3lch0UL9LUrBOeABNI_zt3cFwxri6ctFHvJjA4eIMUPkDqyaLlUc5KuY_yMdn4kqpg1lRO1FuVF6Hla0iG6mETu2bDvaKaa260q1H685rgsQtozznBLy47KA6X4KFiF2GRwUw6Q\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJB1rWaf1jNoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We weren’t fresh and we played against a well-rested team (City),” said Mosimane.“Defeat was coming. Buckle up, the league race is still long. We are still going to lose, it’s part of football. “Games in hand are always troubling – look at SuperSport United. So the break comes at the right time for us.”Losing always leaves a bitter taste in Mosimane’s mouth. Yet the disappointment of failing to win a fifth successive match hasn’t left him frustrated.“It’s no train smash. We are happy going into the Christmas because we are at the top. You know I hate losing. I take it hard, as winning means a lot to me,” he said.However, the former reigning Caf Coach of the Year can look back on 2017 with pride, having bagged the Caf Super Cup.Said Mosimane: “It’s been a mixed year with local competitions here and the Champions League there.“We wanted to win the Telkom Knockout but it was a blessing in disguise when we lost. It’s not to say we wanted to lose but the loss allowed us to have a nice run in the league – we could concentrate and get that little bit of a good stretch (lead).”The break, however, won’t be long as Mosimane expects his troops back in camp on Wednesday.They resume their season with a trip to Polokwane City on 6 January.
