The farmer, however, was fatally wounded.Police found one of the injured suspects close to the farm. Three other suspects were arrested throughout the night at different locations. "The last one (suspect) was found in the bushes this morning, trapped by the severity of the wound he sustained during the shooting," said Hlathi.
