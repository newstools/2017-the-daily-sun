committee is now meeting over the matter. It is understood this will also be
discussed at plenary, when delegates gather ahead of electing the party's new
national executive committee."Certain things you have to accept to live within
the ANC, even if you are not happy or uncomfortable with certain
positions," said Mahumapelo.The steering committee includes provincial secretaries
and representatives of the party's three leagues. News24 understands that the
votes were counted three times on Monday. A source in the steering committee said about 68 votes
were set aside because of some "technicality". However they were
never put back after the dispute was resolved. Another source told News24 that the 68 votes in dispute
where "quarantined" because those who voted were not on the ANC's
voters' roll but had accreditation.The steering committee will have to decide if the votes
in the quarantined envelope will be considered.Whatever the outcome of the steering committee meeting,
the dispute is expected to be raised at plenary.Following the announcement of the results on Monday
night, a shocked Mchunu was seen walking up to the stage where he spoke to
officials from EleXions Agency, an independent organisation that oversaw the
election process, requesting to see the results. News24 understands that before Magashule was declared the
winner, Mchunu had received information that he had won the election and his
supporters had expected him to be announced the winner of the position, seen as
the engine of Luthuli house. In an interview on News24's Polotiki live broadcast,
Mahumapelo said that should there be a push for a recount, forces aligned with
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who lost out to the party's top post to Cyril
Ramaphosa, would oppose it and if that fails they would call for a rerun of the
election of the top six positions.He said the insistence to look into the results, and
possibly have them overturned, would damage the reputation of both the ANC and
the country."The whole world knows there are results, you can't
now start complaining about things that can be resolved quietly. The image of
the ANC is at stake here," said Mahumapelo.Â https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/if-they-insist-on-sg-vote-recount-well-push-for-election-re-run-mahumapelo-20171219
