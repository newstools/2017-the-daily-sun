    IT IS rare to see a defender awarded a Player of the Tournament gong. Offensive players are usually the ones in the limelight. But that was not the case at the Sasol League National Championships at Kabokweni Stadium in Nelspruit, where Bloemfontein Celtic Ladies defender Bambanani “Juice” Mbane scooped two awards.Juice walked away with Queen of the Tournament as well as Queen of Queens awards on Saturday after helping her side defeat Cape Town Roses 2-0 to retain their title.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvq3YZsNyzv0oca8kj13m_AcnRTKb3F2pYVAyJQzuxt3mUhPiv76I0T5fqPnN-aSR8p1M8jtq0AhhlIZZllHn8UJHC9Sy088gyeRZNx3vRZdbTPXfN2oaD8jASyfNsIWHYQoox6NWblzomgRZStnVMqSEhuMAqoG5tQNdeAfhozneIYQ-uuPW43GInS8YrViePcS2IG0qdOMiEgmXepHV1Ba3Z0Zj88XB1GjFXM2wz7TJ1MVhrxRSXoaFFJDaXosyluQoJ4-a8KuOCh99ep\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP2o-tz9N_sFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Banyana start the year with back-to-back friendlies against Sweden in Cape Town on 17 and 21 January.Mbane’s incredible performance could be her ticket into Ellis squad.Said the player: “From the first game the pressure was on us to defend the title. “We had to be disciplined and work as a team to achieve this goal. I hope the awards will serve as inspiration for other players who look up to me.”Celtic coach Edwin Lesene has set his sights on matching Palace Super Falcons Ladies’ record of three tournament crowns in a row.“I’m so happy for the girls. They stuck to my game plan to win. They are still young – most of them will return next year,” said Lesene.Celtic Ladies have been a presence in the national champs since 2009.
