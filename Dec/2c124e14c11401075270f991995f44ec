They don’t trouble us and we don’t trouble them,” he said.“Instead, they guard us.”He said there is lot of crime in other squatter camps but their place is peaceful.“The dead protect us,” he said.Another resident, Makhosi Mkhwanazi (36), said even if there were strong winds and people’s shacks were to be blown away, they wouldn’t panic because their shacks are well protected. “It’s all thanks to the dead.”They hope not to be evicted. But the commission said it had received shocking and disturbing complaints about the situation.The commission said it urged the municipality to remove the residents of Hlala Kwabafileyo. Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: “Another disturbing thing is that there is a creche in the area and kids play among the graves as if they are toys.”She urged the municipality to commit to specific timeline for a move, because she said the site was never demarcated for habitation.
