That's what they will be quite soon. And there will be a new beginning and new confidence."Speaking to News 24 a laughing Sisulu said: "I have had a conversation with Cyril, I am waiting for him to... go down on one knee and ask, 'will you be my deputy?"Sisulu - whose presidential campaign was themed "It’s a Must" - has accepted defeat in the presidential race after she failed to receive a provincial nomination for the top post. She doesn’t expect any nominations from the floor. However, she remains confident that she will get the deputy presidency position, after four of the five provinces that nominated Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma gave her the nod. Sisulu is going up against Mpumalanga ANC chairperson David Mabuza, who has the most branch nominations for the position, and current treasurer general Zweli Mkhize, who was nominated by Sisulu's home province, the Eastern Cape.Despite Sisulu featuring on Ramaphosa’s slate that did the rounds ahead of the start of the branch nomination process, he made a shock announcement that he wanted Pandor to be his number two. Sisulu told News24 that they have been "talking" with Ramaphosa. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-must-go-down-on-one-knee-and-ask-me-to-be-his-deputy-sisulu-20171214
