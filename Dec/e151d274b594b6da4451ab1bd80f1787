They demanded their money back. “Mike tried to escape but they fired three shots at him, hitting him in the head and twice in the body.” He said the suspects fled the scene in their car.“I called the reaction unit and reported the incident,” he said. “They arrived and stabilised Mike before he was rushed to hospital, where he later died. “The problem is that Mike was from Malawi. No one knows his family.“He worked at the farm and practised as an inyanga. ”KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was being investigated by Tongaat cops.
