A mother and her eight-year-old boy died in the accident and a man also died in one of the other vehicles.”On Monday, three people died in an accident on the R300 when a taxi heading to Eastern Cape collided with a car.Africa said the smash happened near Robert Sobukwe Road. “The driver of the vehicle was arrested for drunk driving.” Africa said four children between the ages of 12 and 14 were seriously injured. The taxi was full as it was travelling to the Eastern Cape for the holidays.Councillor Jean-Pierre Smith said: “The next few days are critical as people head home for the holidays, so I urge public transport operators to make use of the opportunity through Operation Exodus and have their vehicles checked for roadworthiness.”He said the province is doing all it can to make sure public transport vehicles are tested. “As part of the operation, 538 buses, midi-buses and minibus taxis have undergone roadworthy tests with a pass rate of 82%. “The traffic department recorded about 15 000 offences at checkpoints.”
