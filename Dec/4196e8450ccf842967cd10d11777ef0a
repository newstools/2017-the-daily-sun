Refilwe said she had just bought a wig to wear for her brother’s wedding.“I was so excited and removed my old wig to try the new one.“While walking to a taxi rank in Jozi, a man just snatched the wig and made a run for it.” Refilwe said although people saw what happened, the thug was just too quick for them. “I went back to the woman I had bought the wig from but she was gone. I was told she worked with the thugs. “The other vendors told me after selling you the weave, the woman points you out to her friends who snatch it back.”She said she tried to reach her on her cellphone but it was off.“That proved she knew something,” said Refilwe, who paid R400 for the wig. Last month, people at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu, Durban had wigs stolen while enjoying the Ink Hop Music Festival. Some of the women claimed to have lost Brazilian wigs worth about R3 500 each.
