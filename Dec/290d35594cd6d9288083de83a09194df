    VETERAN Bidvest Wits midfielder Daine Klate, who has won more cup finals and league titles than any other player in SA, says winning the Telkom Knockout will be just the tonic they need to turn the corner in their disappointing season.The Clever Boys, who won the Absa Premiership and MTN8 last season, are rock bottom in the league going into Saturday’s showpiece against Bloemfontein Celtic at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium (6pm).Said Klate: “Our league form is a concern but winning the TKO will be a massive motivation for the team. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvhaETE0AOM3ZGAihc-VBaFcdRExPeQWSqmflCv4NOyqsEnvvPWDiJNEb8LlP-b2XQzr57Une6NCLdjT4nw0c7c1-niTqbeTYRZs1WBF4SLo3kVK78kHqbgJ7V-Rqqz0P3FcpafruDjXIh_gALN_Qxhgq5qyIjnvd_TMQ3KuwnBNp1eY092taINLzGaF86vtNbSdCXJMK4cLDu3cJP7NMOMvgs7rnIEsuyX7kzaI4xLNFb1Hp9LYYKBrcuUP5E70lY87X1FQFqA3FuYLL0v\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPpIgMObCjucEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We’ll focus on the league after the final. “Due to the fact that nobody has shown any consistency we can still defend the league title.”Klate (32) said he had featured in “15 or 16 cup finals, winning eight or nine” and was determined to get his hands on the TKO trophy: “When you get older you play every game as if it is your last. “That is how I will approach this final. I will give it everything.“If we win then I will have won every domestic competition twice, the league included! “I’ve won about half the finals I’ve played in. ”Klate has won the Premiership a record six times in a stellar career.But despite being the most decorated player in South African soccer history, he has only played 13 times for Bafana Bafana. Quipped Klate: “I’ve won more cups than caps for Bafana. “That’s the only part of my career where I have failed. But I’ve come to terms with not getting more caps for Bafana.”Klate believes one of the reasons for the poor form shown by most teams in the league is the fact that there are too many breaks: “We have had about six weeks off since the season started due to Fifa breaks and because of cup matches played only at weekends. “We should look at European leagues where cup matches are played midweek after a Fifa break and league games on weekends following international breaks. “Playing three weeks, then stopping for three weeks breaks the rhythm and consistency.”But Klate said players were also at fault: “We as players have to pull up our socks and put in more work at training.”
