the non-submission of income tax returns and five counts for failure to keep
proper books of accounts. This included 18-months imprisonment for failure to submit
income tax returns.The VAT refunds were not based on actual transactions. Instead, Wessels obtained the unlawful refunds by creating fabricated
invoices and shifting money between his businesses. He used a significant amount for his personal benefit, of
which “a significant amount was spent on gambling”.Meanwhile, Wessels was sentenced to seven years imprisonment
on fifteen charges of VAT fraud last year. An appeal against this sentence has since been dismissed. He will serve this seven-year sentence concurrently with the
twelve year sentence handed down.
