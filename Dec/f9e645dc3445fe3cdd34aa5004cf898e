    WHILE most of his peers want to keep up with the Joneses, Morwangwato Mantjane has chosen to live the slogan of batho pele.Morwangwato was elected ANC ward 10 councillor in last year’s local government elections. But in spite of all the perks and salary that come with being councillor, he has chosen to stay with his people. He chose to live by the batho pele principle: loosely translated, it means people come first. Instead of moving to the suburbs, he stays in a shack in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, where he has lived for the past 18 years.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst0DqU4cg5LWVLg3EMWa6zA2YS-w2I81CotVn5JndgMf3IBMj54ZoO0b8x3GlEHxqeJKJgQvViOXbgBL2zevwJI_oIgaohnqS6oA9PpCMtkwYsEXXf20A_qRMEF9yDLiLJsdBSeXlPr0opZXtvHJuvoOei088CLtEldaANEX-zI2pdiwFej9vHtl54EwCxBDuPahoQMbDdGVpnda9mL7_psOZZJ_QcN4C_s0s8LdnGv0T53cjM-VkTlQzpGvUs-WEiOCxziPbVjFVsNFK14smI9dGI83EA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBGAjlHvnj6oEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s ANC policy that councillors stay with the people who elected them.“These are my people and I can’t abandon them,” he said. “They elected me to be their councillor. I can’t just leave them. “I will move from here when everyone in this area gets a permanent place.”His hope is to see his community, himself included, getting permanent stands, houses, electricity, toilets and tarred roads.“Tarred roads would make life easier for everyone,” he said. “At the moment residents struggle to get ambulances or firefighters to come to us because of the poor roads.“Residents are forced to carry coffins over long distances as cars can’t drive on the roads when it’s raining.”
