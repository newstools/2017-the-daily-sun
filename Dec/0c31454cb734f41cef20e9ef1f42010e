I can slaughter it and feed the needy on Christmas. “The prophet will stab the ox. “If I cannot get this ox I will buy another one.”His daughter, bishop Fundiswa Walala (53), said: “My father has many branches but oxen love to visit this church and the one on Stofile Road. They like to get close to holy places.“But no animal or woman is allowed near the sacred altar. “Only bishops wearing crosses over their shoulders are allowed to go to the altar. “It is a sacred place.”
