women’s skirts with his cellphone is now paying for his bad habit.According to The
Straits Times, Jo Hang Jun (33) from South Korea is a pastor at the
Immanuel Mission Church in Singapore. Evidence found on his cellphone shows
that he has been stalking unsuspecting women for at least a year in order to
find ways of filming up their skirts. In at least one incident he found such an
opportunity by standing behind a woman going up escalators.Jun reportedly lurked around different train stations
looking for the chance to secretly stick his cellphone under women’s skirts and
