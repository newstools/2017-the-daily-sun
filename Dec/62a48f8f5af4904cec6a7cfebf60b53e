    A PASTOR who had the strange obsession of filming up
women’s skirts with his cellphone is now paying for his bad habit.According to The
Straits Times, Jo Hang Jun (33) from South Korea is a pastor at the
Immanuel Mission Church in Singapore. Evidence found on his cellphone shows
that he has been stalking unsuspecting women for at least a year in order to
find ways of filming up their skirts. In at least one incident he found such an
opportunity by standing behind a woman going up escalators.Jun reportedly lurked around different train stations
looking for the chance to secretly stick his cellphone under women’s skirts and
