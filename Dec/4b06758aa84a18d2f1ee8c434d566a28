    RESIDENTS are gatvol because the police sit around all day long doing nothing.This is because Leboeng cop shop at Strydom Tunnel, Limpopo, doesn’t have the vehicles to attend scenes or investigate cases.Residents want the police station to be closed as they say it serves no purpose.“People are murdered and cops don’t even investigate.“We get attacked but the cops don’t come to take statements,” said a resident.“This is a useless police station. We would rather take the law into our own hands to protect ourselves because the cops are nowhere to be seen. Where have you ever heard of a police station without cars?”A community leader said the dockets are piling up at the police station and don’t ever get to the courts.“We don’t blame the cops, we blame those at the top. They are aware of the problem the station is facing but nothing is done about it.“We often see other areas being given cars but because we are in a rural area they just look the other way. We are being neglected.”He said when a farmer was killed in the area the cops couldn’t attend the scene.“This is not the only time that cops don’t visit. The local cops feel demoralised because they don’t have resources. They want to do their work but there’s no support from the top cops,” he said.“Without cars how do they expect cops to fight crime?“We basically don’t have a police station.”Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they will visit the police station to assess the situation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu8h1JefOPSNDmxvCXCvxKV8oDkwtC7MKvwZ-EkYGVywrR_hrUSL5-5Yaa2GQMyh4wjZJICcYS6PPVpIQbE11XrTrZ1vW43ItA0AoL5CYe1KjW5YZfY_N1yBRgfPrK07AetXo5rVLQxseg1nCklgObM7Bg-yQkGsj0HE8HxS18IkYUFZkH9K-7e922gv8csJr7ScQOQjVz77mIiTWIa1ux9KA88yIGwsA7KhiDI1Pk_9oKq8AsilT1Cm9tRQZbyhIq3zrE6asiYlaq6L2cc7tZ30pWluv4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF_Q5EVXyMb1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
