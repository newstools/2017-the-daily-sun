But Thobejane believes his charges can still bag the championship despite struggling to win crucial games.The last time Thobejane’s side won a league match was in September when they beat struggling Kaizer Chiefs 2-1 at FNB Stadium.Baroka are now second with 19 points from 13 games. They have the same number of points as the Brazilians, who top the standings on goal difference. Golden Arrows could be the new leaders this morning, however, if they were on the winning side in last night’s league clash with Free State Stars.“We still believe we can win the title,” Thobejane said. “Losing a match by four goals or any big margin does not mean you are a bad team. When Chelsea won the league in England last season, they lost 3-0 to Tottenham Hotspur, but still won it. We are still in it. We have the same points tally as Sundowns, they just lead on goal difference.” Thobejane said his charges seemed afraid of Downs. “I don’t know what the problem with my players was. “It looked as if they were scared of Sundowns. Sundowns enjoyed themselves. This is the kind of game that tests the character of champion teams. But it’s football. “It does not just hurt for the players, it’s killing me too. But we have to accept the result and move on.”Downs’ goals were scored by Motjeka Madisha, Themba Zwane and Percy Tau, who delivered a brace. Baroka now have two games left in the first round, against Maritzburg United and SuperSport United. And Thobejane aims to collect six points from those games before the festive break.“Every game is easy if we just play our normal game and take our chances,” he said. “We do not go to any game for a draw or defeat. We go for the three points.”Baroka’s next league match is against Maritzburg at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday (8pm).
