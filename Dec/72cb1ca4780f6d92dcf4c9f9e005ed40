Swooping down on the area, they found the boys, but they were alone.Motsiri said the suspects were nowhere to be found.The camp was set on fire.Residents praised the police for their good work. Orange Farm extension 2 community leader Mathapelo Tsotetsi said: “I like what the police are doing. They should root out all these fong kong initiation chiefs. “They are messing up our kids.” She said children who return from illegal initiation schools come back corrupt. “I wonder what they teach them there because when they come back they are unruly and disrespectful.” Mathapelo agreed with commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, who wants all initiation schools to be registered.“Then residents will know who to talk to when the child turns into a monster after returning,” she said.
