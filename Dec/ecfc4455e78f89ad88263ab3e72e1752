Moshe said since his gogo died 10 years ago, she had been appearing in his dreams with a key she refused to give to him. She also wouldn’t tell him what it was for. “Last month she talked in my dreams for the first time. She said she locked my 4-5 to prevent me from jolling,” he said. He said he was worried he’d be alone for the rest of his life. He said he last dated a woman two years ago. “She left me because I couldn’t poke. My 4-5 would just sleep.”Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said Moshe should perform a ritual at his gogo’s grave. “He might need to slaughter a goat and ask for his gogo to unlock him,” he said. Doctor Amos Adams said Moshe should consider visiting the Men’s Clinic.
