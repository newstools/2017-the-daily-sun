They had weapons in their hands and demanded the keys to the houses.William Malete, one of the applicants, said when the aggressive group forcefully took the keys, he feared for the lives of the contractor and the municipal official. “The police later managed to get the keys from the group but they then broke the doors and moved inanyway. “I’m disappointed that those illegal occupants are still not out of our homes,” he said.Limpopo Department of Co-operative Governance and Human Settlements spokesman, Paena Galane, said a case of vandalism was opened by the contractor in July last year against the illegal occupants.
