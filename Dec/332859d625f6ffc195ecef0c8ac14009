All that’s left now is for the players to agree to personal terms before they seal the deal.” Jantjie had an incredible spell at Ea Lla Koto since joining the club from Mbombela United at the beginning of last season. He has scored three goals for Stars in the Absa Premiership this season and continues to shine, most recently walking away with a Man of the Match award following Stars’ 2-1 win over Orlando Pirates in their last first round fixture.The Bucs encounter, where he scored the winner and assisted as his cross saw Abbubaker Mobara score an own goal, may very well have been his last match for Ea Lla Koto.Although the Eastern Cape-born player was cagey about the move, he admitted that joining the Soweto giants will be a dream come true. “Every player has a dream of playing for a big team in the PSL,” said Jantjie: “I can’t say much at the moment. I’m still contracted to Stars until the end of 2019. “If the move happens I will join a team where I can keep growing as a player. I want a team that will give me game-time, as I’m also playing often here.”Despite being a standout player at Stars, Jantjie is still not satisfied with all aspects of his game.He stated: “My performance has improved in every game. I have scored three goals and could have done better considering the chances I failed to convert.”
