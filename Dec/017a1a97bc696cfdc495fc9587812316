He was invited as a guest speaker during the live recording of a gospel DVD by Sylvester Mamize held at the Emnotweni arena on Friday. “People should be aware of what they’re good at and know there’s a reason why they were created differently,” he told the audience.“There was a point in my life where I wanted to take my own life.“I hated who I was but realised with time that God didn’t make a mistake by creating a creature like me.” Sibusiso, who has a book called Success Stories Untold, said everyone was made in different ways. “I don’t want to be referred to as a disabled person. No, I’m able. “Today I can proudly say, life is so beautiful, just use what you have and never let your talents go unnoticed.”Sibusiso has 220 medals under his belt, and 160 of them are gold. Sylvester said people like Sibusiso are needed in communities to inspire the youth.
