I have sold some of her most valued possessions to feed my addiction.” He said his only friends are the people he smokes with.“They are not even my real friends. The only time we get along is when we have to sell something so we can buy nyaope. “They don’t stop me when I steal something from home. Instead, they help me sell it.”Phillip said he wants to start an own awareness campaign in his community to warn youngsters about the dangers of drugs.He warned the youth not to experiment with drugs, especially the new and deadly flakka.“Drugs are killing our community. We need to take a stand and not allow flakka into our homes. “All the dealers need to be identified and arrested because they are the root of the problem.”
