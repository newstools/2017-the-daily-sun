    ENVIOUS neighbours thought Nosiphathise Matshayana was building a swimming when they saw workers digging a hole at her home. The 52-year-old from Lwandle kasi in Strand, outside Cape Town, called municipal workers to fix a leaking pipe last month. They came, dug a hole and left it unattended.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvxTtgp6XTEC34l3Zg-l1J9Wv0rQzBqQNa6OzP7bZQ8l7wOEiYF3ByC2rU7jlWqG7P26O-DSdZaVvqU02kzcv6QSPDFht6wewfEoNHmMlB4Rmc8wDamnHSPnijfsIawme24s87XGI9gnNxFY_UxihB60_4vRPgsxYOojX4qMJMeEeTbToJ-sdjY5438XjyfK4bqIZbV6rFzStieuL1C9xHX_t8EKg7G-KPIkvhTxhxM4qsVV1qSp8loxxZ3BdQ33Enw1xVLniNtj3gL14I2VGiWgStAAXA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLQBPhPWO0RHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The hole keeps filling up with water and Nosiphathise has dug a trench to divert the water.Neighbour Mapaseka Mohlokane told Daily Sun: “It’s summertime and I thought she was building a swimming pool for her grandkids.“I later realised this was not the case. Her yard stinks like hell. The smell is extremely unpleasant.”Nosiphathise said she has called the municipal office several times without luck. She said she even sent her children to the office.“My biggest fear is that my grandkids will drown in this unsecured hole.”Mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, Xanthea Limberg said a team of technicians has been assigned to deal with the problem.“In order to locate the leak, it was necessary to excavate part of the ground above the network. “But due to the fact that the area was experiencing reduced water pressure as a result of the desalination connection which took place between 28 November and 3 December, it was not possible to identify the source of the problem.”
