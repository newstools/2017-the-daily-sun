     WITH delivery of water and sanitation a major challenge at most Limpopo schools, Nissan SA has stepped in to lend a hand.On Tuesday a team from the company donated a borehole, water tank and four taps to Bahlaloga Secondary School in Mmabasotho Village at Moletjie, just outside Polokwane.Keba Matlhako, Nissan’s co-operative and social responsibility manager, said the school had appealed to the company by letter and email for financial aid.“After receiving a number of letters from the school, we knew they were in dire need. We decided to visit, to find out what they needed most,” said Matlhako.He said it made Nissan SA staff happy, seeing the smiles on the faces of pupils when they opened the taps and got water flowing.Principal Kwena Mashiane said the school had been short of water for years. “When we got water it would be once a week. Sometimes we’d have to ask community members with boreholes for water for the pupils, which was stressful,” said Mashiane.When Nissan gave the bore hole and taps, Mashiane said she felt as if she was dreaming. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssTMtcaJNVuVA5X5CWYb_JowJv4UlyGlSDTvgzv6BV1z-Q5shFxu0n8YdaUFzAQnODjE3d6rFLCWvUzBUy1DiOQQDDo-ANbx10te71fychvwVGca8Ibyt8VoN5s-_0bD1g4Jwv46-mCPfggBn_3dFYIBgzIiMwXlzdjXHbn6rpWaNgyw5veoyxxS3NHEjtt5b8nRWkpJj1mdz7_ZODHFfOY7NlHWx_TKA_noqIx0D5DAsNI_holkqw8Fkaa5O_GOr7aveUEKv7WVcDjAW5INP_X9WF82mo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAVDuGDwwDbMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
