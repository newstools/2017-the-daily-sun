suspects and locking them up over weekends, insisted that Pauw and Myburgh
present themselves at his office this week to be charged.Pauw said the decision to remove the case from Durban North
is a vindication for investigative journalists in South Africa and hopefully
marks the start of an era of more transparency on the part of the authorities. ''Now we call on the prosecuting authorities and police to
investigate the substance of the allegations in books such as mine and
Myburgh's, and the #GuptaLeaks stories rather than preferring to shoot the
messenger."News24 editor Adriaan Basson said he was extremely relieved
at the news that Govender was removed from the case."It was clear to us from the start that Govenderâ€™s
intention was to intimidate us, nothing else. We do not regard ourselves as
journalists as being above the law and will fully cooperate with a legitimate
investigation. Naturally, we will keep on fighting this case against Myburgh
and Pauw, as we believe it undermines the freedom of investigative journalists
to execute their constitutionally protected duties."NEWS24
