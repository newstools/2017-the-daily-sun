    ORLANDO Pirates don’t need to go in search of goal-scorers – players just need to take their time in the box.That is the view of Bucs legend John Moeti, who says there is no need for the Soweto giants’ head coach Milutin Sredojevic to  sign a prolific goal-scorer when the transfer window opens in January.The scoring problem is easy to solve, the 50-year-old former Bafana Bafana midfielder insists: “Our players just need to stop being in a hurry inside the box.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVxrcSQLO-D5sDCmXRKxQ5SqXhNAg6SZunQZxWDOUlRXZLpNt2X-Kg0rjjuid881-xC4l67R79wX-CA0s8_mp8J36b7NFMuo1VbVzagfyOKcTTZlEenV1hESXniLhDbtuZCRsLNv5ldar9cF3J563-onwWVAW3G43dVNmUYtT_FLk1ZOZ666kwkgprcYFCsUgg4p0bKCrptmwE4i60PhXeOa7FcuYKf36esUIIwSHKdH2oRDWCL69MtGsaekiZeLwZyFl0n_bvi1zFfXyTtfswHg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOLfYN-0-_t8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

This has given their Serbian mentor sleepless nights.All four Absa Premiership matches Pirates have won this season were won by a one-goal margin. They have scored only 11 goals in 15 matches.Bucs are sixth in the league table with 20 points, eight points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Pirates’ trusted striker and leading scorer, Thamsanqa Gabuza, has scored only three goals so far.Said Moeti: “They need to be patient. I enjoy watching them play but they lack composure. If the coach works on this, we will start scoring.”The former Bucs skipper stressed that a new striker might take long to get comfortable in Sredojevic’s system, which could frustrate fans. “We can sign a striker but I strongly believe the squad we have has quality and confidence to win games.”Moeti, who won the Caf Champions League with Pirates in 1995, added: “When you hurry in the box, you get in each other’s way. Players are showing commitment, which gives me hope that they will soon find the back of the net regularly.” The legend is concerned about Bucs’ leaky defence. “The coach must work on his defence that leaks soft goals,” he said. “Defenders are making mistakes that cost us points.”
