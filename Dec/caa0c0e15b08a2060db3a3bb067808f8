They dug in front of the gate, as well as behind and in front of the home’s back room, and in every corner in the yard.Buried in front of the yard were nails, while at the back the sangoma found dog and hyena bones and skulls, as well as the head and hooves of a recently slaughtered goat.A bottle with muthi was unearthed, as well as candles and tubs of Vaseline.The family was shocked and relieved at the same time. Patricia said in 2003 she started being strangled by the creature at night.“It would arrive at midnight and start by walking on the roof before strangling me. My feet would just be sore each time I walked into the yard.“My children couldn’t get jobs and my husband always is sick. “The sangoma has told us someone wants us out of this house. “I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,” she said.Patricia’s husband Livingstone Solundwana (70) said it was a relief for him, while their son Loyiso (36) said he had to flee his room and sleep in the living room.“When it was late, it was hard for me because the creature gripped my throat and really strangled me.”Dabulamanzi said the muthi found in the yard is meant to put the family to sleep. “The hyena bones are used for witchcraft, while the goat is used to blind them and keep them from getting help. “A goat is a silent creature as it doesn’t make a noise. “Their pleas were meant not to be heard.” Dabulamanzi said the next step for the family was to be cleansed in the river.
