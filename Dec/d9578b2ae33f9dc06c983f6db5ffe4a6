    The
National Council of Provinces (NCOP) today passed the tax on sugary drinks,
which is part of the Rates and Monetary Amounts and Revenue Law Amendment Bill.This marks
the end of 18 months of negotiations on the tax that included four public
hearings and a negotiation process in Nedlac. The tax, due to be implemented on
1 April 2018, will see the price of a can of Coca Cola increase by around 11%.“We applaud
Members of Parliament for putting the health of millions of South Africans
before the narrow interests of the beverage and sugar industries,” said Tracey
Malawana, coordinator of the Healthy Living Alliance (HEALA).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=223117904&t=artid%3d05702d3b-6fca-4ee8-b07f-bd41d50a0e73%26accreditation%3dhealth24%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Success/Health&sz=300x250&c=223117904&t=artid%3d05702d3b-6fca-4ee8-b07f-bd41d50a0e73%26accreditation%3dhealth24%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>“Thanks to
Treasury and MPs, South Africa is on the right path to reverse the alarming
numbers of diabetes cases and other NCDs associated with obesity. We now look
to the President to sign this important law without delay. “Initially
Treasury proposed a tax of around 20% on a can of Coca Cola. The current tax
will levy 2.1 cents per gram of sugar on all sweetened drinks, with the first
4g of sugar per 100ml exempt as an incentive to encourage industry to
reformulate its drinks to reduce their sugar content. South
Africans are among the top 10 consumers of sugary drinks in the world, and
research has shown that drinking just one sugary fizzy drink a day increases
ones' chance of being overweight by 27% for adults and 55% for children.
Diabetes alone claimed more than 25 000 lives in 2015, and public health
facilities reported seeing 10 000 new diabetes cases every month last year.“While the
tax is a victory for public health, it is around 11% on a can and we would like
it to be strengthened to 20% to really deter people,” said Malawana. “We will
also be monitoring how the proceeds of the tax are used to ensure that
government uses the money for health promotion.”Over 30
countries worldwide are taxing sugary drinks, and South Africa joins Portugal,
India, Saudi Arabia and Thailand who have passed similar taxes this year.Health24
