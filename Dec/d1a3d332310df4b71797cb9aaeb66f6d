If you keep a lot of possessions in the garage, don’t leave the door open. -  Consider a dog: All the clichés are true – having a dog on patrol at your house, especially one prone to barking at strangers, typically makes yours a less than appealing target for burglars.- Don’t leave notes on your doors, not even for friends, neighbours and family.BEFORE LEAVING YOUR HOUSE- Make sure all shrubs and trees are trimmed back so that they do not allow a burglar to conceal himself. - Don’t stop your security awareness at the outside walls of your house. In general, don’t leave anything around the yard that might help a burglar get into your house. Ladders, stackable boxes or any garden tools should be put away, preferably in a locked cabinet.
