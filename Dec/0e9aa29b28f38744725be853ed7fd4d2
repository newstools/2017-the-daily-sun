His sister Cikizwa Madlolo (29) said: “When it was just a pimple, the doctors at the clinic said it would heal soon. “They should have noticed it was not healing and done something to help him. “Last year we took him to Worcester Hospital, where doctors told him he has cancer. Our wish is for someone to help him with an operation.”Western Cape Health spokeswoman Zimkhitha Mqutheni said: “The department is doing everything it can to get to the bottom of what happened when the patient was at De Doorns Clinic.”
