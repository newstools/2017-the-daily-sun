These activities were aimed at improving the kids’ understanding of the environment. It is also part of their natural science curriculum. The children were enthusiastic about cleaning the river and filled 110 refuse bags with rubbish.Event organiser Alexander Frost said: “After a month of preparations, we are happy with the way things turned out. “The children enjoyed the day’s activities.“We are making progress in our mission to create a strong understanding of the environment among young people.” Telkom partners with several landowners and communities near Jukskei River for the 10km cycling challenge. Tanya Harford, director of the cycling challenge, said: “A big part of the appeal of mountain biking is the opportunity to be around Mother Nature. “Keeping our environment clean and teaching kids to appreciate water is something that is close to our hearts.“We try to uplift the communities we work with. “This project not only left the river banks around Diepsloot cleaner, but also had a positive impact on a number of children from the neighbourhood.”
