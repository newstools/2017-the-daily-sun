    THERE is no “December double” for Sassa beneficiaries, nor will January grants be paid earlier. This was the word from Sassa officials.They said the early December payment, which started on 28 November, was a one-off plan to protect beneficiaries, especially the elderly, from thieves and traffic at shopping centres.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsugaTVBT6Ibsn7aySHPop9NhiqXh9eWWsTG0tUPZUz5iQeYdc1dy_tDcM8Sy1dCCKfsNxg9ipLBY4Vj93rBn-xGc7E9G5DiHJ1W6DFl7crPzYmSHNLf1vQBQT0S37ACTrVXpCDKfmHMLQDl80ZEUCUud5tqsNWIwoaVDoT_aVYVLxOhC_SiHlvg7j2J6gAPwPgL0imxv_lrO8TdeUFUwtEmTX3pn9KexPnKnekSNE3bubbd6W0-ySdfgR4J6DkdQXOPP9YDOd5hBTgHBo1NLTvCA_YiCaQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA8vHLY14KOjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
