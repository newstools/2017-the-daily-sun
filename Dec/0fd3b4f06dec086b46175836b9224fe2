Lack of accountability was one of the reasons it wasn’t completed. “Due to the many years of neglect, the budget went up to over R70 million,” he said.Residents held protests over it not being operational after learning services would be housed inside the centre and jobs created.Trollip told Daily Sun: “It took us seven months to complete the abandoned building. “We want people in this municipality to know it is open. We want them to come and access service delivery.”
