He is the alleged middleman who turned State witness in the case of his former boss, Christopher Panayiotou. Panayiotou (31) was convicted in November of organising the killing of his wife Jayde Panayiotou (28) on 21 April 2015.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst5DpUP3zJu5muFD9P1VK7IKbRwvQO5g9ATFYb_CP48bivNv5CEn1vdoStUfM3m9vy0_9RvEUkGe6v-EnIAhJc1mNj-EYWMrVYkvGbnTz0LVaEwVi7zH0g5uAO3LrV1esSMsee6Z_rFzO1WfBfxMuMKnutRIfHa4tpQ76E6C8IkQjFV4uquoUX1fWxONJnBmiSOw5l3cTSj-0nKmdF6f4qCZq_Qjwz-ZUQp33TxvIfIWBMRgUL6lJBNMHmDBD-JrfIBe0yANOvvqt5Mf4N55aVxCQ_TWIA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH_cw1jQWUaqEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He claimed he had been tortured and forced to implicate his boss.He vanished after his immunity as a section 204 witness was cancelled.He was supposed to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court last week to face a murder charge.Siyoni, who was a bouncer at Panayiotou’s nightclub, was the first suspect to be arrested in connection with the murder. At the time he confessed to his involvement.According to the prosecution’s case, Siyoni recruited Sizwezakhe Vumazonke (30), who died in Livingstone Hospital while awaiting trial. Siyoni was allegedly given R80 000 and paid Vumazonke R40 000 for killing Jayde.The Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth found Panayiotou guilty of murder and sentenced him to life for his role in masterminding the murder. Co-accused Sinethemba Nenembe was sentenced to life for murder and an additional 15 years for robbery, and Zolani Sibeko was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and given a 15-year sentence.During his judgment last month, Judge Dayalin Chetty said Siyoni was a liar who changed his version in court.Hawks spokeswoman Captain Anelisa Feni said: “A warrant of arrest has been issued after Siyoni failed to appear in court to face a murder change. The organised crime unit of the Hawks is looking for him.” Anyone with information is asked to call Captain Kanna Swanepoel on 082 319 8712.Meanwhile, Panayiotou’s defence has reportedly filed an application for leave to appeal against his conviction for murder.
