I couldn’t believe that someone could do such an evil thing.”Noluthando said she bought the tombstone for R4 200 at Shweme Zilamkhonto Funerals.Andile Mguqa, an auditor at the funeral parlour, said: “Over the past three years, we’ve lost more than 10 tombstones. Our clients have been reporting the matters to us, thinking we were behind the theft. But the cops have told us that the culprit could be an emerging funeral undertaker.”Police spokesman Andre Beetge said: “A case was opened by the daughter of the dead woman. “The tombstone was taken from the grave to a marble and granite workshop to have the names changed.“The suspect hasn’t been charged yet.”
