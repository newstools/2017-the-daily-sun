In a separate incident, at the Kalfontein farm near Lichtenburg, just 30 minutes outside of Coligny, an 18-year-old woman was arrested for stabbing a 19-year-old woman to death on Saturday after they were drinking at a tavern. Police said the two had initially had an argument.  "The suspect allegedly took out a knife and stabbed the victim [in] the stomach. The victim was certified dead at the scene.
