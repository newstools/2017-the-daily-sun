As he wrestles with the TV, a man appears and disturbs the thug. The thug fires at the man, wounding him in his upper body before he surrenders.Then another robber joins the first thug. They first menace the wounded man before the new robber dislodges the TV, possibly breaking it in the process. The two run with the TV to a getaway car waiting at the gate. The thugs seemed to have their eyes set on nothing but that flat-screen TV.Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said the incident happened on Sunday at about 9pm.“The family heard something at the gate and a man went out to investigate.“The man got to the gate and was overpowered by thugs. “Apart from the man of the house getting shot, another family member hurt a leg when she tried to jump over a wall to get to the neighbour’s house.”He warned people not to go out when they heard suspicious sounds outside their home.“They should phone either their neighbours or the police. They should not go out because they could end up being victims.”He said no one has been arrested and the police are looking for the suspects.
