    ORLANDO Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry about the way his team is missing chances in front of goal. Bucs had AmaZulu by the throat on Saturday but squandered numerous goal-scoring opportunities, many of them one-on-one situations, in their 1-1 draw. The Serbian coach says he is only human and coaches “lions that give everything on the pitch”. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJsLearADXuJGaWfGaAdbzYNsoS87oYDhyhxJ1CjNS189K-sBr1lZhs8HRMaffbyngfl6VTd2Se8Li5diJ0pdTW4Qn-Z2ATzhYAVEZwCpyQ8C8DU7KDYnvr_hA3HAFkw-dFg7Y-bpxMVKOcyQ4jTpvLuA1QeEPwlzo-xJQScCt1_SLodarOG1jJSiJPZzm0j2n8ocdLdM24tzBYLByeOeFDIoqf6meDisQkTKM7BTUonL2LLhn0kkjiNdKiUhX8v-zC00lCMg7uyImimrNjdmXGQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzABn1bJyplUREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

My players respect the badge – I can tell from their body language and from the effort they put in at training. “What we didn’t do well in this game is get the ball into the net.” Sredojevic said Bucs were still a work in progress, but in his mind he had one million reasons to believe that he was coaching an extraordinary team. He described South Africa as a welcoming country offering so much hospitality but compared Pirates’ performance to a visitor who is given his favourite cup of tea – but gets no sugar. Added Sredojevic: “I regret getting only a point but not the performance. “The point is like a cup of tea without sugar. “It would have been different if there was sugar.” The Serbian mentor had comforting words for misfiring striker Thamsanqa Gabuza and said he had yet to decide if he would go in search of a proven scorer in the transfer market in January. Added Sredojevic: “Our type of football deserves to yield results. But we as the technical team won’t give up. “We will assess the team after the Christmas recess and make a decision at that time.”
