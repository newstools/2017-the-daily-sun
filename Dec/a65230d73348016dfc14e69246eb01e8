When they are in the building, they then go to the bathrooms and steal the sanitising liquid bottles. One hospital official said: “We used to wonder why the sanitiser went missing every second day. “Sometimes the liquid would disappear the same day it had been placed in the bathrooms.“What raised eyebrows was the disappearance of the containers. When we investigated, we got word that the sanitising liquid was stolen by addicts who drink it to get high.“We don’t know what they mix it with, but they are going to die.”Now the sanitisers are guarded and people are no longer allowed to use it themselves.The container states the liquid is 70% alcohol and the guards believe that is why it is such a hit.Modiegi Majuba (38), a patient, said: “These kids are going to die. They use anything they come across to get high.“Next time they are going to drink something that will kill them.”
