Police spokeswoman Constable Tshifiwa Radzilane said cops uprooted 1 159 dagga plants weighing 70kg and with an estimated street value of R250 000. She praised the residents for informing the cops. “We hope other villagers will learn from the people of Elim and call the cops when they see something wrong in their area,” Radzilane told the People’s Paper. She warned criminals that police in the area are out in numbers to make sure crooks don’t have a place to hide.
