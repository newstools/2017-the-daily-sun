    A scheduled feedback session for Uber drivers fearing for
their safety took a wrong turn on Tuesday when the company called security,
resulting in a standoff outside the Uber offices near the Cape Town
International Airport.Driver Zuko Tyaleashe said the group of less than 20
contractors "came in peace", wanting to discuss their safety concerns
with the company after the murder of an Uber driver in Belhar just over a week
ago.The 29-year-old man â€“ who did Uber trips as well as private
trips - was shot dead in Violin Crescent, Belhar.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvIiqhNjCTonGX-HsfXcOouWH-LUoWDHNnm5QnNoqiFuYTiMmgu6GwSkb2Xm2FoEDYwIuVfC7wGSGyI-Qi5PmtRQAp9jqKAk9uZgCzOS8yXJxDluOpN531YDXTlJxZJsRbAnAFZNFt6BrRNwuVPyAdi_PWSyK6fRF6_FrVyJ1vw4QC3YUZY4TY_34vrKj_CDdyOROScbxtgVI14ynh9CzxICGMT20GQFbIdaBrPb-xbzD4tihMwJPRYaGDmmEf1V7AcDhhNTUdbNGrVCPqwyQTU4wGsNeQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA-CUsNoiTRiEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When we did and asked
to talk to them, they refused to come and speak to us. Instead they phoned
security who surrounded us with guns. They even phoned the police when we did
nothing illegal. We didn't even sing!" said Tyaleashe."We told security to shoot, because they were pointing
the guns at us. We only came to talk, in peace."Uber spokesperson Samantha Allenberg said a small group had
arrived at their Cape Town Greenlight Hub on Tuesday after the company, last
week, "updated all driver-partners about this tragic passing and let them
know that it was not during an Uber trip".She blamed misinformation on incorrect media articles.When asked if Uber had refused to engage with drivers and
had sent security out instead, Allenberg said the company is "always
willing to engage with drivers on an independent basis through the approved
support channels"."We respect driver-partners as valuable partners with a
voice and a choice and we want driver-partners to feel they can talk to us
about anything at any time."We have established channels of communication to raise
these type of concerns. Our partner support team operates 24/7. We are always
talking with partners and taking their feedback on board. We regularly host
focus groups and we intend to increase the frequency of these."NEWS24
