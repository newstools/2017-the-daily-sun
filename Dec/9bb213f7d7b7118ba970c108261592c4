If they are not there, we must demand them from the owner of the taxi or bus,” explained Chikunga.She said: “Mechanisms to slow down traffic are being placed at hazardous roads. “Foot bridges are being built across many busy roads and railway tracks. “Government is negotiating with rail licence holders to improve rail crossing safety, including the provision of level crossings. “Hazardous roads are also being re-engineered to remove the danger.”Chikunga said most fatal crashes in 2016/17 happened on a Saturday while during the 2015/16 festive season, more crashes were recorded on Fridays and Mondays.
