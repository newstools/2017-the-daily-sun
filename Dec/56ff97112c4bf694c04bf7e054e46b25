When people come here to report crime, they must be given attention. “Do not do your manicure while on duty or be busy on the cellphone and ignore people. “Do not ask insensitive questions when women come here to report rape cases. “The rape victims should feel safe and not feel like they are being interrogated in court.” He said he was happy to be back at the hostel to fulfil his promise, with the assistance of cops, to eliminate crime at the hostel.“All the criminals shooting and killing people here should be dealt with accordingly. “They should know their place. Our tactical response unit will deal with them. No criminal will be a role model for our youth.”Mbalula first visited the hostel in September and promised residents to build a satellite police station.About 100 people have been killed at the hostel since 2014.Residents had requested a satellite station because they believed the presence of the police would make a difference. Resident Bongiwe Xulu (43) told Daily Sun that her four-year stay at the hostel has been worse than hell. “Hopefully, crime will decrease now that we have a satellite station,” she said.Another resident, Thulani Dlamini (33), said he was pleased that a satellite has been opened. “I hope peace will be restored and we’ll be abe to get help whenever we need it,” he said. “Let us just hope cops will do their work and not hide inside the station.” He said they were willing to work with the police.
