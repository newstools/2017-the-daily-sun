to get behind World AIDS Day 2017 and to put the prevention of HIV back on the
agenda.Mzansi is urged to join the rest of the
Word in observing world aids day.World AIDS day is observed on December 1
and the 2017 theme is  “It is my right to
know my status. Prevention is my responsibility”. The theme encourages South Africans to make
their actions count and to take personal and collective responsibility to
prevent new HIV and TB infections.  SANAC
said it wants to encourage conversations among South Africans to respond to
critical questions such as: What is your Responsibility? What can you do to
prevent the spread of HIV and TB infections?Every Friday, since November 10,  all South Africans were encouraged to wear a
red ribbon, take a picture and share it on social media using the hashtag
#RedRibbonFriday, organize HIV testing services in their workplace and raise
awareness about the prevention of HIV and TB."The red ribbon has become a symbol of
solidarity and commitment to the fight against HIV and AIDS. It is a symbol
worn to recognise and honour individuals, loved ones, family members, friends
and colleagues who are living positively with HIV, and honour the memory of
those who had passed on due to AIDS–related conditions. HIV is not over. "It’s time to get everyone to play
their role in preventing HIV and TB. Through #RedRibbonFriday we can encourage
millions of South Africans to be conscious about the need to prevent the spread
of HIV and TB," said SANAC.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will, in
his capacity as Chairperson SANAC, address the World Aids Day national
commemoration event at the Walter Sisulu University Stadium, Mthatha, Eastern
Cape on Friday.In a recorded message, Deputy President
Ramaphosa said: “This is a time to remember those that we have lost to the twin
epidemics of AIDS and Tuberculosis. It is also a time to reflect on the
extraordinary progress that we’ve made as a nation in the fight against AIDS
and TB. It is also a time when we recommit ourselves to the achievement of an
AIDS-free generation”.
