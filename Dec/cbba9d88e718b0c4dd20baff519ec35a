People are doing bad things,” she said.“The law must be harsh with these people or the hard work by police will not mean a thing. The courts must not grant these people bail because they are a problem.” Resident Nozuko Jali (35) said it’s shocking how cruel people have become.“People are so heartless,” said Nozuko. How can they bury a child like this?”Another resident said Delft is one of the most dangerous areas in Cape Town because of problems with drugs and criminals who are terrorising the community.“I am sure that this is criminal activity. We are not safe at all,” said the resident.The incident happened just two days after the City of Cape Town rolled out a wide range of integrated services, from policing to social workers, with the launch of the first neighbourhood safety team.Captain Fredrick van Wyk said that the body was identified as that of a missing Delft South teenager. He sustained a wound to the right side of his head and had a swollen face.“The motive is unknown. No one has been arrested,” said Van Wyk.Anyone with information about this fatal incident should phone Delft police on 021 954 9000 or CrimeStop on 0860 010111.
