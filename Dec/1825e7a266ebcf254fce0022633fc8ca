Some of those people hire thugs to steal our animals.”He said owners of butcheries and shisa nyamas fuel the problem by buying meat from stock thieves.“The police should intensify their patrols at this time of the year,” he said. Melikhaya said one his cows was stolen by criminals from the bush in Motherwell, NU 12.“It’s dangerous for us because we graze our cattle in places far away from many people. Most of the robbers are known to the community but people are afraid to report them to the police.”Chamaz Kupe (46) of Booysens Park said the government should issue herdsmen with guns to defend themselves against livestock thieves. “These thugs are brutal. They steal our livestock which we depend on to survive.“The government should allow us to use guns to fight these robbers. “It’s very expensive to feed and look after livestock.”He said three of his cattle and two goats were stolen this year.Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: “The police are appealing to all stock owners to exercise caution and be on high alert at this time. “Stock thieves are on the lookout for unattended stock to steal and sell for a quick buck.” He also warned members of the public to stop buying stolen meat and stock.He said if caught they’ll be asked to provide proof of purchase for the meat or livestock. “If there’s no proof then the police will have no option but to arrest the seller and the buyer of the stolen stock.”
