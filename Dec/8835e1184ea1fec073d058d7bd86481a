another manner.Myburgh, a News24 investigative journalist, wrote the book
The Republic of Gupta and has probed, and written about, several alleged
corrupt relationships involving government officials.He was part of the team from News24, AmaBhungane and Daily
Maverick who were last month crowned overall winners of the Vodacom Journalist
of the Year awards for their work on the #GuptaLeaks, which exposed the extent
of the influence that the controversial Gupta family has over South African
public enterprises.Pauw is the author of the book The President's Keepers.They have both, according to their legal representatives,
been requested to make statements at the Durban North police station in a
matter apparently relating to material they have written about.A police officer, based in Durban North, indicated to their
attorneys that he was the investigating officer in the matter.'Sensitive matter'However, national police spokesperson Vishnu Naidoo on
Tuesday said no case had been opened, and that Pauw and Myburgh were not under
investigation.News24 then provided him with the surname and cellphone
number of the apparent investigating officer.It is also understood the matter may not have been
registered as a case to be investigated, but as an inquiry.Asked if this was the case, Naidoo said on Wednesday:
"Due to the sensitive nature of such matters we are unable to discuss them
in the public domain."News24 called the cellphone of the apparent investigating
officer on Tuesday.A man who answered said he would pass a message on to the
officer. The officer did not return calls, nor respond to an SMS on Wednesday.Previous attempt for arrest warrantPauw on Tuesday said he was told about potential charges he
could face about two weeks ago, when he heard that a police officer had tried
to secure a warrant in Pietermaritzburg for his arrest.The officer had not managed to do so.Last month, Pauw had said the warrant related to five
charges, including fraud and crimen injuria. He had not been sure whether police would try again with
another magistrate.He said on Tuesday that the investigating officer in the
case would not divulge what was being probed."Whatever he brings, we will defend it," Pauw
said.On Tuesday, the lawyers representing both Pauw and Myburgh -
Willem de Klerk Attorneys - sent a letter to a colonel, the investigating
officer, who they said on Monday had spoken to Willem de Klerk about the
matter.The letter is headed: "Criminal investigation: Jacques
Pauw and Pieter-Louis Myburgh."'Potential suspects for what they have written'"From the said telephone discussions it appears that Mr
Pauw is regarded as a potential suspect related to material contained in his
book The President’s Keepers," the letter said."It further appears that Mr Pieter-Louis Myburgh is a
potential suspect based on an article or articles he may have authored which
appeared in the news media."It said the investigating officer had not been willing to
disclose further details about what was being investigated.Requested to provide information to policeThe letter confirmed a request by the investigating officer
that Pauw and Myburgh go to the Durban North police station to answer
questions, or to possibly make statements or do both."Our clients are not at this stage willing to answer
questions or make statements but would prefer for the investigation to be
completed first," the letter stated."If you require our clients to depose to affidavits
stating as much, we are happy to oblige and will send such affidavits to you as
soon as possible."Pauw and Myburgh’s decision not to make statements yet was
based on legal advice and their Constitutional rights."It does not imply that they are uncooperative in the
matter," the letter stated.Full cooperationPauw and Myburgh, it said, would give their full cooperation
if the National Prosecuting Authority decided to act against them."Our clients are desirous to finalise the matters under
investigation in the spirit of co-operation," the letter read."If they are required to appear in any criminal court
they will fully co-operate without the need for arrest." News24 editor Adriaan Basson said the police investigation
amounted to attempted intimidation.'Clear attempt at intimidation'"It is outrageous that the cops are going after
journalists when corrupt politicians and captured business people roam
free," he said."We will oppose any attempts to bring criminal charges
against Myburgh. This is a clear attempt to try and intimidate us from doing
our jobs. We won’t be deterred."The Hawks were also investigating material in Pauw’s book.They previously said they were investigating the leak of
classified information that ended up being published in it.This was after a case was opened by the State Security
Agency (SSA).The SSA had also demanded that the book be withdrawn.Previously the South African Revenue Service (SARS) said it
was considering legal action in relation to Pauw’s book.This, after the Sunday Times carried an extract of his book
which alleged that Zuma received monthly payments of R1m from controversial
tender mogul Roy Moodley, without declaring it to SARS.NEWS24
