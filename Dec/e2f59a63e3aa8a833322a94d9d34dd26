The curtain of the bedroom window was covered with blazing flames.“I ran to rescue my son and shouted for him, but he did not respond. The flames and the thick cloud of smoke were too strong, but I threw myself inside, ready to die with my son. I woke up to find myself surrounded by residents.”Neighbour Bongani Sithole (35) said Josephina fainted after she inhaled smoke. “We searched for her son inside, but he was nowhere to be found. A neighbour arrived with him after spotting him crying in the street with severely burnt fingers.”Josephina’s unemployed husband, Michael Sibanda, said the fire ate up their Christmas clothes, groceries, furniture and blankets.“We are thankful to neighbours and the fire rescue team who put out the fire.”Ward councillor Madala Mgwena said: “We are currently interacting with donors as well as Sassa and Disaster Management to help the family with food and clothing.”
