She shook him off but Kutlwano fell and the man grabbed him. As the mum is deaf and mute, she was unable to scream for help. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: “The body was found in a decomposed state in the bushes by a passerby, who alerted the police. “Due to the state the body was found in, it was difficult to determine how the baby died. A post mortem will be conducted. “The police are investigating a case of murder. The suspect is still on the run. We plead with anyone who may know his whereabouts to call Captain Louis Ferreira on 083 419 7361.” Free State acting police commissioner Major-General Tollie Afonso condemned the incident. “The community needs to stand up against the abuse and senseless killing of our innocent children,” he said. “We are working around the clock to find the man who snatched baby Kutlwano from his mum, which led to his senseless death.”
