It’s unfortunate for Allister, but it’s time for him to move on,” Kempson said.“I think they should go for someone from outside, (New Zealanders) Robbie Deans and John Mitchell are two that come to mind. “Why wouldn’t they go for people who have proven expertise of putting teams into positions where they can win Test matches?“But I don’t think it will happen in my lifetime. The South African way of thinking is that they wouldn’t look outside their square box.”Several reports have indicated that SA Rugby is eager to replace Coetzee, but the coach is seemingly unwilling to step down.A newspaper report last weekend indicated that Coetzee sought legal advice regarding the merits of his dismissal.Rapport reported that SA Rugby has a verbal agreement with Coetzee over a 65% win mandate, but the coach and his lawyers are confident it cannot be used as a reason for dismissal.The review process of Coetzee’s performance, which was supposed to take place last Wednesday, never took place, the Afrikaans newspaper further reported.It has been delayed until 16 January next year.SA Rugby has said it will only comment on the matter in the new year, according to a press statement released last Friday. – SPORT24
