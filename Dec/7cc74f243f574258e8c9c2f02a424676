    A FURIOUS Cape Town City FC chairman John Comitis and his head coach Benni McCarthy are considering relocating the Citizens to Durban and renaming the team Durban City FC.He wants to follow in the footsteps of Chippa United, who took up a good money-spinning offer from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and moved to Port Elizabeth, where they have use of the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium for free.Their anger at the Mother City comes from being kicked out of the Cape Town Stadium which has since been declared unavailable next week due to preparations for the Rugby Sevens event scheduled for 9 and 10 December.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoIFKyyB1agCg7BG1sq1MVjwS2mlBOcYWAGQaJgQ5mI8Km4ORqDnYkpV-pTUjszCZNq1jYCtORBsJs4AxCTMq2P8l8PYv3zUZw6OomkRC2GCo77JMVyovLgMW5qSR10Gcl-gQNPGsXlBJj8orTA2H5dse4_lEaGuJOwW2h3MNP0MNdte0RktJ5Ltfa3mnFy6IMr9CEG1I_E6rnvgjUSjgY6i6cYnIM7jYQhBMCfYdD7hXGXC-2wmihCyAF6RIQ7MUZsTFWT-_GaH6loRWt\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFNbWLNaq7ZcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Chippa United moved from Cape Town to PE and East London – and now I understand why, as they get the backing of the city councils. “It’s costing me R250 000 to fly my team to Durban. I had no option but to play in KZN, or it would have cost me another R500 000 to fly Maritzburg to another venue. We have been forced into exile.”Comitis said he was willing to spend R200 million of his own money to build a new stadium, but added: “I need land and the council to help me.”McCarthy, in an open letter yesterday, blew his top over the fact his title-chasing side have to play Maritzburg in Durban.McCarthy described it as a dark day for football.The coach hit out: “From a footballing perspective, a win will take this City team to the top of the log table in the nation’s most prestigious competition.And to play that crucial game in the opposition’s province (where KZN was easily able and willing to accommodate us) is quite frankly hurtful and embarrassing. “It blows my mind that a stadium which only exists because of the Soccer World Cup cannot be reserved for the city’s premium soccer team for 15 out of 365 days.“Football has been sold lies in Cape Town. When there is a private wedding, the stadiums are ready. When there’s a rugby competition, the stadiums are ready. When there’s a nitro circus car event, the stadiums are ready. “For football, Cape Town’s World Cup stadium – unavailable. Athlone Stadium – used by a thousand tenants and it has become a sand patch. New­lands – unavailable. Making an emergency plan at another venue anywhere in the entire Western Cape – sorry, we didn’t think that far ahead. But our fixtures are no secret. It’s about planning and willingness – and I cannot believe our officials cannot see the immense commercial, cultural, and community impact Cape Town City FC have in this city.”Added Comitis: “We take two steps forward and five steps back. There is a ray of light in the form of the deputy mayor, Ian Neilson. But there are so much red tape and obstacles in our way.”
