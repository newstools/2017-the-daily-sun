    ZIMBABWE’S parliament has been urged to offer
psychological counselling to stressed MPs and ministers who lost posts in the
political upheaval that saw Robert Mugabe finally ousted.Ex-ministers are among MPs who are suffering from high
blood pressure and stress over the loss of their cabinet posts, parliament
heard last week, according to New Zimbabwe.com.“We have had challenges as parliament… whereby we have
had people who have been moved from positions and all that and people have gone
through a lot of challenges, pressure, stress and blood pressure,” said
opposition MDC, Prosper Mutseyami.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvMudgLPcm6wezmKwqWSXbD821K6QMSugr04hBBWw8GKNUKHiN43gBIJ78tuFTc79r1Emip7HTn_D_O6HPPY2VCOULojf9PnlSfO-YurP9FSCoz9wCP6ZrfDLDb-txq5MBSW1H2CHqYNaT4hNqRfSVzeBFL8KaYd2ihNaSWm9rko-b3Q9M5JTMf56z8rmUkEdILl_0WI4ibV2DahPFcmsYIpemvMmByAO6JlFx9jhuDM-dTFEPxIdDmBApbTpnPQcWGnuPXt7riNsHU5KQwireS_uAPk1NsJD62mQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBn8MxWYb3-iEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

why they are in new positions and they do not understand that they are now
backbenchers,” he added.According to the official parliamentary record, Mutseyami
said the parliament’s clinic needed to offer counselling “to deal with these
challenges or these kinds of trauma”.Speaker of parliament, Jacob Mudenda, agreed saying his
cousin had lost a ministerial post “and he became so stressed up that in the
end, he could not recover.”Many ministers perceived to be linked to former first
lady Grace Mugabe were sacked in the wake of last month’s military operation
that removed Mugabe from power and replaced him with Emmerson Mnangagwa. http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/ousted-zim-ministers-suffering-from-trauma-need-help-report-20171225
