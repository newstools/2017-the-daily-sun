    ACCORDING to African tradition, sangomas’ bones are not to be touched by anyone else! That’s why sangoma Marangrang Legodi felt disrespected when cops allegedly touched his bones and scattered them all over his yard. It happened when the 40-year-old sangoma from Newlands Village in Ga-Mashashane, outside Polokwane, Limpopo was arrested on Monday for possession of dagga.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssyGMiK-fE5B62brCphq-NRQcmj-Znx5pcT2pIy4vKXz93GygdMppLqacXmhBeSxcsbqSLqavhV3q0cIrP0dbLzEvp7mjxM2DdUyljfIkJFsHn_sWbnbhvJzDyflQMrmNwGCTn9_mX-0IdzKIQFMuoUSlPCB4ciIYV5YiYqaI_tDyHWAbDJfeYgz68QwnoG-tWuKKFQ4ro4Wp_AHaz3vnGGQ5EkkCicAU821DNCJISswbRKcxYdl7h84z-9x6Qyj-gmp9XkLTY3Y51enPAcT1IKL-9_eWY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC4OfcXXrPw-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They undermined the Legodi ancestors and now my ancestors are not happy.“We will just have to wait and see what the ancestors will do to them because they won’t leave this,” he said.Marangrang claims he was assaulted by the cops. He said: “One of the cops hit me with a gun while others gave me hot klaps. The back of my head and my feet are sore.”He thinks the cops assaulted him because he was once a ward councillor.“One of the cops said I used to give them a hard time during my term. “They must pay for disrespecting my ancestors.” Marangrang said he didn’t grow or sell dagga. “As sangomas, we use it to heal people.”He was fined R100 for possession of dagga and will appear in court on 12 January. Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Marangrang should open a case against the cops. “Police brutality is totally condemned and community members must expose it,” said Ngoepe.
