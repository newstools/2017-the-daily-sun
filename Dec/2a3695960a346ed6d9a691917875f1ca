The church decided to demolish the house and build the family a bigger home. Archbishop Titus Monareng said it was their duty to help the needy.“This is something that will make God happy,” said the bishop.He said they could see Richard wasn’t happy and when they visited his house, what they saw made them sad.“We had to do something to help. We agreed to use our monthly contributions and I used my family’s money.”Monareng said when you share the little you have with those who need your help, God will bless you.The happy gogo said she was grateful for being the chosen one.“Out of so many people, my family was the lucky one. “These people were sent by God. My prayers have finally been answered. We will now live like normal people,” she said.Richard said: “I have been trying to find a job so that we can live a better life but I haven’t succeeded. Now I have new hope for the future.”
