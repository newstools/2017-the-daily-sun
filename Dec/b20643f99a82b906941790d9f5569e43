    MZANSI has the 6th most shopping centres in the world, yet
more and more malls are being built, according to the SA Council of Shopping
Centres (SACSC).In terms of square metres, SA ranks as sub-Saharan Africa’s
most saturated retail market, representing 88% of the available space in the
region.Malls in South Africa are getting bigger, according to a
recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Real Estate

developed have steadily increased in size since the 1990’s with centres slated
for completion between 2017 and 2020 being significantly larger than those developed
during the 1990’s and 2000’s.This trend towards larger centres may be explained by
developers opting for larger formats in order to dominate its immediate
catchment area and attract a higher proportion of national tenants, thus
strengthening the centre’s position within its catchment area.The data also indicates that proposed centres planned in
SA’s city regions, local or niche towns and service towns are all now 100%
larger compared to those developed during the 2000s.As of July 2017, the SA retail development pipeline measures
1.9 million square metres across 68 centres - the bulk of which is planned for
completion in 2018. Currently, there are 17 shopping centres slated for
completion in the remaining weeks of 2017.Unique perspectivePhil Barttram, executive director of MSCI, said that there
is a unique perspective of the link between retail space, economic activity and
population density.“MSCI’s latest research, based on SACSC’s shopping centre
directory, provides a unique perspective of the linkage between expected retail
mall space, economic activity and population densities. Given a highly
competitive environment for malls in specific nodes, we believe that centre
selection within the retail segments will become increasingly important,"
explained Barttram."There are fundamental drivers of mall defensiveness
and it will be the malls that best exploit these factors that will prove to be
more resilient in the times ahead.”Retail supply in the small-town markets are still expecting
double-digit growth for 2017 to 2020 compared to 2010 to 2016. The Mpumalanga,
Limpopo and Eastern Cape provinces combined contribute 82% of the overall
retail pipeline in the small settlement-type markets.The study conducted by MSCI also notes that, despite the
slowing of retail development, the SA retail market has expanded significantly
over the past few decades, increasing to 23.4 million square metres at the end
of 2016. Since 2010, retail stock has grown by an average of 17.3% with 32 new
centres per year. Last year, Menlyn Park in Pretoria, now the largest shopping
centre in SA, embarked on a R2bn redevelopment that added 50 000 square metres
of additional retail space to its already massive footprint, making it one of
the largest malls in Africa.In February this year, the Fourways Mall expansion project
in Johannesburg broke ground. This project, costing R23.7m, will see the mall
become a retail behemoth of 175 000 square metres.The Pavilion as well as Ballito Junction, both in
KwaZulu-Natal have also undergone expansion projects.Another possible reason for the increase in mall size,
including redevelopment of malls, may be globalisation. Globalisation has
brought many international brands into the country that were once considered
unattainable. This means that the store-within-a-store that stock these
international brands will be rendered obsolete, thus creating the opportunity
for expanded retail space, according to the report.
