Cops arrived and rushed him to hospital. The father of the dead man, who only gave his name as Mbotho, told the People’s Paper: “I know my son terrorised many people.”On Monday morning, residents on their way home from a tavern found a body with stab wounds in Ralarala Street in Lwandle.Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the two deaths to the SunTeam. He said cops are investigating both murders. Anyone with information can phone Lwandle police on 021 845 2060 or 08600 10111.
