    FIVE years ago 14 Eastern Cape school principals were told to improve their schools’ low matric results or be demoted. The five years they were given to change their schools’ performance are now up. Each principal who fails to reach the target will be demoted from principal to vice-principal.The South African Democratic Teachers Union is not happy about it. The union’s Eastern Cape secretary, Chris Mdingi, said the education department’s decision is one-sided. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=915692892&t=artid%3d920a466b-8d86-4ec6-935e-71833925c4ed%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/Landing&sz=300x250&c=915692892&t=artid%3d920a466b-8d86-4ec6-935e-71833925c4ed%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>“This decision does not suit us at all. Did they go and check the challenges at these schools? “Our province is very rural so it faces many challenges. There are schools that still have no furniture. Some schools are situated in villages where there are serial killers, rapists and boys who are fighting each other, especially in the Butterworth district.“All these things are issues that can affect the performance of a school. “Why is the decision only targeting school principals? There are officials like education development officers and district directors who are supposed to know everything about certain schools that underperform.“We do not support the underperformance of schools but we say before any action is taken, a proper investigation must be undertaken.” Education MEC Mandla Makupula said in 952 high schools, 14 principals have not produced good results for the past five years.“HoD Themba Kojana and I took the decision last year that now we have to act. We have been talking and talking but now it is time to take action. “We said those principals that are performing need to be rewarded for their good performance. That is why we have national teacher awards. “Those principals that come with average results were encouraged to improve to join those who are performing well. “Then we went to the last category. We told them that we have been assisting them to improve results but they keep producing bad results.” Makupula said these principals and departmental officials reached an agreement that if the principals failed to improve results they would be demoted. The principals have received letters already regarding the matter. Makupula did not release the names of the schools.
