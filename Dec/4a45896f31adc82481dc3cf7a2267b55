On Monday, the gogos and people living with disabilities were visited by the Red Ants, who tried to evict them.But the gogos refused to move out of the flats.They stood together and chanted as the big trucks approached.They waved their walking sticks and dared the men in red to approach them.Ultimately, the Red Ants had no choice but to leave, promising to come back.Gogo Mmakitso Manamela (60) said they are going nowhere.“Before any eviction, these people must start with those who are buying houses. We are not fighting, we only want our houses.“As those trucks came in, we were willing to die for what we believe in. We can’t be treated like this,” she said.Ekurhuleni Human Settlements MEC Lesiba Mpya said they were aware of the situation.“I went there with other officials to assess the situation. We found a group of gogos and people living with disabilities,” said Mpya.“We condemn the illegal occupation of RDPs and land. “People must understand there’s a process to be followed in the allocation of houses.”Red Ants spokesman Johan Bosch said: “Our men left after moving some occupants who were apparently there illegally. “We had to postpone the matter to another day in order to avoid violence.”
