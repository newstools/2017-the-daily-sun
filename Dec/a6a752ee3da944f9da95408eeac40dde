They will keep us warm in winter.” Madihlaba Mphele said as communities, they should use such moments to celebrate the lives of gogos and madalas. “We are grateful to the municipality for putting our elderly first.“This clearly shows that the municipality does care about the gogos and madalas in the villages,” Mphele said.
