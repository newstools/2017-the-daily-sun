Scheepers said real change began at home. “Fathers must learn to be take charge and ensure their children grow up under good leadership.“That is the only way they will understand the importance of protecting others,” he said.Former gangster Ronald Nkuna urged young people to stop doing things that put them in trouble with the law.He said he was diagnosed with HIV after being arrested in 2007.Ronald said: “I was part of a gang in our area and when I got arrested I never thought I would be abused. “I was raped all night by other inmates. “It was so painful. “Then I discovered I was HIV-positive when I went for a test. “Crime doesn’t pay.”
