    AT the age of 58 and unable to work any more, madala Simon Sethole should be retired and comfortable in the knowledge that a government grant will keep him clothed and fed.But the madala from Bochum, outside Polokwane is a worried man, fearing he will be forgotten.This was after he was told when he went to apply for a new ID that he wasn’t South African, but Zimbabwean.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=945728153&t=artid%3d3f17206a-278a-4402-a750-e90020536efa%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=945728153&t=artid%3d3f17206a-278a-4402-a750-e90020536efa%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>The horrified madala told Daily Sun he was born in Mzansi and not in Zimbabwe.Madala Sethole said he lost his first ID several years ago. He immediately went back to Home Affairs to apply for another ID and was happy when he received a new one.Then, following a doctor’s visit for a leg problem recently, he was told to apply for a grant as he couldn’t work any more.When the madala went to apply he was told his current ID was torn and couldn’t be scanned.“I went back to Home Affairs to apply for a new ID but to my shock they told me they couldn’t help because I was not South African,” said Sethole.He said a Zimbabwean had used his lost ID to cross the Zimbabwe border.“I’m getting old and now I fear for my life. I can’t work any more and this means a struggle for my family.” Sethole said Home Affairs officials told him to bring his parents along.“I brought my 89-year-old mother along but still got no assistance.“My mum is too old now and cannot manage to make all these trips up and down. I fear that if my mother dies, then it’s finished for me.” He said they were asked to do DNA tests but he still doesn’t have an ID. “I’m not Zimbabwean. I was born in Mzansi,” said Sethole.Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the matter had been recorded and they would communicate with the provincial department.“We’ll investigate and contact him.”
