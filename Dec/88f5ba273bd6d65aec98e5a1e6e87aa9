It looked bad but we managed to survive. We finished in the top eight the following season.”Ertugral took Ajax to three cup finals including winning the Absa Cup in 2007.However, the former Orlando Pirates mentor is concerned about the fact Ajax had scored only 10 goals in 14 matches and conceded 16.Said Ertugral: “I will be looking at fixing our defensive structure and our finishing. But I have never been a fan of the January transfer window. It’s rare you find top players available at this time. “I believe we have plenty of top class young talent at Ajax. If we can get maybe one or two more players to strengthen the squad that will be fine but I’m not going to buy just for the sake of it.”He said that while the likes of Mamelodi Sundowns, Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs are the locomotives that drive SA soccer, clubs like Ajax were important to Mzansi soccer.Explained Ertugral: “Over the years Ajax have produced a lot of top class players for this country. “There is a wealth of talent in Cape Town and Ajax has been at the fore-front of harnessing that talent. “I’m confident we have enough good players at the club without having to go into the transfer market.”
