    MAMELODI Sundowns star Percy Tau is top class! Tau has emerged as an early contender for Premier Soccer League Player of the Season. Bloemfontein Celtic assistant coach Lehlohonolo Seema had nothing but praise for the Bafana Bafana international who was partly responsible for the dismantling of his team at the weekend. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss6z8Z1Z9YpVq-OjKoCkgj7eick1066BeePFdSZdnj6B8xo2QuqFHaS1BHbq_Gkn2iMtO-vHLOD0FlWpLpNzsv_qZ96C5ZW1yQbqh6q0aK2ytH52tukaKN6lYoXsRuUcZ5tH0b6j1n5IN4CfEc08p6pcYyQLjXzWjlCVp4074AENfnmSp8rri-UGBWYilBBRpkcuheVzTnB6DWMMvB8VmYGwp2tl1nu6ipxllL3FGeaZuzK-aPrPR0ecmMinIcpZ2n0M5EwNbndfyrLQNKvTD8AtQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC1ia0_YM54PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Sema did not hesitate to call Tau the best footballer in the league. Celtic were hammered 4-1 by the runaway log leaders at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. Man of the Match Tau scored and made two assists for Thokozani Sekotlong and Tiyani Mabunda. Themba Zwane netted the fourth to complete the hiding. Siwelele tried their utmost to contain Tau but the player was unstoppable. Seema said: “Tau is top class. If you think you can mark him for 90 minutes, you are mistaken. Before you know it he is gone. We warned our guys about him. “He is on top of his game. He is on another level.” Celtic hope to pick up the pieces when they host SuperSport United at Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm). Said Seema: “We hope to end the year on a high note and give our supporters a good Christmas gift. We just have to dust ourselves off and have another go against another team from Pretoria. “We can’t fault our boys, we made a good start. We have to go back to the drawing board and rectify our mistakes.” Jelusic returns to Bloemfontein tomorrow and will be on the bench when Siwelele host Matsatsantsa a Pitori. The Free State outfit battled relegation last season, but there has been a huge improvement this season. Still, Seema urged his players not to relax. Celtic are seventh in the league table with 19 points from 13 games. Added Seema: “If we finish in the top eight, it will be an incredible season for us. The players are responding well to the coach’s methods.”
