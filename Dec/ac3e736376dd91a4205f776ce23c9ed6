Two unlicensed firearms and dagga were also found during the operations. KZN’s acting provincial commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, commended the cops for the operation. “We appeal to livestock owners to take extra precautions during the festive season. They should brand their livestock so it is easier to identify them if they are found by the police.”
