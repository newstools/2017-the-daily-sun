    KAIZER Chiefs have been relying too much on Itumeleng Khune’s saves, which has helped them concede fewer goals and ultimately win or draw matches they could have lost. Khune’s heroics between the sticks has saved Chiefs on numerous occasions, with the 30-year-old goal-minder producing award-winning performances.  And his heroics haven’t gone unnoticed. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstaF5XM9QCQxetsx568vrh9jfNl5lTNIO7lnouGbUWSlFNPZ3kd-uqqAUolkS_bmlzzpJVWs23NdvBymkUxJFiDYkReAe09iqUAHDA-uoHj0sswwN7yKI2xlpm9z99UAUR_TFmkBxv0E7nJLaPOb5Ud7kwwHxOrTCbND8gLObiMUICzkqZz4Eq1XffaMSDQYLhFuhD31A2Klurr1sRNvvH8LPVeKQfoNj8_t4XkjB_eYVyAAXWzJLNfIDn1qMkrmN1Gugnv-t4J8Ts5CjOG\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIEHL0HT8H9BEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We want to collect maximum points in our last three games to give our fans a great Christmas present. Personally I haven’t been in great form. I have not been scoring. “Our goalkeeper has been brilliant but we have to start scoring goals to give him a breather in goal.” Parker added that the Chilli Boys would come at them guns blazing, saying he expects a tough game from the Eastern Cape outfit. “They and their coach were not happy after they lost the cup match to us. We expect a tough game. “It won’t be a surprise if they come at us strongly from the outset, as they are gunning for revenge.” Cardoso jumped in: “Chippa are a great side. It’s going to be a difficult game for us. But we want to get a win and give our fans something to cheer about. “Chippa will be eyeing revenge after the cup loss but we will be up for it.”
