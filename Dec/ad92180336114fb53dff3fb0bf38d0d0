Daily Sun recently found patients sleeping on the floor, benches and chairs in the casualty area of the hospital.With the festive season upon us, Ramokgopa said the province’s hospitals were ready for a busy time.“Other than accidents, our main concerns are alcohol-related injuries, abuse and children injured by fireworks.”She urged parents to look after their children at all times.
