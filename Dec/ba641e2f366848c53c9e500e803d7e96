    HE FOOLED an elderly woman to open her door by claiming that he was her grandson.Then he choked her, dragged her to her bedroom where he robbed her of her last R2 000, raped her and told her to take a bath before leaving.Little did he know that the old woman would be able to identify him.The incident happened on the evening of 29 November in Kromkuil, Winterveldt, in the north of Tshwane.The 24-year-old man lived nine houses away from hers and was caught by the community the day after he committed his evil deeds.The gogo said the man was handed to the police but she was shocked when she saw him walking the streets hardly an hour after his arrest.According to her 44-year-old grandson, they later learned that the suspect used R500 of the money he stole from gogo to buy his freedom.“He confessed to the community when they were baying for his blood, but he used R500 to bribe the cops, gave R1 000 to his younger brother and spent the rest of the money on himself before he fled.”He said when they went to inquire at Dube Police Station why the man was released, they were told that the shift that made the arrest had knocked off.The grandson said the attacker was known for preying on the elderly.He told Daily Sun they would not rest until justice had been served.The gogo told the SunTeam that the man hurt her deeply while raping her and her wish was for him to be arrested and sent to jail for life.“My stomach, punani and thighs are still very painful. It will take a long time for me to forget the way he continuously klapped me and ordered me to open my thighs wide open while he was on top of me.”A community member who did not wish to be named said the man’s family was also at fault because they always protected their naughty son.Dube police spokeswoman Sergeant Thembi Nowathe said no suspects had been arrested in the case, but a man was brought in for questioning. “Investigations are ongoing,” she said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvC8z0BhYLTQ57Cjn7aqQlU36aHEQCr1tzzU73vUEJcuzjZ300uELGqrl35SUseHzxR8b5NF-RnRXABfa_wkUBXjARX8TfTJiQUEH1JuYxUw2jq9U6vbnj-L1NpcoA4XaBYwbousVjtR9jZIi8DM7I52BJ6PuVgn-hFbAWWeTH3rRSsQCM-vB7MoDy-MelOyFI1I_Z2GMFBaRAYh4ycYLAn-HY5vxRNbHQF_9NJG4r71bQYjQ3N1LcG1ZbaUjv9D4UiGWLoJ4VUnrRSyL0P_7svRqczhEs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCtHPZbzWlrcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
