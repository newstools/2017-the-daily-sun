    The North Gauteng High Court has set aside the decision by NPA boss Shaun Abrahams to withdraw charges against his deputy Nomgcobo Jiba.This means Jiba must face charges of fraud and perjury for unlawfully authorising racketeering charges against former KZN Hawks boss Johan Booysen.Freedom Under Law's Nicole Fritz told News24 that the court also ruled that President Jacob Zuma should institute an inquiry into the conduct of Jiba and her colleague Lawrence Mrwebi.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv1p7KPGz8oDgSHBh8EGWp4WBoAdSBNjA26q2LA5vnnNBg1PLGKQDLA2VpsUR1t3lzwYlaqpr4CYWwAwYjNeK686Kw7urQOZ4ulNZGGcKO6R9SH7PvKJgjTI_W-KnXYzbHTx8Ne2yClTySxq1D_eqjSER7U9U1wQZBBlr6x5BwnCnAiiqDvky6RhwktVvEsuAVxmIX6o636lI_OA8v5bjlmGQK0ZqQ8wjNit9PzH2feNBNW_4tGVut1-GP3729QRIhNQjCPEOqufLMMC64ihIGKf_0ekLs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIwPjrLNgWrbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The charges related to her decision to prosecute Johan Booysen, the former head of the Hawks in KwaZulu-Natal, on racketeering charges.Last year Jiba and Mrwebi, were struck off the roll of advocates of the General Council of the Bar of SA.News24 reported at the time that this was over their handling of the case against former crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli.However, Jiba and Mrwebi were granted leave to appeal the decision in January this year, and the following month Zuma decided not to suspend her or to institute a commission of inquiry into her conduct.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/high-court-sets-aside-shaun-abrahams-decision-to-withdraw-charges-against-jiba-20171221
