Their book, due out in February, is titled Be an A Student.They realise that most children limit their potential, so the book is aimed at high school pupils and students at tertiary level. It will also be a valuable tool for teachers.In the chapter Be a Player, Not a Fan they encourage kids to cut down on TV watching and pay attention to their books.They advise readers to rub shoulders with successful people to find out how they made it in life. People must be competitive to be champions of life, say the duo.They have also produced a CD.
