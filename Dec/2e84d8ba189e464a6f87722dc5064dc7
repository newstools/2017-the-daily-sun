As a result, another case was opened.Bhembe said the patient will appear in the Piet Retief Magistrates Court on 4 January while the nurse’s brother will be arrested soon.In another incident, a nurse at Kanyamazane Clinic was allegedly assaulted by a group of five men who entered the clinic. They were with a friend and tried to force their way into the room where patients were being treated by nurses. The nurse sustained head injuries. Bhembe said the police will follow up to find out why a case was not opened.Health MEC Gillion Mashego said it is disappointing that there are people who assault nurses. “Nurses leave their families to attend to patients at night but then they are attacked.“I have instructed the nurses to open cases of assault with the police because these are criminal acts,” he said.“I will also talk to the department of community safety and security to see how we can strengthen security at health facilities, especially at night.”
