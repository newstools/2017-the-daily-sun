the house and whilst inside, he allegedly heard a gunshot."When peeping through the window, he allegedly noticed
four men wearing police bullet proof vests. The suspects then fled into the
nearby bushes, leaving the injured member and the state vehicle behind," Colonel
Moatshe Ngoepe said.Ngoepe said when the other cop finally got out of the house to
investigate, he found his colleague injured and lying on the ground.Meanwhile, investigations have revealed that the same
suspects allegedly broke into a house at Medipark in Tzaneen about 30 minutes
later.They ordered a man, his wife and a child at gun point to lay
on the floor before robbing them of a cell phone and a white Nissan Sentra.
