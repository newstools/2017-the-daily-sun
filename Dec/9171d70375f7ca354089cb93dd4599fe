Children are among the most vulnerable and many are in need of protection and support,” said Othman Belbeisi, the Organisation for Migration’s Libya chief of mission. Next year the organisation aims to assist 30 000 migrants return to their country of origin, among them migrant children.Abdel-Rahman Ghandour, the Children’s Fund special representative in Libya, said migrant children were some of the most vulnerable people in Libya.He welcomed the agreement. – CAJ NEWS
