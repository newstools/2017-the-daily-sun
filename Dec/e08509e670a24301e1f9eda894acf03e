She had R3 000 worth of stamps to buy food for her family for Christmas.Now her family faces a terrible Christmas without food.She also lost clothes she had bought for her grandchildren.Mumsy survives by selling snacks. She used to save some money to buy the stamps.When a shack caught fire at Jumpas squatter camp in Cleveland, Joburg, hers was not spared.“I don’t know what to do. I have to get material to fix my shack. It so difficult when you rely on selling things to survive because you don’t get customers all the time.”After her eldest daughter died, she was left to look after her four grandchildren.She said her daughter used to help her a lot. “We used to join hands in most things but now she’s gone.”She said her daughter died earlier this year after a long illness.“I’m overwhelmed. I don’t want to go around begging. I just need a boost to help me stand up. I’ve lost everything.“We live in difficult conditions in this squatter camp. When people fight, they sometimes burn shacks. We all live close together, so many others suffer as well.“That is why my six-roomed shack burned. I just thank the Almighty that no one died.”
