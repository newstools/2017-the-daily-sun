    TO ALLOW people leaving South Africa or coming into the country this festive season, Home Affairs has extended its operating hours at the borders. Stephen van Neel, chairman of the Border Management Authority, said in Pretoria yesterday that Home Affairs Minister Ayanda Dlodlo had extended the longer hours to 16 January.“Two ports of entry in Mpumalanga, namely Lebombo and Oshoek, will be open for six hours longer every day, while others across Mzansi will remain open longer for between one and three hours,” Van Neel said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstH2AJyqM5RCt7bRo2n655mWaLlL-T9_a2XD6rR5y1J0L9gd0QtPqXLnCb4ej4Nyk8Nb-hlK7lTjA6c470pkeVsBBhi4VJE2GKayTCDBLtlvwDfXyBnZgEddfu2l8F8ruXlR6U5VyQhC3FkhgAdNRYNFFANm4cRTW04YB5wjsRIAmhIFR1cTbYQ9Qju7l7N7TANojoet8KuOq8oWwE0CfLzSY6Kdv4cdfHX0zOGGcAoeIZJosZZ-wrh35PEHfCAH6o73n2wW2UKYpNCnFeRBKzjvHOf66U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLt7RXx1xfJnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Additional staff will be manning the border posts.“South Africa is surrounded by six countries. The movement of people and goods across borders is handled by many ports of entry.“Between 9 December 2015 and 12 January last year, 903 132 people moved into or out of the country.”The border posts linking South Africa to Lesotho and Zimbabwe were the busiest.The Border Management Authority was formed by Home Affairs earlier this year to clamp down on illegal immigration.
