Additional staff will be manning the border posts.“South Africa is surrounded by six countries. The movement of people and goods across borders is handled by many ports of entry.“Between 9 December 2015 and 12 January last year, 903 132 people moved into or out of the country.”The border posts linking South Africa to Lesotho and Zimbabwe were the busiest.The Border Management Authority was formed by Home Affairs earlier this year to clamp down on illegal immigration.
