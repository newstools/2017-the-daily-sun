Bongani told Daily Sun he is heartbroken because the clothes are now just ash. Luckily, the kids were not there as they were visiting relatives.He said when the fire started at about 6am, he had left for church, leaving one of his cousins, Sipho Mtombe, sleeping in the house. He shared the house with him.According to Bongani, Sipho died in the fire as he was fast asleep when the house was engulfed in flames.With the help of the neighbours the fire was put out, though it was already too late. Nothing was saved.Thabang Radebe, who also lives with Bongani, said he had gone to his recycling job and luckily it meant he had to wake up early. He only discovered the damage when he returned. They said all their things, including important documents, were lost in fire.Adding to their misery, nyaope addicts then came and looted them.
