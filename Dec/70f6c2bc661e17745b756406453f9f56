I’ll find you,” said 32-year-old Darren, who has opened a business in the Tshwane CBD.His business is only a month old but already clients are queuing for his services.Darren doesn’t come cheap. His starting fee is R8 000, and depending on how good your partner is at cheating, the fee might go up.“But he will follow your husband or wife and snap pictures of everyone they poke.“Most of the cases I’ve received are from girlfriends and wives who accuse their men of cheating,” he said.“When a client calls I ask for pictures of their partner and information about the places they go to, the cars they drive, their friends and family.“Some clients asked me to get evidence to prove cheating for divorce cases and those are the expensive ones.”Darren said he uses the latest gadgets to capture images and audios of the people he’s investigating.He said cheaters never see him coming.“They will never see or find me, but I’ll get them!”He was inspired by the sound clip of a Gagasi FM marriage proposal on the radio that went wrong.In the clip, a caller phoned in to Gagasi FM, meaning to propose to his loved one on the air.The loved one didn’t answer – but her boyfriend did. An argument between the two men broke out.Darren said that’s when he realised many people were being cheated on but didn’t know.“I thought I should use my skills as an investigator to make money while helping people catch dishonest partners.“I’m a trained investigator and I work hard to please my clients,” he said.“Since posting my ad on social media I’ve received many phone calls from people who need help.“I work with people in all the provinces. It doesn’t matter where your partner lives or works, we’ll find them.”Darren claimed he is so good that he has even caught his own girlfriends.“I always investigate my own girlfriends. I want to make sure they’re not doing anything stupid.”
