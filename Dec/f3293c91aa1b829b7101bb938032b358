    THE future looks bleak for Baroka FC head coach Kgoloko Thobejane!Bakgaga started the 2017-18 Absa Premiership season in impressive form, remaining at the top of the league table for more than two months. Football experts were even starting to compare Baroka with English Premiership side Leicester City, who shocked the world as relative unknowns by winning the 2015-16 English Premier League title.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTWAYYSvQVYxMDgZ5Y5cLYwNO3-cd6n0QBviM7Izan6-54wGJK8lRtV6Vl22a76Yz791WCSjwL-KvP819BVpFQnfA8KqyatZdwW1o8lGUSMSCDiPGyrMad_vv_Mw_CYZ5Oro1aAQTPZPE7uIGqSu9P0iBZT5YHxMhNoM6EI_uJlZ5NNFxoGHX9RdqT0vr9aViL-3x9wXcYXv2EqvwRmpfcm1oG20vHU0fXnyxgaUt3K9dIo3uCIS0guBjicep9J38mh-X1OfK-83xC8UPEgzJatw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMfJAYg3n_bPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They have 19 points from 14 matches. They were three points behind leaders Sundowns yesterday before Downs’ clash with Maritzburg at Loftus Versfeld last night.Club CEO Morgan Mammila told SunSport that Thobejane’s job was not safe. “Thobejane is still our head coach but his job is not guaranteed,” said Mammila. “No job is guaranteed in football, including those of management. If the team is not doing well, it’s not only the coach who could be fired, even the management can be fired. “Everyone knows football is all about results. But Thobejane is still our head coach, nothing has changed for the moment.” Many are expecting Kaizer Chiefs legend Doctor Khumalo to take over if Baroka are to part ways with Thobejane. Khumalo joined Baroka as technical director this season.The head coach could be shown the door if Baroka fail to beat SuperSport United in their final first round league match at Peter Mokaba on Sunday (3:30pm).Mammila also confirmed that they sacked their team manager, Jimmy Ngobeni, on Tuesday.“I am sure that people are aware that Jimmy works as a teacher full-time and part-time with us,” he said. “The club felt that they needed someone to work full-time in that position. We are a young team and need a young man or woman from our community to cover that job. Jimmy was not able to commit as he has another full-time job. But he did a great job and we appreciate that.” However, an insider in the team told SunSport that Ngobeni was fired because he allegedly went to mark matric papers for pupils in Limpopo.) Baroka were declared  Absa Premiership Quarter One winners yesterday. They won Q1 with 16 points – beating Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United, who finished second and third respectively.
