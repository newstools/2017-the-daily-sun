    FOR many people, Christmas is a day to be spent with family. But Mpho Mabuza ditched his family on Monday to protest in the street. The 37-year-old from Orlando East in Soweto stood alone with a placard reading “Prepaid meter must fall”. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVJUU5TskLlTz7yWdve78YDl1Y10aMnFu1e2-ltxA-gc1AItgOn6Bb8dG9mmaK0HfyrdkT8jypM_KL0wHUMS9oskUoUbHx9AbgJ67xVR3O9pPuxKCutrDmXBoPjiffj-QblN-i6k4jpkDtR5cs-fLItLgzqiXcqVBa5IROD4nwmwepHBSRiK_5X-yEUJ2OWx02BT-PnqQM4iX6FZZjq8vIGv-PbFa4uvsDv_EcRSq3UjXBfDVCt2mY2JdKMFhZsB6AXns9CPWdjJ5mcr8Rj4ppZTEM3PE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzF0JWuFjVP2lEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Each time a motorist asked him what he was doing, he would answer: “I’m protesting on behalf of Soweto residents. We want to be taken seriously. No decisions affecting us should be taken by the government or any other organisation without us being consulted first.” The SunTeam first noticed Mpho standing in the street at about 9am. In the afternoon he was still there. He said: “I left my wife and kids at home to come here and protest. We want to be heard.” Mpho said it was wrong for Eskom to make decisions without consulting residents. “I’m not saying people shouldn’t pay for services. They should have sat down with us to explain the process of installing prepaid meters before doing it,” he said. Soweto has seen many protests over prepaid meters in the past years. During some of the protests, roads were closed with burning tyres and rocks. Mpho said: “My protest is peaceful. All I need is for the message to reach the right people.”
