    LEANDRA Smeda is confident that Banyana Banyana will make history by claiming the prestigious Caf Women’s National Team of the Year award. The SA women’s team was among three teams shortlisted for the award on Monday alongside Nigeria and Ghana’s Under-20 national teams. Banyana had a great 2017, winning the Cosafa Women’s Championship in Zimbabwe in September. Desiree Ellis’ charges have yet to taste defeat this year – an incredible feat. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssDYLOfJCuC8EYBzj2oGdAYq_uxifWZyN6UgpqsH6_hzBufiyMRvWAa07rZrUAWeuUfBvveZmOPU4UdwUqg61az8geYeo_sPHkfDlyyrf849au3IRG9n_l3fXZykbybILp5HHIPsPSAjaOF1pRaVCFdd8xwilAbcylh4S6pzxRQSsH0TN6Yrqsd69hwlXZHDdY-uE7nOY4TZDd5tMCy5SIRZUIvRm9jCW8dHPVTb0Lh67oJWGXjCM_h_g8jHoeDB_Xnu4IY5az0GvGbdLPJ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNRUvB5H3Y-_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It shows that this year we had one of our best years yet. The recognition proves we’re getting something right,” said the veteran midfielder.Smeda was full of praise for her 21-year-old teammate Kgatlana, who took home the Player of the Tournament accolade at the Cosafa event.“I’m proud of Thembi – she has grown as a player and I believe she will go far.”Smeda added that winning the Caf accolade would be a mental boost for them as they face a hectic schedule next year. Banyana will start the year with two back-to-back friendlies against Sweden in Cape Town as part of their preparations for Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (Women’s Afcon) qualifiers.Said Smeda: “Winning the accolade could set the tone for us. We want to qualify for the Women’s Afcon and ensure that we finish in the top three. Many players in our team, myself included, have never played in a World Cup. That is something many of us want to achieve before our football careers are over.”
