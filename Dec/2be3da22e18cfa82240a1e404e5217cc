The store said we should identify the poorest victims because we had too many names,” said Koegelenberg.Store owner Abel Mponda said: “We wouldn’t be where we are without the community’s support. “That’s why we are happy to be part of the cops’ initiative.”Bhelekazi Mfundisi (36) from Ndlovini in Khayelitsha said she was grateful to the cops and the store for the food parcels. She has a family of five who depend on her son’s disability grant. “I was worried because we didn’t have enough food at home. Now we will enjoy Christmas just like everyone else,” she said.Harare police spokesman Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said they do not only focus on arresting criminals, but also on social issues.
