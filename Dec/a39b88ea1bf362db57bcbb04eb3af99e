    MADALA Mbuso Mkhize (73) has dreamt of living in a decent house his whole life.When President Jacob Zuma visited the area during his campaign in 2013, he promised the madala a decent home. But four years later, the madala is still living in a mud house at Snathing, Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands.Madala Mbuso, who needs a wheelchair to move around, has realised that the president was just campaigning.“He witnessed the conditions I live in. He promised he would build a house for me. He came with a councillor and gave the councillor the task of finding suitable land to build me a proper home.“I have no legs and one arm and I survive on a government grant. I am so sad that the councillor never got back to me.”Councillor Sipho Madonda confirmed that the president had visited Mkhize.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssaRPwevJerVw8FgLDVi9sK77ME2lb7Fc7n_CDP_dQ20HTDASrSzyoYN9yNVHg0qupc1L5VBhMNGFXmHdnSEuyb5upF6dGAfq2pkcBDLRkCGv3oZ_EyKiFu2w0X2VSZlsNG1sHEGF6SfcTu-vWwC6YvPsPtV3vlQJvuOFvot_6nfKIy_V4Nn9Vf-JJh9C6Q2gTvP2NZ78-WPRQZbMQhsLsP1NAhcSpqDo3_STiMDZ9Ds4SL9yxXSopq2tXS0Pf4GJzZf7aFe2CND6WDq095ZxQCWfc49UI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJQWF6rYclDnEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

That’s why building his house has been delayed.”However, Mkhize denied Madonda’s claims. He said: “No one ever came to me after Zuma’s visit. He is lying when he says he told me about the land and that I didn’t like it.”Zuma’s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said: “I’ll check all the facts when the president is finished at the conference.”Disable man Mbuso Mkhize's mud house.
