She says even though she doesn't have formal education, but she has managed to make a living through her art work and also help the community by creating jobs.Despite producing the Xibelani, Sophie also  makes beaded necklaces, waist laces called Ti-queen and traditional jewellery. “I want the local municipality and the Department of Art and Culture help me to sell my products outside the country, by doing so I will contribute to preserving my culture through art” Sophie said.Manyunyu Ngoveni (23) said since she joined Sophie over the past two years, she has not only found employment but she also received a skill which will sustain her life .She also highly praised Sophie, by saying she is God's gift to the rural community.
