ANC president, said the National Development Plan needed to be implemented
"with energy as well as with great urgency"."Our Vision 2030 remains the blueprint for inclusive
growth, social cohesion and prosperity for all. Under this plan we will
continue to develop skills that can help our country realise its developmental
goals and address labour market issues," he said.Ramaphosa said more skilled managers, professionals,
technicians, engineers and artisans."We therefore encourage those who will be receiving
their matric results in the next few days to investigate the possibilities that
await them at universities, TVET colleges as well as community colleges,"
he said. During the country's 23 years of democracy, government,
social partners and active citizens have created a South Africa where the
provision of social services and amenities has helped to confront the legacy of
apartheid, he said."New schools, hospitals, clinics, factories,
bridges, dams and airports tell the story of a South Africa that has indeed
moved forward," he said.He said 2017 was a year in which, despite progress in
many important areas that government has made, they continued to see the
devastating effect of unemployment on individuals, families and communities."That is why, as we reflect on the achievements and
challenges of the last year, we must reaffirm our determination to build an
economy that serves all our people," he said.Ramaphosa said it was a special honour for him to join
South Africans on the eve of Christmas 2017, "at a time when all of us are
devoting our attention to family and friends and celebrating the season of
goodwill and peace".  http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-determined-to-build-an-economy-that-serves-all-people-20171224
