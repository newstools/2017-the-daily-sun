Simphiwe is a peer monitor and student representative council member.He earns a living by juggling sticks on street corners. It helps him to buy food and school stationery.“I even bought myself a school blazer with the money that I made.” Simphiwe said he simply won’t allow poverty to change his dreams.“I started juggling sticks three years ago to try and make some pocket money so I can eat at school.“I do this every weekend because during the week I’m at school.“I don’t want to be different from other pupils because I have no family. I would like to change my situation for the best, and I know education is the only way.” The grade 10 pupil at Unity Secondary School lives alone in his shack but sometimes gets hand-outs from kind community members.“My friends and the community are my pillars of strength,” he said.“I have learnt in life that if you’re born poor, you don’t have to live and die that way.“You can break the vicious cycle by focusing on your dreams.” The highly motivated young man said one day he’d like to study law and become a hot shot lawyer.
