My bones are never wrong and never will be,” he said.“It was a tough competition but Cyril will come out at the the end as our new leader. Speaking to Daily Sun, Mahlinza Dlamini said Cyril Ramaphosa is the people’s choice.“Mzansi people love Ramaphosa,” he said.“The nation is not yet ready to be led by a woman.”Chairman of eThekwini Traditional Healers, Thandonjani Hlongwane also said that according to his bones, Cyril Ramaphosa would win.Yesterday, Jessie Duarte, deputy secretary-general of the ANC, told reporters at a briefing after the adoption of delegates’ credentials: “We had to disqualify delegates across the board who did not pass verification.” She said a few delegates from the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape who were disqualified were later registered after successful appeals.Duarte said the numbers had not been inflated, as was widely reported in the media. She said the number of delegates as adopted during credentials stood at about 4 700.“According to credentials adopted, 4 776 members will vote at this conference and the winning candidate will need 2 389 votes.”
