It’s mine. It’s none of your business to monitor what I drink,” said a boy who was carrying a three-litre box of wine.They claimed their parents gave them money and they knew it was not for sweets, but booze.Cape Town councillor Jean-Pierre Smith issued a stern warning to shebeen owners who sell booze to underage kids.“This is a serious criminal offence,” Smith said. “If anyone knows a shebeen that sells alcohol to underage kids, they must call the city’s call centre.”He said a shebeen could lose its licence for selling booze to minors.Ester Lewis, a social development spokeswoman, said: “It’s illegal to sell alcohol to young kids and shebeens know it is not allowed. “We discourage young people from abusing alcohol.”Banetsi Mphunga from Township Parents and Children’s Health Centre, an NGO that deals with vulnerable kids, said parents must know what their kids get up to during this time of the year. “It is a parent’s responsibility to know where their kids are and what they are doing.”Residents had mixed feelings, with some condemning and others saying the kids should be left alone.Resident Mandisa Mjajubana said: “These kids must be stopped from abusing booze. “It will lead them to rob people to get money for it.”Another resident, Sabelo Mchiza, said: “It’s the festive season. Let them enjoy themselves. They are kids, after all.”
