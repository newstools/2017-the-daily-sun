The ceremony will include the collection of the souls of MK members who died in exile and were never found or brought back home. Majiya said they were hopeful the ceremony won’t only end the violence that’s tearing KZN apart, but would bring unity and stability within the ANC. Mavundla said they asked Mduduzi to be involved as he has special powers to fetch the spirits of dead people.Apparently, Mduduzi could do this by calling the spirits even if he was not at the site where the people died.
