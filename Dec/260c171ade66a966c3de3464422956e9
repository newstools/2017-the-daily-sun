We fought even more,” he said.In the end Monica ended up leaving him.He said he went back to the sangoma and told her what had happened. “She said that she had made a mistake ,” said Shadrack.The SunTeam spoke to Monica, who was fine until Shadrack’s name was mentioned.“He just irritates me. Don’t call me if you are going to mention that name,” she said as she dropped the call.The sangoma, who is known to Daily Sun only as Sgegede, refused to comment.Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said once muthi had been used it was very hard to reverse the consequences.He said: “But Shadrack can still be helped. He just needs a powerful sangoma.”
