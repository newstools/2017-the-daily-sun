    DESPITE his frequent complaints about their goal-scoring drought, it remains unclear if Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt will venture into the January transfer market for a proven goal-scorer. One thing is clear, though, Hunt has been let down by his trusted soldiers in their Absa Premiership campaign. Wits are the laughing-stock of South African football, languishing at the bottom of the table just a few months after winning their maiden Premiership title.  The defending champions are rooted to the bottom of the standings with 10 points from 12 matches. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstwlCCErHeqefZyfiQ_flfkgT-zx-QccGkibfqHZV8CjgYbgVtGtopDxUA7UNVs043phzRWbpIAitAhF1B9nCUWJOotbymHEIIWnqfHaahGCK4ifxtSogEx4iTgbwSOiSY-5Fs3EIOL3kvz3dDd5XRi2mltjn9tyJtQrGxzi4TkXnbYxGr38hAti8YAVl4AUzIVg-zzTBaHwN-Z9H6jXilqR4ny-YWSfJ6xaBF_vYAiohPbgvZTEAd29Fk7LqeXU_u2ag2AVFz0--gKKoL8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBmExsuVqBdNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Big-name signings Steven Pienaar and Daylon Claasen are still struggling to find their feet in the club’s hour of need. The coach will be wondering how much longer he has to wait for them to find form while the club’s league situation deteriorates with every passing game. The only players exhibiting signs of having some fight left in them are Daine Klate and new 26-year-old signing from Egypt Amr Gamal, who has scored two league goals. All other contributions have been singles. Sign of Wits’ impending demise cannot be ignored. Hunt has now been forced to act. Wits visit wounded Polokwane City in a must-win clash at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Hunt said: “We are not scoring and it is affecting us badly. We have to work ourselves out of this situation. It’s crazy. I’m worried – everybody is worried. “Where am I going to get a striker? It’s not like anyone is scoring goals in the PSL at the moment. But I’m thinking about it. . . ” In times like these Pienaar and Claasen should be carrying the team, but they are off form. Hunt said: “Apparently they are still fitting in, I don’t know how long it will take. But I hope it won’t be forever.” Hunt will take some comfort from the fact that not only Wits but many of the other teams are inconsistent in the league, with results heavy on the draws after each round.
