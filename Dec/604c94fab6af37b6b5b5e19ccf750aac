He is accused of killing his nephew, Kamvelihle Ngala (4) at their home in Kwantsila Village.He is charged with cannibalism and child slaughter for having skinned his nephew, drunk his blood and eaten his heart and brains.The shocking, gruesome murder which rocked the province happened on Easter Monday. During his first court appearance, Mandisa told a magistrate he wanted to be sentenced and serve his term, and pleaded guilty to all charges. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesman Luxolo Tyali said. “The magistrate is not in a position to finalise a murder case.“It was transferred to a regional court where the decision of the director of Public Prosecutions will be endorsed.”
