Chief Khoisan SA, Christian Martin, Shane Plaatjies and Brendon Billings arrived on 30 November, after walking from Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, to get attention for their cause. The activists want the Khoisan to be recognised as the first people of Mzansi, their language to be given official status, and the 1913 land claims to be scrapped. The fast ended on Sunday, when Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa received a memorandum on behalf of President Jacob Zuma. Chief Khoisan SA said they were happy the deputy president came to see them. “He came and signed the memorandum. We will be able to be with our families.” He said their cause had all South Africans’ support. “We’re happy because a lot of people have visited us.” Ramaphosa said the memorandum would be given the necessary consideration, and he told them about the bill that recognises the Khoisan and their heritage.He said the next step is submission of the bill to the National Council of Provinces.
