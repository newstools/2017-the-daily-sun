De Bruyn said young people must continue where they had left off.“We are handing over the baton to you. You’re equipped and educated,” she said.“Today, you have all the gimmicks that we didn’t have, so you stand a better chance.”Retired football players Kalusha Bwalya, Lucas Radebe and Aaron Mokoena took part in the run.Radebe said: “It’s important to recognise icons that have made a great contribution to our country.”The winner of the 10km run was Rildo Mhanderwa (22) from Zimbabwe.“I flew in three weeks ago just to take part in this race.
