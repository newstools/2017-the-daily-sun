    CHIPPA United boss Siviwe Mpengesi has now cast his net beyond South Africa’s borders in search of a top class striker.Mpengesi told SunSport they could not find what they were looking for locally, considering that many strikers in the PSL are going through a dry spell.This goal drought has caused an outcry among Mzansi’s legendary footballers including Jerry “Legs of Thunder” Sikhosana, who scored an avalanche of goals in his stint with Orlando Pirates.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss9e_bMLCLz7LEmorGeHKeIVaxWiZTGYsUt-fTZSAHQ6Cxepu_juMqBSdrT9rOkau2bVuZxQoE__m1-grMvhPNyVfJTfh4V6todHeMF5_AD_Jt_EmSAl9mf5QEULs4AFBFNOyITLIrT9oeyCtKnC-vVaBKZCZioZq0VykbE8sIcj1cXQ-kz2Iq8noQLCemwkDJbQtZNhn4Trw1J8k0qHdNz17T2UM5eNCIgIqgQPSbvSs3a0I5MiU_bMmpSQCHjwzM1uzyOsoVcn5QsPYvX\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK0gtW4n89lPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Golden Arrows have drawn eight.Said Mpengesi: “We have decided to look outside the country because we could not find the type of striker we need locally. We have one spot open for a foreigner. “The local strikers have been going through a rough patch and that makes it difficult to sign someone who might need longer to adapt and start scoring goals. We need someone who will hit the ground running to help us finish the season in a better position than we did last season.”Mpengesi revealed that they have given up on their mission to lure out-of-favour Kaizer Chiefs winger William Twala back to their stable. The speedy player has struggled to obtain a regular place in Steve Komphela’s lineup this season. Speculation is rife that Twala will join Free State Stars in the January transfer window in a swap deal that will see Sinethemba Jantjie wear the gold and black jersey. “It would be nice to have Twala back, but we can’t afford to pay his huge salary.”But Chiefs boss Bobby Motaung says the technical staff have yet to decide which players they will release.“We’ll make an announcement when the time is right.”
