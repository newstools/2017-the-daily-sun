    RICHARDS Bay FC chairman Sifiso “Jomo” Biyela says the dark cloud that hovered over his struggling team is history now. The National First Division (NFD) newcomers had a tough time in the league after buying AmaZulu’s NFD status in July.They have won only two games so far – their most recent victory coming at the weekend when they beat Black Leopards 2-1 to go into the Christmas break in 14th position with 13points from 15 matches.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuYbZbtjGPdCru5G4rs-qhYSgEedxBIQYGz1CLX-Gr6WZEoc1UC3IXxpZ72-mfAIthj2-sGt-C5b9w-DfJN9T-l4EKBWRtsHIiSDP7klCDtRog4Ym1HsSQVZ6BUnR5zzN75EyTw5u2RywkImGGf1q1GBQb1Hftld7glmOAX9PiN3VHxf_-JSrKuAWp_pdBDmVXGXs022CwCNuDqMM81UyUU_0zsTPnL_S9ncw30aoWPyD_0HJr_dZk7BeeTtNCv649qEduGNIa94M7mRjcB\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLvE-AEAOR9EEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

There are teams in this division that have been here for many years without ever getting promotion. We can’t be expected to win the league title in our first season. Still, I think the dark cloud has passed for us now.”Rich Boys started the season with Roger Sikhakhane as their head coach, but he resigned in October due to poor results. The position was filled by his assistant Sello Ntuli on an interim basis. Biyela appointed former Leopards mentor Jean Francois Losciuto as the new head coach in November. The club chairman said changes had to be made for the team to succeed.“We identified the problem, changes had to be made. Those changes are starting to show good results. “People must understand that it takes a lot to build a team. At the moment things are going the way I want them to go,” said Biyela. He said it was unfair for people to compare his team to Thanda Royal Zulu. He aims to venture into the transfer market in January to sign two or three players, especially in the striking department where his team is lacking.
