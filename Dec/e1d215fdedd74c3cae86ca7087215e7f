    RESIDENTS believed the thug used muthi to make them fall asleep so he could rob them.  But the police wouldn’t believe them. So on Monday, the residents of Poortjie in Orange Farm, south of Joburg decided to take matters into their own hands and find the robber.They went from house to house to look for him. In one of the houses, a resident recognised something that belonged to him which had gone missing about a week earlier. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuPoz8pcXISBYz08OaPaqXPtUhOwt8bS2mgSBAdCxfWdzgCn0GRfZXytEDaz7PVzJn8yNRDrqlx03DieJ0t8WQAd78K924pBBAJfEWyPfa-HlQffAQPxx7-ZI7Ypxs_-8stL-9YA6T1c8JI3FlS-pfxjg8TJ5ECQbL63tO-yD0Bz3WW9q3_9VPKxV38L15Cl96h1LWLmLRGun-wQbTDsjy7qcfh_TjcF8qg8Faib5_ygLoV-L3xAb7E6oy6dTbJyKiMEeNXahSHFOP4PxMAXDhaw71531g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJMofJpuzXpkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Our lost car keys, licences, IDs, car batteries, laptops and clothes,” said Mbuyiseni Moloi (40).The residents started beating the owner of the house. However, cops were quick to arrive and the man was rescued.Residents told Daily Sun the thug used muthi to make them fall asleep when he entered their homes. They said they reported the incidents to the police but received no help.“We don’t want him here. The police should find another place for him,” said a resident. Maureen Shilenge (30) said she bought Christmas clothes for her two children. But two weeks ago she fell into a deep sleep and the next morning the clothes were gone.“Nothing was stolen except my kids’ clothes,” she said.“I was so happy when we raided the man’s house and found our goods, including the clothes.” She said their area used to be peaceful but recently it changed.SAPS spokesman Captain Johannes Motsiri confirmed a man was beaten up by the community and said he was rescued by the police.He said the man recovered in hospital and opened a case of assault against those who assaulted him.
