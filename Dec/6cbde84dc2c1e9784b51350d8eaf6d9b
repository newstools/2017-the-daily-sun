    BIDVEST Wits’ new “golden boy” Vincent Pule is determined to help the Absa Premiership champions get their league season back on track.Pule, who scored that sensational wonder goal in the last minute of the Telkom Knockout final against Bloemfontein Celtic in Durban at the weekend, earning the Clever Boys the TKO trophy for the first time, is bubbling with confidence ahead of tonight’s “six-pointer” against fellow-strugglers Ajax Cape Town at Bidvest Stadium (7.30pm).While Pule’s confidence is sky high after his heroics with that back heel goal, he will not be putting himself under pressure. Said the player: “I’m really happy with that goal. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsudkJRDD4cmkTQedgiY404jOPRVKqgYqd-JnfQSErhc0KGNSJPimJiurTtackmXkMHYztHFIhJm123ylSz-fe8i7_Eu9zVsoy7htxzct2_jR6LAa25kUbYaE0zggZbAi3C2l0g1BpOts66TNTy51ZNJV4epl2S3ANvuuGrE567ZwQrE0MLIYMgo1mY90D0_8bj1OreKvPMHzFtkdly-VGIbtah3vIvxm2O1hay8Pr2UpbVy2eOzbmrZCi4iTiDm1YZClAfFBaaZyTluYf1H\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJMSS9ErFcHgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We’re in a good space with the spirits high.“It was amazing when coach Gavin (Hunt) hugged me afterwards. He said that had Lionel Messi scored such a goal, it would be the goal of the season. That was a boost from the coach, who also said I nearly gave him a heart attack with the back heel!”Pule added that he was enjoying his football at Wits: “I’ve been here for four seasons and I’ve have been improving since I got here.”But Wits, who are bottom of the table with nine points, the same number as Ajax, will not be basking in the glory of winning the TKO.Stressed Pule: “The cup is history. Now we have to start getting league points and climb back up the table. Our league season has not been good.”He pointed out that defending the Premiership was not out of Wits’ reach: “There are 10 points between us and Baroka, who are top. So if we win two or three games we’ll be right back in the race.”Pule said the fact that both centre backs, skipper Thulani “Tyson” Hlatshwayo and Buhle Mkhwanazi, were back from injury had made the world of difference.“Tyson and Buhle have a tremendous understanding. They are a great partnership and since their return to action we have kept two successive clean sheets, something we could not do when they were injured. We need to keep a clean sheet against Ajax.“I believe that having both defenders and goalkeeper Darren Keet back also boosted the squad.” Pule warned that the Urban Warriors will be no pushovers: “I rate them as a very good side with a powerful attack. They won’t be easy opponents.”
