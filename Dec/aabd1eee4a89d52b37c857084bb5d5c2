    THE taxi industry may refuse to take on the minimum wage set by the labour department. The South African National Taxi Council said the taxi industry was a unique sector and the department should consult operators before making any decisions. The labour department released the minimum wage for the taxi sector earlier this year. According to the department, drivers’ salaries should increase from R3 207 a month to R3 413. If the owner wants the driver to sleep over somewhere, he must be paid an allowance of R372 or be given accommodation. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTpJuXxRkbHVkPQrO9easQirV2fGbXA2t_oR1_jvekrazD81gs7QoLQINyabOosZeWIjJPMCA-t3N-gOjhOAf49FsYGgroLJIkZXXqoIwh_lj-84iNlnoyvInm156HrJbQ6hr1QGnNao0vJhAstNB41DFkh2DSf5yJ7uZpEG0UXCi5Vu5ARCG55AALqIjtsklOqwOx_NBCOGR78F-LLgQAm1muMjlwd6Ildxw0tPoAJjYwgnvaH07xQbP3KyVywdGKzL67qXJKo8MSY4lmYNhJcU-d8EU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDzcUn5W3pF0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

However, taxi operators should have been consulted as this is a unique industry and you cannot have a uniform minimum wage.” He said the problem was that different areas had different taxi fares and a minimum wage might lead to losses for one taxi operator while benefitting others. Molelekwa said subsidies from the transport department would ease the pressure. The taxi industry currently doesn’t receive public passenger transport subsidies. “The impounding of taxis for at least three days also leads to a loss of income and this will result in us struggling to meet the minimum wage. Operators may be reluctant to comply,” he said. However, transport spokesman Ishmael Mnisi said the issues of transport subsidies and a minimum wage couldn’t be linked. He said taxi operators had to do what the labour department had instructed. “The subsidy review is underway and it has nothing to do with routes, whether short or long distance. They need to comply.”
