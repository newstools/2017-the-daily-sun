The music system used for church music was also taken.The four neatly dressed thugs loaded their loot into a silver-grey Polo and vanished into the night. When nearby residents rushed to the church they found almost everything in the church splattered with blood.Residents said the sound of the guns was deafening.“After the shooting, we thought everyone was dead because it was suddenly quiet. Then the screaming started. That is when went to investigate,” said one resident.Ambulances were called and the injured were taken to the Pholosong Hospital in Tsakane. The staff at the hospital had their hands full, rushing the critically wounded to the wards and giving treatment to those who had sustained more minor injuries.The church pastor, Jonathan Dlamini, said they always welcomed visitors, but this time they did not know they had invited the devil inside.“We’ll pray for those thugs. Yes, we have been traumatised as this was not expected. But we leave it in the hands of God.”Captain Thabo Sibuyi confirmed the incident and said the cop were hunting for the suspects riding in a silver-grey VW Polo.Anyone who has information is asked to contact 08600 10111 or visit KwaThema police station.
