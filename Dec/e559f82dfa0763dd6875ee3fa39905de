Social media users are asked for certain information to qualify for a share of 50% in the transaction. Dlodlo said: “Social media networks are critical platforms for information flow and exchange around the world but they are dangerous hunting grounds for cyber criminals.”She said they use the easy access of these networks for their criminal deeds. “The department will never ask people to pay money through social media for any of their services and anyone who comes across such requests should report them to the authorities.“We would like to warn those who are involved in this illegal activity that the law will come down hard on them.” Dlodlo has urged people who want to access online services offered by the department of home affairs to always check their sources and computer services, using the security mechanisms provided by the department.
