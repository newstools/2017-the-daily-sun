    The Constitutional Court is expected to hand down judgment on Friday in the case brought by the EFF, UDM and COPE against the Speaker of the National Assembly to compel the House to carry out its constitutional functions and scrutinise President Jacob Zuma's conduct.The application was argued in court in September after the opposition parties argued that the court should order Parliament to establish a fact-finding ad hoc committee that would force Zuma to answer questions about his conduct during the Nkandla scandal.The opposition parties are seeking a declaratory order that the National Assembly's inaction in the face of Zuma's violations of the Constitution was unconstitutional. They also want an order which would compel Speaker Baleka Mbete to take the necessary and appropriate steps to determine the seriousness of the president's violations.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuWZ2zcB1OLmryc0QbhwcLcso8pwqpOW7JIQrll7Zp_nLxyNj5mWeKQ1rh2gcDVr5OxJTAvRZSlLlmbaP_Z-qlc_Dl8ICAtQfAJ2vdFWVXkLj8QAj6p4N7hObkIpP3WXBFez5gXpH-0NWAM4UUVczlVShDdEDGPukCRSX8f1nzy5dkIyfchIu7j-9q9POdrySb3Tx61aEJu9gGc8eEHk2E5MNrjB8RtwxMAQemyz3j9-LBCUM3TbWfdeMUKfqmtwIsZVse-DDImYdtqpTCAG8DeI8uV4t4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCJy8BCB1QgyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

[It] would be inconsistent with separation of powers."Advocate Dali Mpofu, representing the UDM and COPE, said he believed that a fact-finding inquiry would force Zuma to account for his actions."In an inquiry nobody is going to ask you to sit down or raise a point of order," he said during arguments in September.Mpofu said the inquiry would be an opportunity for Zuma to answer questions."Nobody is going to tell you that that question had been answered. Nobody is going to switch off the mic. We are coming to the court to say the correct process is that there must be an inquiry," he said.
