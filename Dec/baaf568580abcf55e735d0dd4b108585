You’re the guy who has a duty to look after the lives. You’re a head of department.”The suspended head of the Gauteng health department was testifying at the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearing in Parktown, Joburg, after challenging his subpoena to take the witness stand.His application was dismissed by the South Gauteng High Court.Selebano is one of the three important witnesses identified by the tribunal to have authorised the Marathon Project that led to the deaths of mental care patients after the department terminated its contract with Life Esidimeni.Selebano told the hearing he could not stop the project. He said he closed the NGOs himself and all he could do was to make sure no more lives were lost.“I now know patients were moved very quickly and the preparations were not up to scratch,” he said.Mentally ill patients were quickly moved, some in open bakkies, to ill-equipped NGOs, and 143 patients died.Selebano said he was under pressure from former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu.“It was a departmental decision to have all contracts terminated because of the fiscal pressure after the national treasury told us there was no money,” said Selebano.He said the NGOs used the opportunity to make money. The Marathon Plan was prepared and presented by the former mental health director, Dr Makgabo Manamela, and he only approved it.Evidence Advocate Patrick Ngutshana read out portions of Selebano’s affidavit during his cross- examination.Selebano indicated the department was unfair to send too many patients to NGOs that were incapable of handling them.“NGOs were pressurised by implementors to take more people,” said Selebano.Ngutshana asked: “Who are these implementors? Will Manamela fit on this team?”Selebano answered: “As the leader of the team, yes.”When asked why NGOs didn’t refuse, Selebano said: “People take more than they can handle so they can get money.”He further said it was Manamela’s job to find places for patients.“The pressure was coming from the MEC to place patients in NGOs,” added Selebano.However, Selebano distanced himself from the operational level of the Marathon Project.His testimony continues today.
