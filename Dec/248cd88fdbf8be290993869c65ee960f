that an application to interdict the Eastern Cape elective conference, which
had already concluded by then, was struck off the roll by the High Court,
sitting in East London. Eight delegates were injured when violence broke out at the
conference. Delegates hurled chairs at each other, in what Deputy
President Cyril Ramaphosa described as a "festival of chairs". This came after members disrupted events two nights before,
while others who attempted to storm the venue the next evening had to be
dispersed with stun grenades.News24
