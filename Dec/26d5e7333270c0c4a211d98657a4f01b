Zandile said their misery began in 2004 when the house started developing cracks.“I went to report the matter to the former ward councillor, who came to assess the house and promised to help.”She said she kept going to the councillor’s offices to remind him, but nothing happened. “But his term ended without our house getting fixed.” Zandile said she hasn’t reported the matter to the new councillor as she didn’t know where he lived.“I’d like to have my house rebuilt before it collapses on us.” Former ward councillor Mxolisi Ndzimbomvu said the matter was referred to the municipality’s housing unit.Municipal spokesman Tozi Mthethwa said: “An application for funding to conduct renovation of houses in Waterloo was made to the provincial Department of Human Settlements in September. “The eThekwini human settlements unit is waiting for approval.”KZN human settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said the municipality needed to ask the National Home Builders Registration Council to assess the house.The project is no longer theirs.“The council will recommend whether the house should be reconstructed or the affected section be repaired.”
