    THE Constitutional Court has found that Parliament failed
to hold President Jacob Zuma to account for not upholding the Constitution in
the Nkandla matter."The failure by the National Assembly to determine
whether the president has breached section 89, subsection 1 (a) or (b) of the
Constitution, is inconsistent with this section and section 42(3) of the
Constitution," Justice Chris Jafta said today.Section 89 of the Constitution deals with the removal of
the president on the grounds of a serious violation of the Constitution or the
law, serious misconduct, or inability to perform the functions of office.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvTrymx2KJYK-GrRd07S7GLo9U2TsZ8-mgPyLQkMw0csyZz6KBoIFwBUkUeybjkPk6LeRHQdFoS2JwcCUBidoIiKadaZqHWft8ToKN67BenKZhJhLkENVlbTHLfvGVoaJtnKGdvRawjywjEyCD9oFSEUTZpE3G8PBbR-IzFTm1hy1YRiYHhTvv-1awpC6G3W4gUzW9VQIjhUohc1D9jKplf1H8zrESmFCGgov5nCTdGFEJniw2jedx9Lckh7HLL1oKw3tLbf5-YmekY5h6MxmQhg0uJqyM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNi-7JpnsqnMEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

failed to make rules surrounding the removal of the president, and had to
attend to this and hold the president to account "without delay".Zuma and the National Assembly were also ordered to pay
costs.However, Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng strongly disagreed
and said in a minority judgment that the ruling went against the principle of the
separation of powers."The majority has imposed its preference on
Parliament in circumstances where separation of powers forbade it,"
Mogoeng said in his judgment, which he asked Jafta to read into the record in
full.The case related to a previous judgment by the
Constitutional Court that Zuma "failed to uphold, defend and respect the
Constitution" with regards to the Public Protector's remedial action
against him over the upgrades to his Nkandla home.The current case relating to impeachment proceedings was
brought by the EFF, the UDM and COPE against the Speaker of the National
Assembly to force Parliament to carry out its Constitutional functions and look
closely at Zuma's conduct.Â http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/national-assembly-failed-to-hold-zuma-to-account-concourt-rules-20171229
