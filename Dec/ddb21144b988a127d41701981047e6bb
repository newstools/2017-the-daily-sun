    TEBOHO Moloi has big ambitions for Chippa United in the second half of the season but is determined to end 2017 on a high note.Moloi, the former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana star, has shone since taking charge of the Chilli Boys from his former Bucs teammate Dan “Dance” Malesela in September.He broke a club record of 10 games unbeaten which ended with a 1-0 away loss to Ajax Cape Town at the weekend.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss3ypfpMY9CgfODQF3EQP-W_fGfhN_X9Y-N0mqm89v8DBZV965hQqCmFZrzAklNRRcZVyvO_2ZJ5ZDpfBYhPjwYm3ZtIS57AqzO-CdSPs8piXV7AlbQ5s76Mqn3MCYqjn6CI9qYhi9aJnNs0D8E9jQL02LR7fs5sk2QnQzz_DkGrTtF73NAWYP0WVMDFvkcunIVZGKeHBEqem4NTwTUyFm5RrQPIQItAfe6LQzSyJj2s32_JwWtWMrvpYgljYqSZBBZBXQMRVV_ymfulIEmunSmVA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBr6frDqwSJjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It’s something he is trying to instil in his Chippa squad. He is a perfectionist: “When I played it was different. There was no social media, the financial rewards were not as high as today. I used to work after training on crosses and improving my game. “If I was able to make a pass to a teammate’s feet I expected him to be able to do the same. But I accept that players have greater challenges today than when I played. “We have an exciting group of players at Chippa who have the skills. I keep telling them I want goals.”Moloi is more focused on Rise and Shine: “They play more or less the same as us. I want to finish the year with 22 points.”The 49-year-old says he wants his side to continue playing their attacking brand of football but stressed: “It’s important to entertain but we must make sure we get the ball into the back of the net.”Moloi understands what Rise and Shine coach Bernard Molekwa’s approach will be: “Bernard will be compact playing away. I know he will be looking for at least a point.  We can’t allow dangermen like Rodney Ramagalela and Rendani Ndou to catch us on the break. We have to close them down quickly and not allow Ndivhuwo Ravhuhali to take shots from range. One thing is for sure, fans can look forward to an interesting and difficult game.” Moloi is looking for a central midfielder and striker to beef up his squad and will go scouting in the transfer market in January.
