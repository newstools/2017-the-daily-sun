But the case didn’t even make it to trial and the suspect is still walking the streets. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssJ4edfpsZWHJTmr_A4xfenj9FPrIc1J67_B5xamW3G6vN3RpEmoAY4EdOfsss3mLz7DfQ6e8Oo5WYFrHBzsxeyuTqEuSIjuupErPqVGpNvujJ6ZRxtsCMB4Z9svoQ1RKbIxxuDLkX5CtcY0lGjedCnH2poWUdXH86A04tDrtbSiE9HH5v9TxgZTMuwZ6AoHk-r2XhsC0x2dxfpfk5kLPVtS9iR8tBnytK72UEZmQyxHeGUGAwgCGlRj_zMUSYhfuft4Gdx010sJLlujs7hKdCn-kgausE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGm2SIsx30HTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Thoko (36) from Osizweni in Newcastle, northern KZN, said the body of her brother Thulani was found burnt beyond recognition in his house in July.“We knew he was murdered because he could not have remained still in bed while his house was on fire,” she said.Thoko said a suspect was arrested by Osizweni cops after the funeral. He allegedly confessed to hacking Thulani to death with an axe before setting his bed alight. But two weeks ago, Thoko said they were shocked when they were told by the suspect’s family that the case had been withdrawn. “I went to Osizweni Police Station and the station commander confirmed it,” she said. “He said Thulani’s corpse may be exhumed to conduct tests so his DNA can be matched against the blood found on the weapon and the suspect’s T-shirt.”KZN police spokesman Thulani Zwane said: “Once enough evidence is collected, the matter will be taken back to court.”
