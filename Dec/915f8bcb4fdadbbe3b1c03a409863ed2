The protesters were demanding that Royal Bafokeng Platinum Mine explain why certain workers were given the boot.Some believe it had to do with unsettled utility bills.Protester Tlhalefang Mpete said: “The municipality said we have unpaid water bills, but I can’t tell you why more than 30 mine employees living on the estate have been dismissed. We have tried, and failed, to get answers.”Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said cases of public violence and attempted murder had been opened.“The protesters allegedly blocked roads. No arrests have been made.” Mpueleng Pooe, the mine’s spokesman, said: “I am waiting for the team at the mine to give me all the facts. “Employees have channels to challenge such dismissals if they believe they were treated unfairly.”Pooe said he was awaiting a report from the mine regarding the shooting.
