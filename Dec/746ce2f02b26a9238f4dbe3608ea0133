The brigadier, who has qualifications in forensic science and law, said people in these units regularly have to go for psychological counselling.“Being the first person to inspect the body of a murdered or raped child is something no parent wants to do. “You immediately think of your own daughter. But at the end of the day, you have to collect evidence so suspects can be arrested.” Bhengu said they also have to be part of post mortem examinations.“Seeing a dead person being worked on is no small thing. There you have to put the issue of gender aside. The working hours are also very strange,” he said.But Bhengu took pride in the way forensic experts can use evidence to solve the most complicated of crimes.“That gives us confidence,” said the brigadier.
