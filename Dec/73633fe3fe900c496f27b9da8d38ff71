Tahane said one sangoma gave her muthi to apply to her ear but after she applied it, she heard a loud bang and smelly water started running out of the ear.“A few days later, I started getting itchy burn wounds all over my face,” she said. Tahane said all the prophets and sangomas agreed the trouble started with the phone call. She appealed to anyone who could help her heal to contact Daily Sun’s Limpopo offices on 065 892 4670. Medical Doctor Mabuwa Makhomisane said it sounded like Tahane was suffering from a fungal infection, a bacterial infection or a reaction to something she had eaten or applied to her face. The doctor said she would need to have a proper medical examination to rule out diseases like diabetes and to get to the bottom of the problem.
