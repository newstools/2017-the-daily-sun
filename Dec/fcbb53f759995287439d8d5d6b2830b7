    Alcohol and drug testing forms part of the health and safety policies and procedures in many industries. Industries that have particularly strict and controlled safety standards, such as chemical manufacturers, mining and construction are especially strict when it comes to testing for alcohol. But many companies do not use the same cautionary practices. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstsPzK_WPKmNrHeKrghbdQuyYMdlC9RJa7jOl36r3-z5pP4Q-RKMpPrNev5T1DBq-2DW3Mzcj8Fns2vzoE4pvhz1VlhW3AacNYmy_rv2m9I12mzvAezQtTBZmKSryU928TLwXh-U0v_qMiWBYXBPDUkeQfGvQkRmHAgvOokIhN-mcZNi2JnCsHhIRLuqKp1CcknYMokCdv0_Ph-CacprT3B5WiJPx5D-Ig-6EalIG17Uag9kokoQKhLYGSJmaqKTfdMH_wm8et6gESFlTWAb_61YsFh82g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHaEq32ftxuzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Some companies may choose to allow alcohol under certain conditions, such as at a work function, but it should still make sure that the legal driving limit for alcohol is maintained if staff are required to drive home afterwards.
