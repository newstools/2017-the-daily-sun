And that changed her life. It encouraged her to help in the fight against the dreaded disease. Anna told Daily Sun: “At the time when I was diagnosed, people would not eat with you, touch you, or shake your hand. “It was hard on HIV-positive people.” She said counselling helped her to deal with her situation and she decided to lead a healthy lifestyle. She disclosed after her husband died in 2013. “I decided to make it my mission to educate people about the disease,” she said. She invited her neighbours and told them about her disease. “I also volunteered at local clinics to counsel newly diagnosed people,” she said. Anna is well known for distributing condoms. “I work as an HIV/Aids counsellor for the City of Tshwane,” she said. “Although I’m paid in kind the opportunity has helped me reach out to many people.” A lot of young people were dismissive of her message. She told them to go to school and forget about getting rich overnight. “Blessers and sugar daddies won’t make you rich. They’ll make you sick,” she said. “It is a crime to infect someone when you know your status. That is why people should get tested and know their status.”
