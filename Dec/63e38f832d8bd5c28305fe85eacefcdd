Even more worrying for the Madrid boss is that star man Cristiano Ronaldo has missed the first two group training sessions of the week with a calf complaint.As for Barcelona, they have yet to taste defeat in the league so far this season and will be looking for a repeat of their dramatic 3-2 win over Real when they last met at the Santiago Bernabéu in La Liga. In terms of injuries Valverde will be without long-term absentees Ousmane Dembélé and Samuel Umtiti, and to date has no fresh injury concerns heading into the match.Real Madrid has not kept a clean sheet against Barca in the league since October 2006 and will need a captain’s performance from Sergio Ramos is Madrid are to pick up their first home Clasico win since October 2014. Ramos has called the match on Saturday a must-win for his side, and the central defender will have to step up if Real Madrid is to deny Messi and company.Summer signing Paulinho could have a decisive impact in the tie from the heart of midfield. The Brazilian grabbed a brace in the 4-0 win over Deportivo over the weekend and could have a say on Saturday evening at the Bernabeu. Paulinho has scored six times this season, making him the highest scoring midfielder in the squad. Many people doubted the former Guangzhou Evergrande player following his move in the summer, and a goal on Saturday would be the perfect tonic for the player’s detractors.
