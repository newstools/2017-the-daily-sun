    THE excitement with which the Kaizer Chiefs fans greeted news of Leonardo Castro's imminent arrival seemed to smack of desperation.And if the recent history of transfers is anything to go, Castro may not really be the "messiah" mostly frustrated Amakhosi fans are hoping for, seeing as their team continue to underachieve.“Chiefs and Sundowns have finalised the agreement and Castro will join Chiefs in January,” the club announced in a terse statement.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuqGt3oiYGY_SYls6yjvKsycrTzXCRjTvWjUErqPiNJ4zIyWQF_f8BuHNgJFmcSWqO3wCTw3uSYg_MR8OTG9ariE1jz7gWvBrv_yNGpHTJiZIteB0s-Cq4mUkQW897ODE2NACVEDN5BR-czDjzYEmnw7PTJ9o42pEvcWpyrAn7_P6cWnUUcyEENgIDjboA4RcJAQz4eSY_2ImzHU6XVoC0VoMVIH72FN7rkv_3UZa9C-CP9iv9T2MMg6k16TJy5A6toTbTQEUvEDsF_0op7\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCACKLwONxCjEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
