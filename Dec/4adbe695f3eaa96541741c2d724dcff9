    EVERYONE in the music industry knew Kevin Ntaopane was Mandoza’s manager and the CEO of Kevin Riss Inc. However, since the kwaito star died of cancer last year, the 41-year-old from Freedom Park, Joburg has been keeping a low profile. This week he broke his silence, saying he was devastated after Mandoza’s death and struggled to deal with the loss. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsveUNpwuKi3INkeHlW3Iv0Y_Ztx8uy4vcu7J1BNeOj7ISPsxJMkrFTxvUHggzpRNO_ACuUA_7oekfz3XeBQ4ybXE-FI7GvvDGw6hlQuwloQbZN8Ss6CQKwEjNyYqZx3E2u49Ykil_wjehGhnK-Ab0tVD_qkuA2fMN1ZCRmTlNkt8PYiUIWFl4G6SRO1h2vTRo9wGzg_Z3DwZo2qIs7EKfwUBvYiS0Ifc_aL2wRQg54JNjEv2c_bRaWN1andikd3TWV_--SF7HU2IGNsU6iG9t03WDxL0YI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJOMHx6yfwgUEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I was hit by a double blow.” Kevin is planning to release an EP called My Journey in which he will share his feelings. He said it took him more than a year to get over the loss of his mum and Mandoza. “The pain is not yet over but one can’t live in the past. “I owe it to Mandoza and my mum to live for the future. I am dedicating this album to them.” Speaking about launching his own music career after spending years managing other artists, he said the first single from the EP, Why Now, was released at the beginning of the month. Kevin said he stayed out of the public eye after Mandoza died because people were saying bad things about him. “I had anxiety attacks because I was attacked by people. I wondered why it was happening, which is why the song is called Why Now. “The name of the album, My Journey, refers to all the things I went through.” Kevin still manages artists like Vicky Vilakazi, Mshoza, Bravocious and Jakarumba.
