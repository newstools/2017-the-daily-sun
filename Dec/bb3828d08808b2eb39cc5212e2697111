rose on a point of order and said just before the House adjourned he had seen
Dirks attempt to strike one of the female members sitting next to him."For the safety of the members there and for the
decorum of the House, I really think that he should be removed from the House
in terms of rule 70 so that we can continue the business," Steenhuisen
said.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu then said "serious
allegations have been made against a member of this House, by members in that
corner", pointing in Dirks' direction.
