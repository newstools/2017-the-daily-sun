We won’t be going anywhere until we are given those houses.”City of Ekurhuleni PR councillor Lizah Phoko said: “These are special people who are supposed to be given preference but that is not happening.“They have been in the rain now for two days without food. Officials must address their needs and make sure they get what they want.”She said some of the elderly needed to go back to their homes to take medication.
