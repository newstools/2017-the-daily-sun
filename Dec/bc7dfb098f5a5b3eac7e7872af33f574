All I wanted was to touch many lives. Today I can say I am reaping the rewards of my efforts.“Some of the kids who were here when we started are now in grade nine, which is a blessing for me.” Dikeledi told mums to be their kids’ directors. “Look after your kids and make sure you lead a worthy life.”
