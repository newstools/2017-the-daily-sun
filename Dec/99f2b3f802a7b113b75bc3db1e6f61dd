Lower Sabie region. “A pride of lions
suddenly appeared out of the bushes and started walking on the road.  “Two of the lions
then went into the bush and started chasing a buck towards the remaining lions
on the road.“The buck leaped and bounced across the road straight into
the jaws of the unsuspecting lions,” explained Beeslar.He also added that “This was a quick and easy meal for
them”.“It was amazing to see how quickly they tore the buck apart
and just devoured it."WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
