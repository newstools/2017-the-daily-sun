    FAILURE of Jomo Cosmos to qualify for the Nedbank Cup last-32 could be a blessing in disguise as they will have more time to focus on the league title.Ezenkosi failed to secure a last-32 spot when they were defeated 3-1 by National First Division (NFD) strugglers Ubuntu Cape Town FC on penalties after playing a 1-1 draw in regular time midweek.But Cosmos attacking midfielder Tebogo Tlolane says missing out on the cup competition doesn’t mean the end of the season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssCxict1jxZtHtql-bCGAY0HP8H-vsiaP3NSvol6aIiqHTNUm7s15CL2XNBL8h4wy6bUUHUd798hTN9pvnwoZ7PGsfpRRHvC-lTpt8l95uVKtjBL9RctmjhaaB4_wssZ3LapLwwLsHxxbEVLVX91StIZFSU0Eo5NP3y2daxR1GMJrAsEXZ45kXvfyRPK52a6vz_gUuuZhbLSMQ5Aq_884H-yMRHuI0AmShiBv-IYhzs7DhRk_iVTFIMzQdCiuZSiaor2Pg9IxTTA55OVe2Y-JzNQQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGFX5aU_SOnWEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They are high on motivation so we’ll need to bring our A game,” said Tlolane.Cosmos and Highlands Park are the only teams that went to the final first round matches, having scored more than 20 goals each team after 14 league matches.Like this story?
