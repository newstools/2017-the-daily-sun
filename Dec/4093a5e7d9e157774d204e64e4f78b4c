    If the ANC conference fails to ''unite'' the two factions
we can expect chaos in the country.The ruling party's internal politics, whether good or
bad, will always have a huge impact in the country. Going into the conference, salvos are being fired between
the two factions.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstGIy0XlRHYwWl3i9xqVbTEJEcjq2b-dpWye-n17GEHai6gBrG6eDcSYz-iDRf5m0LeBuGbDWQ336sLUr2qbU7nWjLQqKPWYXFFJzk1t9yHM0qQdu-__j0y8JX0xA5V_7EnqgTSx-3cr-GL-4H4Xoh57f8tkg3aPh3WkRwftN4QoGhVbBOoGuXW9cQoGJQ1TCkyjoXIqO4bmGdzkV72LpCNNu2NUPF9bNmFtEZ8Yoao-oQ7BQRwa3S-877FdbwbSbZunW5qO3Qrz9AeTtS42rHrtom-bOs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOrxTD4wuatNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

that even those in the ANC are dead worried.Whoever wins between Cyril Ramaphosa and Dr Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma must be unifier of note or all hell will break loose.Though some within the ANC are trying to come up with a
compromise, thus far it is clear that the winner will take all.Ramaphosa has rejected President Jacob Zuma's idea that
the losing candidate deputise while those in the Dlamini-Zuma camp have
dismissed Ramaphosa's 'New Deal' talk as un-ANC. Zuma backers such as Nomvula
Mokonyane have also been quoted saying they don't trust Ramaphosa. So it's
highly unlikely that the two factions will be able to work together considering
the strong exchange of words that have been flying around lately.Let's say Cyril wins and he carries out his threat of
bringing those involved in the state capture to book.It is no secret that the current president, Jacob Zuma,
is alleged to be the main character in the State of Capture report, followed by
the Gupta family and his son Duduzane.Several government ministers and senior government
officials are also implicated.So if Ramaphosa is not making idle threats to end
corruption and recover the "stolen" money, then he will most probably
have to touch these individuals.Add to that the over 700 corruption charges against Zuma
that may be reinstated.Once in power, Cyril and his top six's first move would
be to remove Zuma as president of the country and then deal with him
accordingly. The president is aware of this possibility and I
don't think he's just sitting idle and waiting for the day to come. He must be
making plans of his own.Question is will Zuma and his backers sit back and allow
all this to happen in peace?Only heaven knows, but rest assured that the likes of
uMkhonto Wesizwe Military Veterans leader Kebby Maphatsoe will not take this
lying down.The ANC youth league has also been promising to "fight
fire with fire" to defend president Zuma.Many in the Zuma camp, who also happen to back
Dlamini-Zuma, hold a view that the ANC has been infiltrated by foreign
intelligence forces who have planted "enemy agents" in the liberation
movement in order to destroy it. The fact that they also see Ramaphosa as being
too close to the "enemy" that is white monopoly capital could lead
one not to rule out the possibility that they also  see him as one of
those "planted by enemy agents".Hence they are prepared to break the long time ANC
tradition of a deputy succeeding the president.They don't trust Ramaphosa, either with their own safety
or that of the ANC. They want Dlamini-Zuma, who is seen as the messiah, to
deliver them to the promised land of Radical Economic Transformation.Now if they truly believe all this, then this lot will
probably fight Cyril if he wins.There has also been a reports that the Presidency is
drafting new regulations to deal with any potential state of emergency in the
country.The Rapport newspaper claimed that the South African
National Defence Force has endorsed the proposed regulations.The newspaper said that In terms of these draft
regulations, any security official will have far-reaching powers to act within
his or her own judgement, arrest people, search property or cut communication
channels such as cellphones or the internet.The president is allowed to declare a state of emergency
when war, invasion, revolt, natural disasters or other dangers threaten the
nation's safety.But If the Dlamini-Zuma faction wins, the worst that
could possibly happen is a splinter party that would damage the ANC badly and a
stagnant economy in the country.Cyril and his followers would  either just go under
in the ANC or form their own political party. For Cyril, this will be the most viable option or he can
just kiss goodbye the life of active politics.History suggests that if you take on the Zuma faction and
lose, you will became irrelevant in the ANC. Ask Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema
Motlante. You may also ask the 101 veterans. I don't expect Dlamini-Zuma to take any action against
state capture because she had not said so herself.She seems to have set her eyes on fighting Johan Rupert
and dismantling white monopoly capital.In one of her interviews, she also mentioned that she is
not afraid of business, the markets and investors.Whatever she means by "not afraid" we can just
hope that she is not placing the country on a highway  to a Zimbabwe-like
situation.Some things needs careful calculations when implementing
and besides, our economy is globally connected, it does not exist in a vacuum.A simple economic fact is that you need the world,
investors and business in order to grow the economy. Government alone can never
achieve this.So anyone who makes an enemy with the above can forget
about a flourishing economy unless there is a plan we are not aware of.If business feel that the country's political environment
could cause them to suffer a loss, they will simply withdraw their investments.Then we may as well just get used to graduates looking
for jobs at traffic lights.Let's also keep in mind that South Africa's unemployment
rate came in at 27.7% in the third quarter of 2017, the same as in the previous
two quarters and remaining the highest rate in 13 years.
