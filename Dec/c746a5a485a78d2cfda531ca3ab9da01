Meanwhile, in Cape Town two people drowned in separate incidents and 43 children went missing when Capetonians flocked to the beaches on Boxing Day.City of Cape Town law enforcement inspector Wayne Dyason said 28 children got lost at Muizenberg beach alone.

According to Lambinon, the 34-year-old Athlone man drowned while trying to help his son, who had been swept into the surf between Gordon’s Bay and Koegel Bay.In a separate incident, a 63-year-old man drowned after reportedly diving into the water at an educational camp at Soetwater Resort in Kommetjie.
