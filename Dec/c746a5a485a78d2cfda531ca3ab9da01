I suspect he tried to follow me but got lost. “Luckily, he had a wristband with my contact details on it, so I went to the child minders who helped me find him,” said Jabulile.The eThekwini Municipality reported that more than one million holidaymakers visited the beach between 23 and 25 December.Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said lifeguards worked tirelessly to save lives.“We had organised childminders and 154 lifeguards were working across the beachfront,” said Mthethwa. Chairman of the eThekwini Municipality Festive Season Committee Malcolm Canham said they had beefed up security at the beaches. Meanwhile, in Cape Town two people drowned in separate incidents and 43 children went missing when Capetonians flocked to the beaches on Boxing Day.City of Cape Town law enforcement inspector Wayne Dyason said 28 children got lost at Muizenberg beach alone. But all 43 were reunited with their parents, thanks to the wristband identification system called Identikidz.National Sea Rescue Institute spokesman Craig Lambinon said on Boxing Day they had rescued a boy but could not save his father. According to Lambinon, the 34-year-old Athlone man drowned while trying to help his son, who had been swept into the surf between Gordon’s Bay and Koegel Bay.In a separate incident, a 63-year-old man drowned after reportedly diving into the water at an educational camp at Soetwater Resort in Kommetjie. Lambinon said the man was already dead when they arrived at the scene.
