According to Lambinon, the 34-year-old Athlone man drowned while trying to help his son, who had been swept into the surf between Gordon’s Bay and Koegel Bay.In a separate incident, a 63-year-old man drowned after reportedly diving into the water at an educational camp at Soetwater Resort in Kommetjie.
