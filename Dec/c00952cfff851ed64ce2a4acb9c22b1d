    MAMELODI Sundowns will be seeking revenge when they host Cape Town City FC in their last Absa Premiership encounter before the Christmas recess. The on-form Brazilians host the Citizens in a catch-up league game at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday night (7.30pm). Downs coach Pitso Mosimane said emotion would play a role as his team heads into the game against the outfit from the Mother City. Benni McCarthy’s charges completed the league double over the Tshwane giants last season. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstsPc8V1lqGB_F4odQCbnFGHrnXf7JIJDWvNnfQ_qvk3x5wdUD8EcGrfHHdIYZU09rnn58lBqva2Xh0aUAgTXMkOweLKWNuqwT_rzCkBuVuROGy_wqyebLAmfbZZGOo7zw7TcURIuCQ8_gAfVWf2C7N6l4Nz5R1cCEi6oxOz-on8JtyTf8Fph1VzlG8LpvLLpYSdlzCkXsOoQeXsswYLneZpU5Ps4aCBYeDZF-rlA0skA59soysy6t-3Z4O0U2oMSvzBu0SnGk_CZli2JLgTaxJ2A\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLqsQCGP5xpoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Stars such as Percy Tau, Tiyani Mabunda and Hlompho Kekana are in good form. Downs top the league table with 28 points from 13 matches. Mosimane watched his side demolish Bloemfontein Celtic with a commanding 4-1 victory at the same venue at the weekend. Tau, Mabunda, Thokozani Seklotlong and Themba Zwane burst Celtic’s bubble in the second half. Said the Downs coach: “City beat us twice last season and we will be emotional – we will personalise this. Platinum Stars beat us most of the time and Celtic too. But that has changed now. We will get it right against City too.” Mosimane says he expects McCarthy to employ an attacking approach in their first duel since the former Bafana Bafana striker took over the reins at the beginning of the season. Mosimane continued: “His players go forward, they play football – they don’t sit back. Benni is a legend, he is doing well so far.” City midfielder Teko Modise will be playing against his former team for the first time since his move to Cape Town at the beginning of the season. Mosimane said he would shake hands with Modise and welcome him to Loftus. “Teko has done nothing bad to me. I only have good memories of him, he is a legend. I never said he must go, he opted to go as he wanted game-time.” Mosimane added that several matters forced the Brazilians to let go of Colombian striker Leonardo Castro, who will join Kaizer Chiefs in the January transfer window. He said: “There were lot of issues but I don’t want to go there. I want to retain the positives of him.”
