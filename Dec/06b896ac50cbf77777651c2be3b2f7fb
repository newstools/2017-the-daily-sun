She said her grandson had gone to play with his friend when the boys were both abducted.“We realised something was wrong when he did not come back home at his usual time. We started searching for him and when we could not find him, we alerted the cops.” According to police, one of the boys managed to escape from the shack they were being kept in. He apparently went to a nearby mall, where his uncle works, and told him about the abduction. Police were informed and went to the place on Friday and managed to rescue the boys.The boy’s gogo said her grandson had been badly beaten when he was found.“He had a swollen face and sjambok marks all over his body. His feet were burned.”She told Daily Sun that the incident had left her grandson traumatised.“He cannot sleep and will just start crying out in the middle of the night that he is burning,” said the gogo.She said she is hoping the perpetrators will face the full might of the law.Recently, Religious and Linguistic Rights Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva recommended that all activities related to initiation schools in Gauteng be suspended until the end of December next year, as most schools were being run by unaccredited people.Evaton police spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa said two suspects, aged 17 and 19, were arrested and the third suspect was on the run. “The 17-year-old suspect has been released into his parents’ custody.”
