    MOETI Radiokana (56) is in trouble.Voices that come from nowhere have taken over his life.And worse – the voices seem to have turned the appliances in his house against him as he constantly gets shocked!Some appliances in his house are facing the wall, while others are covered with cardboard.Moeti told the People’s Paper that he started hearing voices in February. He said he could not recognise the different voices and what they actually wanted.Moeti from Rustenburg in North West said the first time he heard the voices, he thought it was something that would go away. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvEGD5qiRF6qHH1Agtc-0NV8Q5BBRzkQ-y56G6rLEhKDdfYKhYPI_kZXiA3taQicSIADXGFfbbTjTAG2sqfd83LLySGpQo3wAzXhcT_K2SA2c7WrsWoRD6nrtb8bVRCw7BCiqV2Av_c9O6GjD-3dVN1GwK9ieM72E6G1MkfDM1CIs0KFyOXbjNYBw60yKqWDYTrc3o9C21yzW_9W3129sLvkzWwhIQNX74CpeD5N9Z0U0YPoOniFgWIolwpPPt0evo2df_TTqCyQURhaNqCF074DJEF-iI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBsZqvrwUOv-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I couldn’t explain what was happening to me. These voices would warn me not to be around friends and even told me to stay away from my partner,” he said.“These voices have ruined my life. I just want my life back.”Sangoma Thomas Mathebula advised Moeti to seek help quickly.“He must consult a traditional healer. This is something that was deliberately done to him.”
