You only harm yourself.”Felicia said she came home early one day and decided to surprise her partner by hiding behind the couch – but she was the one who got the surprise! Her partner arrived home, speaking to his nyatsi on speaker- phone, so Felicia could hear both sides of the conversation.The mother of two said when the nyatsi asked the partner where Felicia was, he said: “Oh, that one. I don’t know where she is and I don’t care.”She said the things he said about her were very bad.When he had finished talking, she got up. “He was shocked to see me there,” she said. “We had a good life before. We were a great couple. Everyone wanted to be like us.”As she was packing her things, she saw a bottle of spirits and that is when she set herself on fire.She said her partner put out the fire. She sustained first-degree burn wounds. She woke up in hospital two months later.She said even the doctors were amazed that she survived. “I am able to do everything for myself and I am grateful for that,” she said.
