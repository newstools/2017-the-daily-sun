time of being a lecturer at WITS, Sobukwe became the editor of The Africanist news
paper in 1957.Soon after he
became the editor, he started criticising the ANC for allowing itself to be
dominated by 'liberal-left-multi-racialists'.Sobukwe
believed that the future of Mzansi should be in the hands of Black South
Africans.According
to Sahistory.org.za, as a result of his disbelief towards the multi-racial path
the ANC was following, Sobukwe was instrumental in initiating an Africanist
breakaway from the ANC in 1958, which led to the birth of the Pan Africanist
Congress (PAC).In 1959,
the PAC announced that it was planning to start a campaign against the pass
laws with the aim to free South Africa by 1963.Sobukwe,
wrote a letter to cops stating that the PAC would be holding a five-day,
non-violent, disciplined, and sustained protest campaign against pass laws,
starting on 21 March.On the day
of the march, protestors including Sobukwe, were arrested and charged with treason.During the
march, a group of 5000 marchers reached the Sharpeville police station and the
police opened fire killing 69 people and injuring 180 others in what became
known as the Sharpeville Massacre.Afterward,
he was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for inciting Africans to
demand the repeal of the pass laws.At the end
of his three-year sentence on 3 May 1963, the then National Party endorsed a
General Law Amendment Act, which was termed the 'Sobukwe Clause'.The Sokuwe
Clause empowered the Minister of Justice to prolong the detention of any political
prisoners indefinitely, with this clause Sobukwe's prison sentence was renewed
every year when it was due to expire.
