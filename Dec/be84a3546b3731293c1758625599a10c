    THE vultures in the PSL continue to circle around SuperSport United camp eager to pounce on Jeremy Brockie.The latest to join the list of suitors is Orlando Pirates, who are battling with Mamelodi Sundowns for the Kiwi striker.Even though he has gone off the boil in recent months, Brockie remains the much sought-after forward in the Premiership where prolific strikers are as hard to find as needles in a haystack.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsttAw_NiAqt2Z7HAY_GBc2zfFoMfmH5uoSi4Is3wnS29YWWbCxT1JsYvnegxI8W6C409VdHhEQEZV_yDUh8Bb_Smhn0qRdeJkblglfiSqGm8m7g4H6ufzw8ty4nE7QgxnbNnvJkxNp0mzFbG3_WKc8u7L67BhVYVZoFak0yOU6Z648dD4eqmXG0J1wnP7DR-NfzIRO6QjbR4VvYYfkdx8KKZCzcJq00dc6UiDPQyCDO2HwXYm0EKKdBvgo1P5nTELaOK0HI-ct5U4TD8QS4R9JBnw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ0MTsQlnT7dEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Elsewhere, there has hardly been time to rest for the clubs bosses this festive, amid growing pressure on teams to start collecting maximum points.Cape Town City are eyeing bench warming Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Keagan Buchanan as well as frustrated Ajax Cape Town midfielder Travis Graham.Buchanan, who also tops the shopping list of Maritzburg United could be amenable to a loan move back home in Cape Town where he last played for FC Cape Town four seasons ago.He has barely featured for Amakhosi this season, being limited to a mere three appearances through injury and form.It’ll be hard for him to nail down a regular first team spot ahead of George Maluleka and Hendrick Ekstein, who’ve been Steve Komphela’s preferred duo this season.Then there is Wiseman Meyiwa, the youngster who has taken to his senior professional career like a duck to water.But it’s the uncertainty over the future of Graham at Ajax which could see the former skipper switches to their city rivals. Graham hasn’t played for the Urban Warriors so far and remains in limbo.His troubles are understood to have triggered by his request for transfer at the off-season, leading to his exile from his childhood club.He has been training with the Under 19 side, yet it may not be for long as the Citizens are said to be keen in him.
