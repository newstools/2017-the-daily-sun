He said South Africa and Zimbabwe enjoy a good relationship underpinned by strong historical and political bonds that date back from the liberation struggles of both countries. “The significance of this diplomatic relationship is marked by the annual convening of the Bi-National Commission signed in 2015 and co-chaired by the two heads of state.” He said the two countries had also signed over 40 memoranda of understanding and agreement covering issues such as security, energy, agriculture, mining, trade, transport and arts and culture. “Trade between the two countries has seen growth over the year, with Zimbabwe being one of South Africa’s top five trading partners in the region and on the continent. “South African exports to Zimbabwe last year were worth R29,3 billion,” Ngqulunga said. Mnangagwa also addressed a high profile business conference in Tshwane.
