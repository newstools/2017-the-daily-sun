Paseka went home thinking everything was fine. But when he arrived at Mgababa squatter camp near Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, he spotted the worker in a vehicle that had three occupants in it.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuhNJQrV3M3B_pEzjZYkMiDuW8-Sop8MblCfxW0v34adnmYC0FAjRmMEao9ACYjlOg1sFLoMh442XKj_7Gv74HUCFySXU9JQVvwuAmgFH_jnJxxC-5swFXeFfRWb1Hzx7BPI7Z21dxSSKxae-vjyfRm9cMMaU8BL5XepqqCa6aWIn6rWS6DhF8TUwyv6RO0E7_fB1h2QQu9rvRPsAF6_O9r6MdqdKlAgcsuoqZ40rbOZmTizcWrhAfzo2efagkLvBmlHguoD2dL4ZgQ8KeFzu5G5BukM40\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzA9dxoA6mmGEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A gun fell from his pants, and when he picked up the weapon I knew I was in trouble and ran away.”The car followed his car at high speed. “I floored the accelerator, and that is when they started shooting at me,” he said. “They fired several shots but all of them missed, except for one. The bullet hit the rear window.” He raced to nearby Putfontein cop shop. He believes he was saved by the car’s shatterproof windows.“If the windows weren’t that strong, I would’ve been dead,” he said.Putfontein police spokesman Constable Justice Ramaube confirmed that a case of attempted murder was opened.“Police are on the hunt for the suspects,” said Ramaube.
