match in Durban because there are no stadiums available in Cape Town.The Cape Town Stadium will be hosting the World Rugby Sevens
event this weekend.However, city councillor Stuart Diamond has hit back at
Comitis and McCarthy after the story of City’s plight was published in Daily
Sun last Friday.In a statement to Daily Sun, Diamond said: “I am quite
flabbergasted by this about-turn by Cape Town City FC, which comes on the back
of a CT City article two weeks ago thanking and commending city officials and
me personally for our support and willingness to go the extra mile. “This about-turn is dishonest, as it does not reflect the
facts.“While it is regrettable that Cape Town cannot, through sheer
demand, host every premier sporting event at the Cape Town Stadium and we note
CT City’s concerns, we feel bound to point out that the match in question was
always scheduled to be played at Athlone Stadium. “Cape Town City were aware of this and were informed well in
advance that the Cape Town Stadium wasn’t available.”Due to the severe drought in the Western Cape, the Athlone
Stadium has become unplayable due to the grass dying from overuse.Added Diamond: “CT City subsequently asked if we would
engage with Saru (SA Rugby Union) to ask them to make an exception regarding
Cape Town Stadium and, in addition, enquire on the availability of Newlands
Stadium. We did and the answer was negative on both fronts. “Newlands has already started its remedial work and is not
playable.“CT City then requested that we assist them with a letter to
the PSL asking for the game to be played away. We obliged and did not turn them
away.“CT City must be honest with supporters and not unfairly
attack the City, which remains committed to working with all sports clubs.” ) As a result of this, Ajax Cape Town are also forced to
play their home match against Chippa United away at Milpark Stadium in Joburg
on Saturday (8.15pm).
