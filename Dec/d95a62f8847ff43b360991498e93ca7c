Conty was inspired by his father who told him about engineering.He said: “My father put the fire in me to become passionate about cars. I love Ford.”After matric, Conty couldn’t further his studies because of financial difficulties so he continued to build wire cars to make a living, hoping to one day become a car designer for a top company. He said it wasn’t easy to build the car.“The car fought back. It kept telling me I couldn’t build it. But I said I’ll build it because I love it. That’s how it worked out,” he said.Creative Rides in Bryanston, Joburg, a dealership specialising in classic cars, gave Conty the space to work on his car. The replica is now on display at the dealership.Spokesman Bryce Roberts told Daily Sun building the car was a long process that required a lot of materials and equipment.“Conty did an impressive job all by himself. We offered him the space because we believed in his capabilities from his previous efforts at building wire cars.” Bryce said the car would be sold if they received a reasonable offer.
