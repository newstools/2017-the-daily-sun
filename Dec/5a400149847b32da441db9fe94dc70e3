I went out to go look. I thought maybe people were in trouble and wanted to help,” said Mabe.Mabe said when he went down the stairs, he was greeted by hail of bullets.“One missed my head by an inch. That’s when I went down and crawled back to my room and locked myself in,” he said.Mabe said guards were fighting off the five armed men.“It's only when cops came through that I went down,” he said.Mabe said only 3 rooms were occupied in the hotel and the gunmen knew that.“All I can say I can't rule out the possibility of an attempted political assassination as we are heading to Nasrec for the conference,” he said.“I have never been this scared in my entire life,” he said.A security guard was injured and taken to hospital with bullet wounds.Case was opened by the cops.
