    Eastern Cape government
officials wasted funds allocated for the provision of running water,
electricity, sanitation, ablution facilities and the replacement of
mud-schools, under the cover of late
president Nelson Mandela's funeral in 2013.This was the opinion of Public
Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who delivered her report on the misappropriation
of funds amounting to at least R300m from the Eastern Cape government, on
Monday.The monies were channelled to the
Eastern Cape Development Corporation, which is the implementing agent of
provincial treasury.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4qHEelJ_Jm5cIbmvZofrj9L6hK19KbXy82TJgJwIMe2wTpqAKcIFoI_xspWxzm8RUkXRPH6JVI1uWEnb78USPaLvwWdRG7AIXl4PupDEPC8ZGjJDJUF52cCEFbEpkoxiIdtpB8xTRfPWmV11x8fzYeyi1Jr93a-Ylk1xoEt1wjE3GICwh-8iObL6G9PKMkxKDMY2czvbyJIcNeI_ykNp5zw3mbZcxC2n1U5e5MvV8GounORm7kZ5dEXR9ykV1Q3HOTdJgaJNUbA1YWdf1jjrzWB7rB-k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJYD2Dvpoh-VEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

found damning evidence to suggest that procurement processes followed in the
appointment of service providers for the funeral were not in accordance with a
system that was fair, equitable, transparent, cost-effective and competitive.Provincial treasury head Marion
Mbina-Mthembu, has been pinpointed as the source of the impropriety. In the
report, Mbina-Mthembu was said to have unlawfully misdirected funds allocated
to provincial exco."The conduct of Mbina-Mthembu
in approving and authorising procurement of goods and services relating to the
funeral was in violation of the provisions of section 217 of the
Constitution... Her conduct was improper and constituted
maladministration."Mkhwebane also found that the
Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency incurred irregular expenditure of R500
000 and fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R970 000.Buffalo City Municipality
improperly procured the services of, and paid, service provider Victory Tickets
750 CC almost R6m in public funds to transport mourners to four venues for the
memorial service observation.The King Sabata Dalindyebo
Municipality incurred unauthorised expenditure in excess of R4.2m and fruitless
and wasteful expenditure of R1.4m, she added.Â "There is an indication that payment
of goods and services to certain suppliers was based on procurement
documentation, the context of which was incorrect or that did not refer to the
items that were ordered."Nelson Mandela Bay Metro incurred
unauthorised expenditure of R110 300 in catering with OR Tambo District
Municipality, incurring R443 500.Mkhwebane has recommended that
Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba ask President Jacob Zuma to issue a proclamation
to have a special investigations unit and a special tribunal to investigate unlawful
appropriation and expenditure of public money, she said.
