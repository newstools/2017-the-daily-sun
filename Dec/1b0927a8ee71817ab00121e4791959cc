years, but the SCA took into account the time he had already served.The State had applied to have Pistorius's initial
six-year prison sentence increased.The world-renowned athlete was arrested on Valentine’s
Day in 2013 – the day of the killing.He fired four shots through a bathroom door, claiming
that he believed there was an intruder in the bathroom.North Gauteng High Court Judge Thokozile Masipa initially
sentenced Pistorius to five years for culpable homicide in 2014.Pistorius served only 10 months of the five-year sentence
in prison before being released and put under house arrest.The State appealed the culpable homicide conviction, and
it was later replaced with murder by the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2016.The State petitioned the SCA directly, arguing that the
six-year sentence was far too lenient.More to follow.
