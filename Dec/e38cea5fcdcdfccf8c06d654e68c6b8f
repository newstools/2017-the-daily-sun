    PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma’s unexpected announcement regarding free education received mixed reactions from opposition parties.Zuma said the government would now subsidise higher education for poor and working class students.While the EFF welcomed it as a victory for the poor, the DA slammed it as dangerous tactic. Both parties asked where the money for this policy would come from.Zuma made the announcement on Saturday during the ruling party’s elective conference.EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi welcomed the announcement as a “historic victory”.DA MP Belinda Bozzoli said the president delayed the announcement until the end of the year so he could make a splash at the ANC conference.“Unsurprisingly, his statement is full of promises but lacks actual implementation details,” she said.Zuma said the definition of poor and working class refers to those currently enrolled in TVET colleges or university students from South African households with a combined annual income of up to R350 000.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-rUekDCxBCz2O7_ogNBpQDukEbKjiVcm26qHA0imNjgtZ57oLtwmsS91oeBSck2HabWci5Fm7g2oLtihNk0BK_GM57TBPKJnRCOQ7KRSvlB-68P4CsW1fTmi2gGiQdod-9rrCt6CADKsXEcdUdTrdSa9U_F64NMnL2P86jPlksG7o_ETLyt7GMaqsg3g9RkKtA5RYZ_YJN6hMT1dczqCE22gaFQABzcaJf35vP7djBjK-nWAU3Smp_KcIz41tTdIjV4Y5upWj5cqdvBF-G3uXqs96wNw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzD4aspdsjvIxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
