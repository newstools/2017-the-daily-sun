    THE founder of a chain of beauty clinics was described as
a “money grabbing individual” by a judge as he was sentenced for the death of a
client last week.According to Coconuts,
Stephen Chow Heung-wing (63) was found guilty of manslaughter earlier this
month in Hong Kong. This was after Chan Yuen-lam (46) died in 2012 after
undergoing a treatment she was told would boost her immunity. The procedure
involved her blood being drained out of her, processed and then injected back
into her body.The procedure cost $7 600 (about R97 000).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstbquVuSVtNyuObq2XPfcMnBgcuEWS6gWPYQ2vDYFOgOK0krJ1SlyCgXHndhqFD1l2LLmbVynfU55Q-M88PfbX9uYeW5h2rk9U463VF4KtOa0ptzpjr7RNS6bxAInv-5UtGfDiMPcEyDhONRiZOmuunpBPChHgEqXHmAAXVNQYYPjU-KpSIufyDSqOQkHRR530TI0UxenKJhU-xuKhaWCv-nn2l2toLxeR_-NgAgo6QUM1Wy7XsXVvFqLChUSDEuQlb3hJyzliVcdGsZvG5fIB-5vaa0JfhmAEBEg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPhZ3SuIUv4gEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

infected with bacteria. She died of septic shock and multiple organ failure a
week later, said the report.Two other clients who were given the same treatment were
left fighting for their lives, one needing several parts of her body cut off to
stay alive.Heung-wing, who founded the beauty clinic chain DR Group in
Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, was last week sentenced to 12 years, while his
technician, Chan Kwun-chung (32) got a 10-year jail termJudge Judianna Barnes described Heung-wing as a “money
grabbing individual” who showed no signs of being sorry for his terrible
mistakes.Coconuts reports that Hong Kong’s beauty treatment
industry is largely unregulated, resulting in “questionable and dangerous practices that require urgent
attention.”
