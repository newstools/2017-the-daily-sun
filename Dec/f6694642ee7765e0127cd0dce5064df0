We have the title deed to prove it, but she claims the house belongs to her because she was married to our father after our mother died.”Olga claimed after their father died in 2014, their stepmum made a fake will, claiming their father left the house to her. “My father’s signature on her so called will is fake and the lawyers she used were also fake.”Olga said they went to the Law Society and found her stepmum’s lawyers were not even registered with the society.The SunTeam went with the three siblings to the house and found a padlock on the gate. In the yard was a car belonging to a neighbour. Stepmother Nobuhle Kheletsane said the house belonged to her husband and denied faking his will.Mashoeshoe Attorneys advised the family to get a lawyer to look into the matter.
