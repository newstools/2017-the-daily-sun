The Durban High Court last year declared Vela the legitimate leader of the church, but Mduduzi appealed. Saturday’s announcement came as a relief to church members, as many had started suspecting something was wrong after the introduction of the new leader was postponed twice. Many people expected him to be revealed on the day of Vela’s funeral, but they were told to wait as the lawyers had been instructed to give the family two weeks to mourn before naming the new leaders. Church members expected the name to be revealed last Saturday, but the announcement was postponed again and no reason was given. As with all previous leaders of the church, the new leader has been given a title, and he will be addressed as Inkanyeziyokusa, which means morning star. He is a lawyer by profession and has a law firm in Durban.Church secretary Chancy Sibisi said members welcomed their new leader and would respect him.
