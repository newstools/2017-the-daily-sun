The sinkhole looked bad but caused no accident or damage to vehicles,” saidHerbst. “For their safety, motorists were told to take alternative routes to get to their destinations.”He said in Stanger the roads were flooded but no one was injured, nor were any accidents reported.South African Weather Service forecaster Julius Mahlangu said people in KZN should not expect more heavy rain.“No heavy rains are expected anytime soon, except for light rainfall especially on the south and north coast today,” said Mahlangu.
