She died at the scene,” said Mbi. He said the suspects, aged between 16 and 20, will appear in the Mdantsane Magistrates Court today in connection with the murder. Meanwhile, an eight-year-old boy drowned after he went swimming with his friends in the Kei River on Saturday. Police spokeswoman Captain Siphokazi Mawisa said the little boy was from Keilands, Bholo. His friends had run to the village to inform their parents after he had disappeared under the muddy water. “Community members went to look for him, and when they could not find him they phoned the police at about 5:30pm,” said Mawisa. She said police divers were called to the scene and his body was found on Sunday. “An inquest docket has been opened for investigation,” said Mawisa.
