They have occupied our land without giving us a cent,” she said. Elizabeth’s son Tebogo Mahomotsa said his father died fighting to get his land back. “The municipality is aware of this but they just don’t want to compensate us.” According to residents, there are other families in the area whose land was also taken by the municipality without compensation.“Evaton Police Station was extended on someone’s stand. The owner complained and the police station is now standing idle because the issue is not resolved,” claimed one resident.Emfuleni spokesman Stanley Gaba said they were investigating the claims.
