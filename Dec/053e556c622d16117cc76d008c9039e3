Ten years ago, the Constitutional Court ruled that the demarcation of KZN’s boundaries was invalid because due process hadn’t been followed and there had been insufficient public participation.Now stakeholders have been told there is a proposed amendment and people are urged to submit their views. Public hearings are expected until 28 February next year.African Independent Congress leader Mandla Galo welcomed the process, saying it was a step towards positive change. ANC regional member Polelo Mohale said he supported the move.But Reverend Whyte Mahlasela differed, saying the new process would continue to cause uncertainty and would have a negative impact on service delivery. Galo said meetings about the proposed amendment of the Constitution were part of an effort to ensure that Matatiele goes back to KZN.
