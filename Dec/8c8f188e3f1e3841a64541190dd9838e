Chief Buyisile Ntleko said such cases are very common in the area. He said he had been to Centane Home Affairs numerous times but the officials have not been able to fix problems. He said: “We have lost hope in the Centane branch because the people who go there end up suffering and getting sick.“We ask government to intervene and save gogos from this nightmare before they die.”Home Affairs official Buzani Fezile said some people change their date of birth so they can benefit from job opportunities reserved for the youth.He said a Home Affairs’ assessment committee would look into the matter and take a decision.Addressing more than 500 community members at the Sassa outreach programme in Centane on Friday, Fezile said the department had called on people to come forward between 1997 and 2007 to have such mistakes rectified. However, he said these cases can be rectified only if the victim came with witnesses and an affidavit written by a local chief.
