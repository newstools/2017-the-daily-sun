He has predicted a landslide victory for the ANC in the 2019 election.“Not only will we win the election, but we will reclaim all the metros we had lost,” he said. Malo A Botsheba, as Stephen is fondly referred to, told Daily Sun he has prayed and called for unity in the party.“We want our newly elected leaders to be respected so that they can work hard towards achieving great things for the party and country. I’m a dedicated member of the ANC and very happy about the outcome of the conference,” he said.The Limpopo-based singer said many political activists and ordinary residents sacrificed their lives for Mzansi’s democracy, and the ANC has a duty to protect the gains of freedom.He expressed his happiness with the newly elected top six and said it was balanced.Malo said he is working on a new album, called Unity, which will be released in March. He said he was recovering from injuries he sustained during a beating in Polokwane two weeks ago where he lost two teeth, broke a leg and sustained injuries to his hands.
