    WHAT was meant to be a dream holiday for an Australian
woman celebrating her 30th birthday turned into a nightmare after an
accident resulted in her leg being cut off.According to Coconuts,
Stacey Liddle from Brisbane was riding a motorbike she’d rented in the southern
Thai town of Phuket on 26 October. A passing tour bus smashed into her,
knocking her to the road. The bus then drove over her leg, crushing it.Stacey was rushed to Vachira Hospital where several
operations were performed to try and fix the severely broken leg. At this stage
doctors were hopeful that they had done enough and Stacey’s leg would heal.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv4wf7_CQ-0DKLJj0RgVmYdscGOJM959LxsBgoj_Dn4oI39-40zzb0z2kOF4xLJrHLlpF4c_HswyZwL1te3b0TbS7wY5eNELAMnCaEfIpBRXSPx9YmcX_hrBMjicg1mkLmOPwM5wEZEJ35VjNteTDmn2Fd5cPl4-8e3U2AehkzpZ7lVCI8hlJ8_cCErSJ5uxVYa7s0KbKiOE7nl6zbUZV6aRJkdtt2Dbqaa7rBRm4i127vY3p86Fd1-d9HVwYXu1cVm2-cBJaimRy9OfQiKFz-xO15STXciTRwvhQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEAIuvKiGDdPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

After three weeks in the Thai hospital,
Stacey became infected with a superbug.A superbug is a strain of bacteria that has become
resistant to antibiotics, making it extremely life threatening. Fearing the
worst, Stacey was flown to Sydney in Australia in a special plane.Surgeons at Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital had no
choice but to cut off her leg from the thigh down to save her life.But Stacey is amazingly upbeat about her situation.
According to the report, she said: “I have no regrets in the decision I made to
have it amputated. I felt quite unwell before the surgery. I got a superbug.“I am so grateful to be alive actually. I can see good
things coming out of this.“I want to use my incident and hopefully help others,
perhaps finish my counselling course and become a trauma counsellor.” Doctors are optimistic that the determined young woman
will be walking with the help of a false leg by June.
