Madala Solomon and gogo Lenah, from Ikageleng kasi in Boshof, had lost hope of ever having a party. The couple share a birthday on 2 December and always hoped to one day have a joint party.Solomon said he met his wife on a farm a long time ago. “We were always thinking of our children and putting them first. “I’m so happy that they have finally made this party a reality,” he said. Lenah said Saturday’s surprise party was a beautiful gesture. “I am so happy because I was even given my favourite traditional attire. “Thanks to my family for making this day possible. “I will cherish it for the rest of my life. “I always tell my children that to have a healthy marriage you have to go down on your knees and pray for your partner. “I am a very happy woman and I’m glad my friends attended our celebration.” One of the couple’s daughters, Dorah Kgwerere (42), said the family joined hands to show their parents love. “We wanted to show them that we appreciate what they have done for us and our children. “We love them. That’s why we went the extra mile to make this day possible,” she said.
