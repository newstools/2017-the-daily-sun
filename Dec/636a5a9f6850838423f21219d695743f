The People’s Paper has helped many people and I believe I will get help.“At one point I visited a sangoma who told me that if she helped me, she would die,” said the troubled man.He said the problem started when he was 18 years old. “I was in the army barracks based in Khayelitsha. The lights in my room would switch on and off at about 2.30am.“I thought it was a ghost and I ended up leaving my job. I studied IT but the torment didn’t stop. “I have sleepless nights. Whenever I sleep I feel something having sex with me and I wet myself. All my relationships fall apart. In the past 10 years I have changed jobs 13 times.”Sangoma Thabisile Zwane said the man needed strong muthi.
