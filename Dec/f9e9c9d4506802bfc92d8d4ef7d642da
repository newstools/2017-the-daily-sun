We’re tired of rebuilding our businesses every year.” “Can you imagine returning from holiday at the beginning of the year and your stall is literally floored?“My kids are still in school. My business ensures I give them all they need.”She thinks thugs burn their stalls when they find nothing to steal.“To be honest, we’re not safe here,” said Xolelwa.“We wish government would build our shisa nyama stalls with brick and zinc on top.“That would save us a lot of stress and the costs we face every year.” City of Cape Town fire and rescue spokesman Theo Layne said such fires are difficult to deal with.“Unfortunately, the fire and rescue service only has a function of extinguishing fires when they occur. “It remains incumbent on the individual property owners to ensure their properties are monitored as best as they can,” said Layne.
