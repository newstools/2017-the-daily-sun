Asked about his plans to ensure that the embattled
state-owned rail operator is placed on the right track, Molepo said that he
would rely on his experience and expertise in the rail sector. Molepo previously
held the position of Prasa's head of rail operations. "I have been in this industry for a number of years, I
understand the operations at Prasa. I am fully aware of what the company's
challenges are and what is needed to get the company back on track so that it
can serve the public," said Molepo. According to earlier media reports, Molepo was suspended by
KwaZulu-Natal's Umgeni Water following indications that he had been involved in
financial misconduct. Molepo told News24 that he was not suspended but instead
chose to resign from Umgeni Water. He added that no charges were ever brought
against him. This is the third time that Prasa has appointed an acting
GCEO since 2016. Molepo was preceded by Lindikaya Zide and Collins Letsoalo.The new Communications Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi
announced on Thursday that Advocate Tintswalo Annah Nana Makhubele was
appointed chairperson, while Dr Natalie Skeepers, Professor John Maluleke and
Magdelene Reddy were appointed board members, she said.NEWS24
