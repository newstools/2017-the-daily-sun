Listening to Selebano is disgusting. The incompetence is shocking and they should both be charged.”Inside the hearing yesterday, former chief justice Dikgang Moseneke lost his patience with the testimony of the suspended head of the Gauteng Health Department, Dr Barney Selebano.Selebano told the arbitration the premier’s office knew they were going to terminate the Life Esidimeni contract. Moseneke warned Selebano that he’d be charged with perjury for constantly contradicting his affidavit.Selebano could not give definite answers on whether he was instructed by the former Health MEC, Qedani Mahlangu, to terminate the Life Esidimeni contract.Selebano’s affidavit stated that he was instructed by Mahlangu but he told the hearing Mahlangu only approved the termination.“There were discussions about the fiscal pressure. We were then asked to find ways and means to deliver the services without compromising the patients but the pressure was still high,” said Selebano.“The premier’s office and the MEC knew about the termination. There was an agreement and I signed it.”Moseneke said: “Let’s stay truthful or you could be charged with perjury. Let’s tell them the truth about how their loved ones died.”It also emerged during the hearing that Selebano’s report to the Health Ombudsman was untruthful about what killed the patients.In his report he suggested the mentally ill patients died in the normal course of providing care.Selebano said some patients died because it was winter, while others suffered from HIV/Aids and were frail. The ombudsman report ruled that out.Legal Aid Advocate Lilla Crouse said: “At the time of compiling this report you already knew what had killed them yet you gave generic information.”Selebano was further challenged about the decision being made based on saving costs.Crouse said: “The Minister of Health, Aaron Motsoaledi, in his parliamentary address on 3 February said the national and provincial departments of health had not run out of money to take care of mentally ill patients. Are you saying the minister was lying?” asked Crouse.He answered: “I don’t agree, but it’s fine.”“But why did you target the most vulnerable group?” Moseneke asked.Moseneke asked Selabano if he thought he should have his job back. “I don’t know. It’s not only about a job but about my family as well,” Seleb
