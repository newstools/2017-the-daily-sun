He said he has been giving gifts to sick kids and newborns at the hospital since 2013.“I feel very humbled to be here today and having a good time with the kids,” Katlego told the People’s Paper. “This is a joyful season and one should think about those who are in hospital, especially the young ones.”He said he spent a few days in hospital when he was younger after he was knocked down by a car, so he understands how the little ones felt. Excited Hopewell Mona (9) said: “I’m very happy to have my favourite soccer star around and I’m grateful for the goodies he gave us.”One of the mums, a smiling Never Dlamini (29), said Katlego made her day and her child’s with his donation.
