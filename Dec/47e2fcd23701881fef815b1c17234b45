sister to her house and checked their bodies for injuries.She found plenty, including scars from being hit with a
belt and a problem with his arm where it had been broken.She was horrified to find blood in the boy’s underwear,
even though it was two months after Hooton had cut his penis.Hooton reportedly told the aunt that he had done this
because the boy’s penis was infected and they had no money for a doctor.When authorities interviewed the boy about it, he said
Hooton had cut his “weewee” and “it doesn’t feel good”.At Hooton’s trial, prosecutor Robbie Crabtree described
the treatment of the little boy as torture. "He was just a beaten boy," he is quoted as
saying.The 28-year-old mother has also been charged with failing
to protect her child from abuse.She is expected to plead guilty in January, the Dallas News said.The boy has since undergone reconstructive surgery and is
living with his aunt.
