    THE ANC's national executive committee (NEC) has shot down a
proposal to separate the voting process for the positions of president and
deputy president.The move was part of President Jacob Zuma’s proposal for the
runner-up of the presidential race to have an opportunity to become deputy
president instead.Secretary general Gwede Mantashe had also said they would
separate the voting to avoid slate voting that has become entrenched in the
party’s elections.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstUppmdEWZMbNjd07QV46duztjwatzxQcXc80Rm-Xdggb8sEoEa3UQmaMF2HLFOxR-RoVi5HJ6UJGNBv1m4yAqsMPPmkT7c93pKSXEOePWHuMWXNtwP5ayMwx_ZpeLob7pEtal8-MWBXXJrDThsX4I0rV8urB_7OWgT0FJsZTZ6r0Y2xr593vrROZJZpDNu2SVEb1axMo4Mu2IARsuUgfo6M8Nw7CkOyQ4oSI5vTbrYdeDNcDoOy_66wfIMKNzFm-_dSknTaev_m12I3VvFwzAQ0esN4cA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOxI0ylB4NyEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
