He sat next to me and immediately started attacking me. Then, suddenly,all of them were beating me up,” he said.   Robert  said they took his phone, bank cards and shoes.   When the gang had finished beating Robert up, they threw him out of the taxi.   “I’m lucky they didn’t kill me. I think it’s be cause I could  speak their language,” he said.   After the ordeal, Robert made his  way to the nearest cop shop.      However, he ended u p leaving  t  he police station  without opening a case because the officers wanted information he didn’t have, like the taxi’s registration number.     Robert warned SunLanders to be extra vigilant this festive season.      Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said Robert needs to go back to the cop shop and speak to the station commander so the officers who didn’t assist him can be questioned.Makhubele said police have not received any more reports of commuters being terrorised from a Quantum.He said: “We advise people to urgently report such incidents to the police.”
