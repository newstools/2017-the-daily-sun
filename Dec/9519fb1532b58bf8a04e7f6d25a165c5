    FRUSTRATION is starting to reign for Benni McCarthy as the pressure increases on the Cape Town City coach.Not so long ago McCarthy received acclaim for the fantastic start to his coaching career as he led City to an early-season cup final. But lately, all he seems to do is moan about referees and slam his players for poor performances as his team gradually drops down the Absa Premiership standings.The Citizens conceded a stoppage time goal on Saturday, Azubuike Egwuekwe cancelling out Aubrey Ngoma’s first-half goal when they played to a 1-1 draw with SuperSport United away.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst4z-VDs1hLY5gxOahVxXO2_F6tcg5ptb-bVTueZWm_tHdjEuzktD3i7AzIunIR_fW40opPYVljTkRvzCLwS19c7L84mUM1nBMbGKJwtLwiQH7iZK90LTta3QkzGYziu85n_cJcBJ_EL9hurzNU8dBzKDgdAiRlxfc3GcvKt3g9dDup6SJEwTox02Unq2kvEoUH-AdGxpIePdZp9hxiKSPGOMXm4bU9wDoa2KhGOMMJDsaEyslNhLmY0NHTZmH1rLsOsdgEMIOTTw63RFOH\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBl_VziQT3rNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We get so many chances and don’t punish the opposition. It happens too often with this team. I’m getting to a point where. . .  I don’t know. “Maybe I don’t speak the proper language or I need to go and learn to speak a language my players could understand, because the simplest, basic things they don’t do right. “We play well, but we let teams off the hook too many times.”City have gone four matches without a win, their last victory coming against Free State Stars early last month.They have picked up only three points out of a possible 12.They may go into the festive break outside the top eight if they don’t win their last two matches of the year – against AmaZulu on Friday and Mamelodi Sundowns next week.Even Eric Tinkler admits his former side let United off the hook. In truth, however, United look like a team in need of a break following the rigours of Caf Confederation Cup football.Said Tinkler: “I don’t think we pitched up for the races. We had one or two chances where we could have scored but apart from that it was all Cape Town City.”SuperSport visit Free State Stars on Wednesday, then Baroka FC on Sunday before they complete the year with a trip to Bloemfontein Celtic next week.
