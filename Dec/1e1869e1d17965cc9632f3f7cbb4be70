I sometimes help my father when he is fixing a car and I learn from him.”She said her father doesn’t want her to be a mechanic because he thinks it’s not a job for a woman, but it is her passion.Another recipient, Refilwe Selepe (17) from Rantsane Secondary School in Phuthaditjhaba, said the scholarship really boosted her matric studies.“Coming from a historically disadvantaged school, I needed funding. The scholarship was very useful to me in finishing matric.“I’m going to study medicine because I believe it is in my power to save people,” she said.The programme was established by the Siyandisa Trust, a black-owned business.
