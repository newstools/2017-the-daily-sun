    WHEN she tested HIV-positive in 2012, the woman accepted her status and told neighbours about it. But now the 29-year-old single mother of one is regretting her decision. She said the neighbours tease and insult her.“They say my punani is HIV-positive. It seems they’re scared I’ll infect them,” the sad woman said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsunGnTMhJUVi5qLfopmuU9wFpy-yUXsca9phVZiZ_iHPvdZgLoUlzjYl9vtwhCm59G2DHxQkQN3x6pTxli-ley6w4TxGkIK02wPsUpVLpZlVTEhpRkYl-RaBi7xoAvUrUBp9n--5EZ9QE487e1GbiHpfP9YbPFQ1DXyk9G8jb8kwpnR0wP-bhiWORjPl3MFk2WbFO_lpBCQF4xQ4bPHYC08tK24ZR9nJzA58SW1E9Bw-dPywRDV50nrWomlU7CYHn_r1V16-40nJJwiSOCYRIS7VMPIDsg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDKdr0TOD0LtEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She told Daily Sun: “At first I encouraged my neighbours to test for HIV so they could know their status as well.“I’m taking ARV treatment so I can live longer. “Still, my neighbours make fun of me in public. Such behaviour chases away any new friends I’m trying to make. I’m a human being and want to be treated like one.” She is afraid her seven-year-old boy will be affected if he overhears the insults.“Two months ago I reported one of my neighbours to the Mahwelereng police after she spoke about my HIV status in front of people at a ceremony.“The police threatened to arrest her, and she begged me for forgiveness. But she keeps on insulting me at stokvels,” the woman said.One of the neighbours admitted to the People’s Paper that she had indeed insulted the woman and teased her about her HIV status.“After she reported me to the police, I asked for forgiveness. For her to say I’m still insulting her is not true,” said the neighbour. Health spokesman Thabiso Teffo said: “It’s wrong to stigmatise HIV-positive people. “The department is proud of this woman who accepted her status and encouraged others to get tested.“People must know that being infected is not a shame. Please don’t make fun of HIV-positive people.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe advised the woman to apply to her nearest magistrates court for a protection order that will stop neighbours insulting her.“If they violate the order, they will be arrested,” said Ngoepe.
