members not to elect leaders were hell-bent on progressing their own lives at
the expense of the masses."We do not want leaders who are obsessed with material things,
while our people don't have a roof over their heads," Mathabatha said."We can't afford to come back from the conference with
leaders who are apologetic about corruption, out of the conference we must
emerge with leadership that will fight this scourge," Mathabatha added.However, the ANC in Gauteng nominated Deputy President Cyril
Ramaphosa, which makes him take the lead in terms of branch nominations ahead
of the National Elective Conference.Although presidential hopeful, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma
received 310 fewer nominations than Ramaphosa, who received a total of 374.The branch nominations tally doesn't necessarily determine
the number of voting delegates in favour of a particular candidate. The 54th ANC Elective
Conference will take place from 16 December at Nasrec in Johannesburg.
