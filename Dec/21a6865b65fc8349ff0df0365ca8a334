"empire" in Mashonaland province by grabbing the "iconic
state-owned Mazowe Dam - almost a century after it was built - and surrounding
tracts of land". The Zimbabwe Independent reported at the time that the
move heightened Grace's "bitter fights with local villagers", who
were now barred from using the huge dam, as she also wanted to privatise it.Mugabe’s growing empire already included a huge
double-storey mansion, a dairy farm, an orphanage and a school.She also planned on building a university.New Zimbabwe.com said that the Mugabes were believed to
own an estimated eight farms in Mazowe alone.  http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/heavily-armed-soldiers-still-deployed-at-grace-mugabes-farm-report-20171212
