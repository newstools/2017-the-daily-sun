I’ve found these people earn little money but yet work very hard. “Stop working for them and start your own business. You should also report Metro cops who abuse you at your stalls but please, make sure you sell at the places you are supposed to be,” Gumede said. Durban CBD vendors’ committee member Xolisile Dlala (40) from J section in Umlazi said the committee will meet next week to discuss the mayor’s comments. She said there were many things she’d hoped to tell the mayor. “Unfortunately, I didn’t get the chance to speak to her. “As vendors we experience a lot of abuse from police and want the mayor to resolve it.” She said they will form groups to clean the city as the mayor had asked them. Nomafolo Pezisa (57) from Lamontville, who sells food at schools, said she attended because she wants to sell in the CBD but didn’t know where to register.“At the imbizo I was told where to register. I will do so in January. “I want to sell second-hand clothes,” said Nomafolo.
