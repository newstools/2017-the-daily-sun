Head of business at Gumtree SA, Claire Cobbledick, said Father Christmas ads receive a lot of attention with an average of 100 views and 20-40 replies.  Cobbledick said Santas have to work long hours in a hot suit for two weeks straight. This includes holidays, and the payment is usually in the range of R250-R500 a day.
