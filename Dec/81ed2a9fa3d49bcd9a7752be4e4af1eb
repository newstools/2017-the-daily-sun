    Dear MizzB I’m a married man who lost his job last year. Things were okay at home till my wife started beating me this year. She beats me whenever she feels I disagree with her.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1419892802&t=artid%3d1235b884-b564-4ef1-8cf1-9b4544a789ec%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1419892802&t=artid%3d1235b884-b564-4ef1-8cf1-9b4544a789ec%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>It is hard because I wasn’t raised to beat a woman but she fills me with shame and anger.  What hurts me is that she does this in front of our children.  Please help me because I am afraid of losing my kids.
