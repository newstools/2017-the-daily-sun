"Mop up operations are underway - all resources have been deployed, and good progress is being made, but it is expected to take a few hours before the entire route can be cleared and re-opened to traffic,"  Roux said.Roux said the N3 Toll Concession (N3TC), which is the company managing the N3 Toll Route between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, strongly advises motorists to either delay their journeys or to make use of the R74 (Oliviershoek Pass) as an alternative route.“Drive with care. Wet weather conditions are being experienced along the route,” says Con Roux, N3TC’s commercial manager.
