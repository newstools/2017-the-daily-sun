THE Vaal River keeps rising as good rains mean its catchment area benefits, but itâ€™s not helping municipalities on its banks.The recent downpours reversed the earlier week-on-week decrease in the 14 dams of the system.But that is little help to struggling municipalities which have fallen behind in payments to water authorities.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvF2Oi7mmc-1O0OZbRUAs5Sm0FtZiEakGN0GywrLzOLKwlaMxsabzTpxb0yYDRGzoILmTU4e2yRQmFe6yAB41uasjl18BSNGM4QIYq3G-1i7EbGpspw8G7JkuGu4dRypVGzKu8gz_OE4XCOjXHXX0uzsOenV14n40C5niNVOiPrG1fPVMU35XwI9eKnol8bKmykjiShyqibZXBLfJlHzZGgRrzCvo8skkyaM5M6K_UFhKxz1o3r-OU4zZ8Egv_KHgJhZqzAAdIJYPgVjhIjysphmZHTYRY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzElSEalorDl0EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
