    TWO cops out on night patrol got the fright of their
lives when a 5 meter long snake blocked their car from moving.According to The
Cairns Post, Sergeant Ben Tome and Acting Senior Constable Chris Kenny were
recently patrolling a rural area of Australia called Wujal Wujal, about 120km
north of Cairns.Suddenly their headlights picked up a giant scrub python
lying across the road.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu4VDQXqp3rZvUSKM14LFSxZp7Liu3sCWcAUcYPWBJN0oBM1JIEmqau4t0MHbnJUgn0TxjqC5yUtdZ_y5PUFbCDVQfiHOgHae-7NHGV1vYPLS9Q2lNnhqB5xnzSlU5RnE2K4dhc07IWKbM7WvONGZ5NEh_sJqfvNz7ENyAi9HDldoJihWVDnw866W0aE6DYdbd24_9PGBaZREqMM5xiIQgy2_jiFyEAF9mCUv1iTHm0sqNLg88dcuWDVL4Rsk7SZXRXVTJLQvFtPM18eBd-S2mWwye2KMecuMdAVQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFrpft6e30XQEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

the python was “good and ready to move.“Not fond of the police attention, the scrub python made
his way quickly off the road so the officers could continue on their way,” said
the report.Scrub pythons are Australia’s largest snakes, growing up
to 8 metres long.They kill prey like mammals and birds by squeezing them
to death.
