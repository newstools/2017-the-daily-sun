after he was arrested last week Thursday after charges of assault leveled against
him.It was
alleged that Ndaba assaulted a 24-year-old woman in her flat in Braamfontein.In a
previous statement, Ndaba had called for the law to take its course on the
matter."In as
much as this has affected me, the craft God blessed me with, my family, friends
and fans negatively; let us please let our SA law handle the matter
rightfully."Ndaba made
headlines after he refused to do any media interviews after the Idols SA
finale, in which 17 year-old Paxton Flielies was announced the winner.
