General Khehla Sitole congratulated the graduates and encouraged them to use their skills and knowledge at police stations across the country. “In improving your policing skills, you will need to apply what you have been taught.” He told them to rank the country’s citizens high. “Use the power given to you with responsibility and be ethical in all that you do. Treat all with respect. “This will keep you on the right track in trying times, even when criminals try to lure you for corrupt gains.” Sitole also told them to work together with residents to fight crime.
