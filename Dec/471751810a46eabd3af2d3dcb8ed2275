    WHEN Alice Dlodlo bought a new house she thought she would finally have peace of mind. However, since she moved in, broom sellers, vegetable hawkers and shop owners have been harassing her for money the previous owner owed. The 63-year-old from Emaphupheni in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she was tired of explaining herself. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsudU986Zq0NeK5ziqsmsYVTwxmR7srjYSQp8FmJZpVjHnLYWdWuDoPtoNM5vg2sYxmjO7icJRWKt0tFztaDsvfLK8N6hXYZrO8zS3LdplfM_U5l6gDiBJg6FzWlibVtNkSiN3RrDIsuUXVA9HCKjSYDn1Y-ZffsQWnCTiPB_Inb8pQYNaSeE5cVoidEeg9DWxrwJBd_BmLx0e_8d7Y6wM0KUFETueRyHJzByk8T0RPzEZSnuWNmIikg6E7Lk6oLVcT_y_v48OUtrBJE0hEjKU8qVTe6Tq0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDIo1aq-f8oVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

These people want their money and they think he still lives here,” she said. “They think I’m related to the previous owner but I don’t know him. People told me the previous owners were crooks. I’m tired of living like this. I saw the house advertised and contacted the seller to buy it four months ago.” The transaction was done through a lawyer. “The previous owner, Nkosi Mahlangu and his wife signed the house over to me after I transferred R150 00 to them. I don’t owe anyone money. I have nothing to do with his debts,” she said. Alice said on Monday night, people came and said they paid R80 00 to Mahlangu and he disappeared with their money. Last year, Daily Sun published a story about Mahlangu allegedly forced a family out of their RDP, claiming it was his. When the SunTeam contacted Mahlangu, he insisted he didn’t owe anyone a thing.
