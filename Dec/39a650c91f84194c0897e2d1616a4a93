The rest seem ready to head to Zambia.“I am only waiting for confirmation today before announcing the squad,” said Senong. “The response has been very good. This means we will be able to travel to the Cosafa Cup with a strong squad. “And I understand the reasons given by the Stellenbosch coach on why Le Roux cannot travel with us. He called me and explained that they want to win the NFD and that Le Roux is a regular in the team.”The NFD has a couple of matches left before the recess and also has the Nedbank Cup qualifiers on 12 and 13 December.Senong is happy that his matriculants are done with their exams, saying clubs will have no reason to refuse requests for these players.“The majority of these players are still unknown but they will be household names very soon,” the coach pledged.The squad, which defeated neighbours Lesotho 5-0 in a friendly a fortnight ago, started their camp on Friday.
