    NEW research has found that inequality in Mzansi has
increased with wealth becoming ever more concentrated among the rich.According to the World Inequality Lab, SA is one of the
world's most unequal countries, with 10% of earners capturing 66% of the
national income."For the first time ever, this report examines how
global growth has been shared among individuals in the entire world since the
1980s, with a particular focus on emerging countries where inequality data had
previously been sparse or non-existent," said Thomas Piketty, co-ordinator
of the report.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstxnN6-6UuOL0gw41vqGgckY5Q6SjL8Kz10Vf24gTI1LdgJygiE-Y8scO8zasPiP0l83DNlrevCS7UmyoQDzJAAlDEPDjllDD_woTJS6mttLotqXNbbfGDfdD8RdK7oWQXd1gBahKDwyrIWNp1py59_J2vFHFTZrZDUx5uMfCggk9ey5wnP2MaDr5A54pteP32CfTq2j0DmA2EihJk_Zk2OCdT25kDBwOcyZ2yRIVkTH8-1iR3Tja6GY43-HoYUnIafys3A28ZjK7v-zjU957vNsumGyFE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLCJ_nWg8Ow9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

earners held 8.8% of SA's wealth in 1987, and had increased their share to
19.2% by 2012.The report found that wealth inequality had grown most
rapidly in North America, China, India, and Russia, while remaining stable -
albeit at high levels - in sub-Saharan Africa.Average South African income"The fact that inequality trends vary so greatly among
countries, even when countries share similar levels of development, highlights
the important role of national policies in shaping inequality," said Lucas
Chancel, general co-ordinator of the report."For instance, consider China and India since 1980:
China recorded much higher growth rates with significantly lower inequality
levels than India. The positive conclusion of the World Inequality Report is
that policy matters, a lot," Chancel added.The report found that average South African income (in
dollar terms) increased from $15 437 in 2000 to $18 578 in 2011, but then
declined to $18 079 by 2016.The results match a recent Oxfam SA report that found just
three South African billionaires had more wealth than the bottom half of the
country's earners.Those three were identified as retail tycoon Christo Wiese,
Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg, and Aspen Pharmacare chief executive Stephen
Saad.However, the Oxfam SA figures date from January 2017, before
the Steinhoff debacle wiped out a significant portion of Wiese's wealth.The World Inequality Lab linked wealth inequality to tax
avoidance by wealthy individuals."The establishment of a global financial registry to
record the ownership of financial assets would deal severe blows to tax evasion
and money laundering, and would enhance the effectiveness of progressive
taxation, which is an essential tool in reducing economic inequality,"
said report co-ordinator Gabriel Zucman.Global wealth inequality looks set to continue its current
trajectory if global economic policies remain in place, said the organisation."The combination of privatisations and increasing
income inequality has fuelled the rise of wealth inequality - within countries
and at the global level, private capital is increasingly concentrated among a
few individuals. This rise was extreme in the US, where the share of wealth
held by the top 1% rose from 22% in 1980 to 39% in 2014," said Emmanuel
Saez, co-ordinator of the report.FIN24
