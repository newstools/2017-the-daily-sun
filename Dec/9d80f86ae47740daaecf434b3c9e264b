They wanted him to join them but he was never interested in that life. Now they’ve killed him. “I was home with my wife when my daughter came and said Motsoto had been attacked. We rushed to the scene and found him burning and screaming in pain. We couldn’t get close as cops stopped us but he was still alive.” Motsoto’s mum, Malebohang Mosoeu (49), said: “My son wanted to be a soldier but now his dream has been cut short.”Police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele said: “A group of men attacked a man in the street. He ran into a nearby house. He was dragged out, assaulted and burnt to death. “A case of murder was opened but no arrests have been made yet.”
