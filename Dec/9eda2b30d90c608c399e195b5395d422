In fact, as a safety option, keep the money that you want to use for things like living expenses, debit orders for accounts and personal debts in an account that you won’t make use of.Because many of us get paid a bit earlier in December, it can be easy to lose track of what needs to be deducted at the end of the month.I tend to be a bit of a control freak in the sense that I always avoid spending money until all my debit orders have gone off, so it really helps to have a set amount put aside for those necessities.It helps me set boundaries for myself.Transfer any cash you’re planning on using for personal use over the festive holidays into an account where you have the option of withdrawing or swiping without running the risk of using any money that you can’t spend.Pay off some of your debts - if you're able toLook, I’m pretty sure most people would prefer not to have to be a responsible adult during the month of December (me included).However, several experts in this Fin24 article on How you should spend your bonus money suggest that this time of the year is the perfect opportunity to, if not completely pay off your debts, then at least make a sizeable dent so that your future installments (depending on the account you’re paying off) will at least be a little lower.Look at your accounts and start small – according to Fin24, store cards and credit cards are good short term loans to pay off first as the interest rates on those cards tend to increase by up to 20% annually. Keep an emergency stash (not necessarily under your bed)Similar to my first point, except this is the amount you want to have separated from any planned expenses on your itinerary.So, aside from holiday expenses (including outings and getaway trips), gift buying, living costs and debt, having something set aside for unforeseen events or circumstances means you’ll be prepared for that sudden washing machine repair or car issue. Lastly, splurge a littleBook that spa treatment, buy that outfit that you wouldn’t normally buy and treat yourself to that restaurant you’ve been meaning to try for ages. While the aim is to make sure you spend your money without getting yourself into a fix, having a bit of balance and spoiling yourself should definitely be part of the package deal. After all, you deserve a few rewards for your hard work and for making it through the year.
