    THE Joburg Open has struggled with rain over the past few years and this week’s host of the golf tournament, Randpark Golf Club, is taking no chances. They’ve even used a local superstition and a bit of sangoma magic to try and make sure the tournament is not rained out.This year’s edition of the Joburg Open in February had to be shortened to 54 holes as rain washed out the third round at the Royal Joburg and Kensington Golf Club.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvDQY8DDkRHSOpu4GHKKmi-NgPy5T4-TTkMdPL6xH-Cb1YSYJ4tYeKGBwdaz3xs1mFW7ymzpjlVhw8D9cHrE6J0Oebs6eP884SbhyN76cx2xHCmj0oNSJpW-ynvB7TPia1xljUVVIjz_z5nBQWJqGeT2l5-ZhUbiN8FJ_gX87I_G8nT7UoWoyLXqxF1n0FAS1PV1g0GFSWty-ljqJhXnu7Iht9dUoKX2gRRasQGOSBL8wHsqBeBuN2wnzGSLMFujlOWmWAIm3q-U3zWceQoD8gvYgkuKCI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEeuUfs5NPC-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Then another employee decided to add a sangoma’s touch by placing a saucer with a glass of water turned upside down on it. The glass and saucer were placed over the spot where the fork was buried.Gaby told Daily Sun she had learnt those skills when a friend told her to try them when rain clouds threatened her husband’s 70th birthday party, being held outside.“A friend told me about the broom and fork idea. I thought she was kidding but I did it, and it didn’t rain. “In fact there was a cloud right above our house and it still didn’t rain! “So when it rained the whole of Tuesday, we thought we’d try everything, including this trick.”Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni said the tournament wouldn’t be affected by rain. He said such rituals were often done when there was a wedding or royal ceremony. He said the broom in the tree would chase the rain away.“A buried fork is used to make the place dry and not too muddy and wet.“The saucer with a glass of water turned upside down is to make sure it doesn’t rain,” said Mahlinza.
