    After age 21, there really aren’t a lot of birthdays to look forward to.But that’s all about to change. A round-up of recent sex research from online platform Happify, addressed a super-important question: When do people have the best sex of their lives?if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1166195494&t=artid%3dd08c2cf9-21b1-4290-9233-d794d2d6a49c%26accreditation%3dhealth24%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/Umswenko-Wasesun&sz=300x250&c=1166195494&t=artid%3dd08c2cf9-21b1-4290-9233-d794d2d6a49c%26accreditation%3dhealth24%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>According to people in their 50s and 60s (aka those who would know), the best sex of their lives happened in their 40s – specifically at age 46. Damn!The round-up featured a slew of other cool factoids about sex. Among them, couples that do the cheeky once a week, on average, are the happiest. So seriously, don’t sweat it if you’re not doing it every day like your super-loud neighbours. (We get it, you like each other.)However, there’s a good reason to keep getting dirty between the sheets: The round-up found that older couples that have regular sex are happier than those who do it less often.On a final note, nearly 50% of couples said the best sex of their lives was with their current partner – regardless of age.So, as you near that epic 46th birthday, be sure to choose your lover wisely.- Health24
