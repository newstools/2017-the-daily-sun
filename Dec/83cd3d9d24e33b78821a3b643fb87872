describing the events and how the mother was led to protect her child’s rapist.She was initially charged with rape, child abuse,
defeating the ends of justice, and of aiding, instructing and commanding
someone to commit rape.She was acquitted of the rape and child abuse charges.According to the evidence and the court papers, the woman
and her husband, who are both Mozambican nationals, had a fight last year
November.The woman was carrying the infant on her, and she
followed the man who stormed out and went to his car.The man tried speeding off, but the woman grabbed the
door and was dragged for a few metres.Her screaming attracted a neighbor, who upon
investigation was horrified to find the baby lying on the ground.It was also revealed that she was bleeding from her
private parts.A doctor at Chris Hani examined her.The doctor took samples from the baby’s genitals and
discovered semen, which was not enough to extract DNA.The judge was very shocked that the mother would assist
and even hide the identity of a man who raped her daughter.
