I didn’t know snakes could climb so high.“It was just lying there and relaxing. When I noticed it there I screamed, and it raised its head and tried to bite me. I’m still scared. I am afraid that even though we killed the snake, another will come.” Another resident came across a snake on top of a wardrobe. “I was lucky not to be bitten. My reflexes were quick and I ran outside. We killed it together with neighbours but since that day I have been struggling to sleep because I don’t know if there is another one hiding somewhere.” Nothemba Samte (41) said even in their homes they are scared. “These snakes are stressing us. We fear snakes are going to kill us and harm our kids. “Sofaya town has been renamed Snake Town because big snakes keep terrorising us.“They appear anywhere, anytime. We have killed more than four snakes already and fear the more we kill, the more will come. We don’t know if it’s normal or witchcraft.” Sangoma Khanyisile Dorah Kheswa (59) said sometimes snakes that visit families are ancestors.“But the same snakes found in different houses has nothing to do with ancestors. I think they were sent by evil people.” She said people must mix ash with herbs, rub it on their houses and shout at the snakes to go back to whoever sent them.
