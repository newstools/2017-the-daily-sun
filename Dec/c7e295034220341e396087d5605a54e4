We have goals this season, which are to win two or more trophies. Brockie has to help us win two trophies and so far we have only won one,” said Matthews.Despite being contracted to United until 2020, Brockie handed the club a transfer request following interest from Sundowns.But Matthews reckons they have as big an ambition in the league as their rich neighbours.Matsatsantsa a Pitori visit Orlando Pirates at Orlando Stadium tonight (7.30pm), looking to convert the four games they have in hand into points.Their catch-up programme started very well with a 1-0 win over Ajax Cape Town last week in their first league match in a month.Tenth in the standings, United have collected 13 points from six matches.Interestingly, they trail log leaders Baroka FC by only six points and second-placed Bucs by five.A win against the stuttering Buccaneers could catapult them to sixth in the table.The standings do not paint an accurate picture, as the points gap between teams is quite small.Unlike many other teams, United have been consistent this season, winning four, losing one and drawing only one of their six matches.With four victories they could be right at the top and mount a serious challenge for league honours.Matthews refuses to look that far ahead, however, explaining his squad may need some rejuvenation following the rigours of the Confed Cup.The Buccaneers, on the other hand, have no such worries as Milutin Sredojevic has a fully fit squad.
