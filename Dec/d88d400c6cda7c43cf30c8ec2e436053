People come from far away to dump their rubbish outside my shack.“There is a rubbish transfer centre just a few metres away from here, but people don’t use it. I can’t even stay in my shack because of the bad smell and flies.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsufqYejS5JC_VlX9aJKF-GRqisXr_pU5ywgpWKl4HyCs7ndXTww00rGsNQcIJhhcu1xvsghHrBn9j8JW3BLNDrXKN393YVrhXYO21yqWPWXjbwWXShtQNWK27ivPIkcDlLpxVO7YrP_zpwd_FXpZvJRC9FEbd8soHbQmJAGKRr8NaqnFjyZI6afzIaGOVjPAAHfzzA9fS_tda1PRyeWiq-Suzp5KwSNq0XOppGCHWnEX_KD6G8xuniAg4uX9OPLUYyhPICtUBZNp_fYdCO3GS5GlCObBGQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDME_UKeJWClEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
