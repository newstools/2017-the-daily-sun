This incident convinced him of the need for armed struggle and controlled sabotage to pressurise the apartheid regime into negotiations," reads the profile.Chiba joined the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto weSizwe (MK), in 1961. By 1962, he had been promoted to platoon commander."His commitment and leadership was recognised by his comrades and he was asked to become a member of the Second National High Command in 1963.""Chiba was brutally tortured by the Special Branch when he was arrested after his comrades were caught sabotaging a railway line. The Special Branch failed in their efforts to break him and, not being able to extract any information from him, it was unable to lay charges. Chiba was released – deaf in one ear from the torture he endured – only to be re-detained in 1964 and subjected to further remorseless interrogation," reads the profile.Chiba was charged with membership of the High Command of MK in October 1964 and sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment on Robben Island."On his release in 1982, he became active in the United Democratic Front and continued to work in the ANC underground."Chiba was elected as a Member of Parliament in the first and second democratic elections in 1994 and 1999.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/struggle-stalwart-laloo-chiba-dies-20171208Version
