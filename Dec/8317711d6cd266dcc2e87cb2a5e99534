They go into the break at the top of the league table with 30 points from 15 matches, followed by Cosmos with 28 points.Highlands player Mothobi Mvala said: “We have been working hard as a team and every player is capable of scoring, which is good for us.”Meanwhile, Mthatha Bucks, Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Eagles have been leaky in defence as they each conceded more than 20 goals in the first round of action.
