He described the clothes and I knew they belonged to my son.” She said she told Libongwe’s family and they went to the river. “I hoped we would find them swimming.” Ziphozonke said they found the clothes but the boys weren’t there.“Cops were alerted and we searched the river,” she said.The bodies were found hours later. It appeared they had drowned. “My heart is broken. I’m still trying to accept that I will never see my son again. He was a clever boy,” she said.According to Prem Balram, Reaction Unit South Africa’s spokesman, residents assisted the cops with the search and recovered the boys’ naked bodies but there was no sign of life. Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, said two inquest dockets were opened at Verulam Police Station.“The police are investigating the circumstances around the incident.”
