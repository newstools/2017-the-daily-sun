He was such an asset to our family.”He has ruled out the incident being part of the ongoing taxi war.“I don’t think this has anything to do with the taxi business. “It could be something else. Young people have their own issues with one another,” said Zwelibanzi.The dead man’s uncle, Godfrey Madyo (47) was in great shock and couldn’t believe his nephew was dead.“I had just seen him a couple of minutes before it happened.“I didn’t think he wouldn’t ever be with us again. Sive was a humble person who loved laughing. I will forever miss him,” said Godfrey. Residents described Sive as a humble and generous person in the community.They said he bought lots of sweets and chips for kids to enjoy themselves on Saturday’s public holiday.“He wasn’t part of any gang.“He was an upright person who loved laughing and would play with kids in the neighbourhood,” said a resident.“He was the type of person who had no enemies. We still wonder why he was killed.” Locals have vowed to help the police hunt for the killers because Sive never fought with anyone.Western Cape Police Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said: “A case of murder was opened following a shooting at 9.55am in Marikana, Philippi East on Monday.“A 27-year-old man was shot and fatally wounded. No one has been arrested at this stage,” Rwexana said.
