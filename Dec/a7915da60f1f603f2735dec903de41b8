They used a stone to break the windscreen and pour water inside,” she said.A witness told her a family member was seen putting clothes in the car and setting it on fire. Police were alerted and the suspect was arrested.Phumla said: “The relative kept saying he knew why he did what he did and now we suspect the fire in the house was also caused by him. “We lost everything but he still has all his clothes.”Phumla said they believe the suspect might be using drugs.“He said the police must let him go so he can go and see his sangoma,” she said.The car was going to be sold but now it is damaged.Sergeant Mthokozisi Gama of the Lwandle police said a 34-year-old suspect was bust and charged with malicious damage to property. “It is alleged the suspect burnt down a motor vehicle in Yoto Street in Lwandle,” said Gama.He said the case is still under investigation.
