two million beneficiaries, roughly 20% of the total scheme.Concerns though had been raised about the deal's total cost,
as initial reports suggested the SAPO contract would cost more than that of
incumbent service provider CPS.News24 has seen the signed service level agreement, as
submitted to the Constitutional Court on December 8.The total cost for the first year of services will be R2 250
261 437.It also falls within National Treasury's budget for the
grants scheme per annum.The deal, though, will not cover those recipients who
receive their grants in cash at merchants and vendors, especially in deep rural
areas.Existing infrastructure will continue to be used to cover
the roughly 30% of beneficiaries who still receive their grants in cash, while
Sassa goes out on tender to find a new service provider for cash payments.For those parts of the scheme that the Post Office will
handle, the following pricing schedule was agreed to.The largest expenditure will be the delivery of cash at Post
Office and Sassa pay points, which will cost roughly R55.60 per beneficiary for
a total of R1.26bn.The cost to produce new Sassa-Post Office cards will be
R6.71 per beneficiary, which will come to a total of R465m for the first year.Similarly, the cost of servicing the two million
beneficiaries going through banks will also be R6.71. The total cost for this
service will be R161m.Branch services at Post Office outlets will be R12.41 per
beneficiary, costing a total of R148m.Capital expenditure will be R2.60 per beneficiary, at a
total cost of R211m.Cash paymentsAs mentioned, Sassa will be forced to find a new service
provider for the 2.8 million beneficiaries who prefer to receive cash under the
current payment system.Roughly 67% of recipients receive their cash at Sassa
outlets, while a further 26% go through ATMs, and 7% use merchants and vendors.Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Director
General Mpumi Mpofu said Sassa would be utilising existing infrastructure to
continue paying cash payments for six months after the April deadline.It would have to go out on tender to find a new service
provider, as this segment of the scheme would not be ready before the April
2018 deadline.Mpofu stressed that CPS would have no part to play in the
cash payment portion of the scheme, under "current terms", beyond the
deadline.It is not yet clear how much more the total costs of the
scheme will rise when this portion is factored in.Beneficiary dataQuestions still remain around the securing of beneficiary
data.The migration of the data from CPS to Sassa is still
ongoing, and there is no indication yet if CPS has been ordered to destroy its
database upon completion.The issue of legal deductions, which sparked the initial
court challenge against the CPS deal, is currently before the North Gauteng
High Court in Pretoria.Sassa indicated in May that it intended to appeal the
court's ruling that deductions were still commercially legal.NEWS24
