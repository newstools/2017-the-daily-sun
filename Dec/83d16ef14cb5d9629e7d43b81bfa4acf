She said Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi will later release national statistics, including the death toll on Gauteng roads.So far 59 pedestrians have died, of which 10% are children under the age of five. Nkosi-Malobane said factors adding to the deaths were speeding, drinking and driving, as well as texting and driving. In a message to motorists, the MEC said: “If you speed or drink and drive, you will die!”She said traffic cops’ focus will be shifted to urban areas as people are comfortable and likely to act recklessly on the road as they get closer to home.“Because you think you are approaching home, you start to be careless. Most victims of crime are attacked close to home.“The same applies to accidents.“When people are near their homes, they remove their seat belts and drive as they please. They think nothing will happen but they end up being statistics.”She said more women now tend to drink and drive than before. “But taxi drivers in Gauteng have behaved better,” she said.
