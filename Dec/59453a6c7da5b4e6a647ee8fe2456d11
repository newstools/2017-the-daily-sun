    ZIMBABWE’S ruling Zanu-PF party provinces have reportedly
endorsed President Emmerson Mnangagwa's decision to appoint former army chief
Constantino Chiwenga and Minister of Defence, State Security and War Veterans
Kembo Mohadi as his deputies.According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, the party said that the two "bring vast
experience that will benefit both the party and the nation".Mnangagwa last week named the former army chief who led a
coup that ended Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule, as one of his two deputies in the
ruling party.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstXyF3_Hj4tABDMwn05v1kFA_wBfuA8Dp99pIaoCCow3R6vm1nPGR5T0l3X56YT4hFKh4TsHK4DkTWg7noOexNw0qlCoai-LCKqRHoVfwBMuM1FVEdjtjHavPx3l-fExeQOOhwi-qq95fuuQTHsLFFK39f73JrVHz8oIIcAQBU8SItbRdZYoMf7Tn7mPSTn6oL0x-3Sh3sw6g3pWdJnhpgmsCDNZtUI89GiEacJzdOYfSfNVb9Krxp4sgmf7D0VhzwDOGPYUm-TkslvRa4_ecYCUZyIGWpl87H0VA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP1lBZS-pbHpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

to state vice presidents. Two other top military officials were earlier this
month awarded ministerial posts.Zanu-PF said the appointments were in line with the
party’s time-honoured practice of abiding by the 1987 Unity Accord signed
between the former President Robert Mugabe and late national hero Joshua Nkomo.
Chiwenga retired last week, slightly over a month after
the military temporarily took control of the country on 15 November as internal
feuding escalated in Zanu-PF over then president Mugabe's succession.The takeover which the army said was targeting Mugabe's
corrupt allies came days after the 93-year-old leader had fired then deputy
Mnangagwa who had strong military ties and was widely tipped as the likely
successor.Mugabe's wife Grace had indicated interest in succeeding
her husband.The army's intervention was followed by mass street
protests against Mugabe and a motion to impeach the veteran ruler who resigned
in a letter to parliament as proceedings to recall him began.Zanu-PF then appointed Mnangagwa as Mugabe's replacement,
leading to his inauguration as the country's president on November 24. dffdfsavsasdfhttp://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/zanu-pf-says-yes-to-president-mnangagwas-choice-of-vps-20171227
