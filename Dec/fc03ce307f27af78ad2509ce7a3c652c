Mathonsi (42), from Soshanguve in Tshwane, said when the dreams first started he just brushed them off. “I thought it was just my mind and love for my country playing games with me. “But the dreams kept coming.” Mathontsi said when the dreams became more frequent he decided to share them with his friends and colleagues at the correctional centre where he works as a warder. “They all said I should contact Daily Sun. I hope Safa will see this article and, for the sake of the national team, contact me.” He said in the dreams his ancestors told him Mzansi’s ancestors were angry. “No ceremony has been done for them. Even when people were killed in a stampede, no ritual was performed to ensure it doesn’t happen again.” He said Bafana has lost many players because the ancestors were not respected. “We’re not in Europe. Safa has to bear that in mind. As Africans we do things in a different way. We report to the ancestors, who give and they take. Disrespect the ancestors at your own peril.” Mathonsi said if nothing was done, Bafana won’t play in Qatar in 2022. Dominic Chimhavi, Safa’s head of communications, said: “We don’t discuss issues pertaining to national teams with sangomas.”
