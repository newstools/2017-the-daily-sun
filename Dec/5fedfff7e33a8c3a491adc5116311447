Durban is always warm and I am having the time of my life,” she said.Mbuso Madlala (26) from Pietermaritzburg, KZN said the Durban beaches were his chilling spot.“This is the place where I spend my festive holidays. Nothing will change because of the rain.”Mthunzi Gumede, spokesman for eThekwini’s mayor, Zandile Gumede, said they had done everything to ensure visitors’ safety.“All our beaches are ready and activities have been planned to entertain the people. We have beach buddies who will assist everyone with directions and everything they need to know,” he said.Mthunzi said child minders would help children who went missing. “They have wristbands for the children so it is easy to get the parents’ details.“More parking space has been made available and lifeguards are on hand. Metro cops and SAPS members will constantly monitor the area to ensure safety,” he said.Experienced lifeguard Jaycee Thompson advised people on the beaches to be more careful. “The rain is causing river sand to wash into the sea, which makes visibility in the water difficult,” said Jaycee.“To avoid incidents of drowning they should swim in places where there are lifeguards and in between the erected safety flags.”
