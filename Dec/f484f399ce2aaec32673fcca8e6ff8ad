We are going to deal with them now,” said Nombuso.Zingisa Somdaka (36) heard a loud bang.“We were shocked when we saw a man under the car,” she said.“The driver did not even try to help the man he knocked down but instead ran away.” Another resident found beer inside the man’s car. “We are tired of people driving recklessly under the influence of alcohol,” the resident told the People’s Paper. “We’re going to sort them out because we know the police won’t help us.” Siyolise Matu (25) said the driver had been drinking. “I saw him and I asked myself why he didn’t sleep it off because he was drunk,” said Siyolise.Another witness said the driver probably fell asleep at the wheel and only woke up when he realised he had knocked a pedestrian down. “I saw him and even shouted, but he didn’t hear me because he was drunk and asleep,” said the resident.When the People’s Paper arrived at the scene, there was no sign of the driver. The injured pedestrian was rushed to hospital for treatment.Another resident said: “The injured boy was meant to be on the 11am bus to initiation school in Eastern Cape,” said the resident.Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said no case was opened.
