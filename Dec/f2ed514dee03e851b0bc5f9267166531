According to her brother Sabelo Mzuzu (45), she was approached by a man at the restaurant. He allegedly told her he knew the man who had robbed her and promised to help get her belongings back. Sabelo said his sister left with the man. They were going to a cop shop. “None of her friends knew the man. I want the cops to question him thoroughly,” said Sabelo. “The cops told me Nomathamsanqa was at the police station. “I made them aware she never made it back home after opening a case with the man.“Cops went to look for him on Monday and questioned him. “He told the police they had gone their separate ways after opening the case.” Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops are investigating the robbery and have opened a missing persons case.No one has been arrested yet.
