    WOMEN can only know if they have cancer if they go for regular check-ups. KZN MEC for Health Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo urged men to encourage their partners to get tested and be there for them throughout the process. Dhlomo was speaking on Tuesday during his visit to Port Edward Hospital near KwaNzimakwe, on the South Coast of KZN. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstMR1Wo5IB_9aJNUHOaIlSDFLaw-L3fzkzgLWWlOKX9hTCo49NQDDbLpRvWgck_BPK7SoTZRxr_TPBrvxMvfkl53diGChOKh8ytaxVpbzn42P_v0ldMeFnEueWTsKqs1yJQbB5fUQAp6uIls-wh3bVd5jA4FxzpfS1gQnROowYAqVURA22HLQYYd_Zy8nfgk4C33a4v1r_LGcGHowyXQDdhYvfofxk2zVpPaP0cDabCPwoW5WI5Q8Kj_M0Cqbo6zyOCSXkTQTUoRN0y5PA0IAiTRDK4dRI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEbKf1JXjk-OEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

If one of them doesn’t then it’s a sign something may be wrong. That’s when you visit a health facility,” he said.Dhlomo also said cervical cancer mostly affects women in their 30s. “It used to affect mostly older women in their 60s. The National Council has formulated the National Cervical Cancer Prevention Policy and the Breast Cancer Prevention Policy to ensure early symptoms are identified.” A resident, Nosipho Nxasana (39), said: “Cancer is painful but if it’s detected early, it can be treated. I will start doing regular check-ups with the help of my partner, as the MEC has said.”.
