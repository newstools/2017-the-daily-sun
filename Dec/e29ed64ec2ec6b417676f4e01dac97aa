The two had split up after only being together for three months.But when she left, she also left a short message for Phillip: “No woman will ever live here except me!” Now Phillip and his new wife cannot find peace in their home. The past three years have been hell.He said he was unable to sleep in the same bed as his wife because of a creature that apparently roams the house and doesn’t want to see him and Popi in bed together.“The creature targets me,” Popi said. “It does nothing to Phillip. Even my child cannot sleep at night. We have been to more than 20 sangomas and inyangas and they have all told us the same thing. “They’ve said there’s something in the house that my husband’s ex-lover left behind, but we can’t seem to fight it.“We have also been to prophets but nothing seems to help”She said it only became better when she slept in the dining room, leaving her husband alone in the bedroom. “We need help to get rid of this thing. We are also pleading with the ex to come back and forgive my husband.”
