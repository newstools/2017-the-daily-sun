    Earlier this year, the nation was saddened by the death of Karabo Mokoena, who was murdered by her boyfriend, but she is not the only one. Too many women are abused and killed without anyone hearing about it. Dr Benny Obayi, acting national executive director at Child Welfare South Africa, said the real solution to protecting girls is not only to teach girls how to protect themselves. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv8WXTYTYYztBLHiNvaJBSFx1DerdusMCq2hov05JZDIHwaKM-WJ_ordfy4o-nEGQwAwk8an-60Q3PsWNZCF96How4dzW_Z2s5SZmd8e8Xz-8F-ivH6YcEPVzL3zxeGMIBER0msNc5ZI310CrlSMXvJqSL5oy49NdJXm_xJdE9YaK6XKtigMkiqg1Ap7rWzIuX6pRwr0AQhk-LhNS6I64d6ApdGeWn1ZkaoBTZDcxI_s2ZHrfo9GXoyfTOuzuI4ml941qZ-sfyXOphdvYnFPrObpbHchN0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM9vl5FT3nc8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Boys must be taught from an early age to protect and care for women. “Starting with their mother, their sisters and relatives, boys should be coached in what used to be commonly known as chivalry. “Our young men must understand that you can be strong, but still loving and caring towards women. “We need to tell boys that when a girl says no, that’s the end of it. No pushing, no insisting, no more trying to persuade her.” The initiative also looks to help boys make life choices that lead to improved skills in relating to women and girls, through planned self-care and positive interaction with girls as well as increased community participation. The focus is to guide their behaviour by teaching them how to understand and appreciate the differences between the genders, while also improving communication and relationship skills. This campaign is important because by improving healthy relationships between genders, the possibilities of correcting harmful stereotypes increases. “No girl or woman has a duty to stop rape. Boys and men have a duty to stop raping and murdering women and children
