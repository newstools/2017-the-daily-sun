I didn’t know that at the time and told him to put it back,” she explained.What shocked Itumeleng’s parents was that their son had never shown any interest in swimming.“He had never even mentioned it to us. All we knew was he was into movies,” said shocked Joyce. Itumeleng drowned while swimming at a dam in Namibia Kasi, miles away from home. When Daily Sun arrived at the dam in East End, Bloemfontein, Joyce was crying uncontrollably at the Heidedal police van. The family and cops were waiting for police divers to recover his body.She said: “Why didn’t the others drown? My son was not alone here. Why my child?”She said Itumeleng left soon after she had told him to put the vaseline back. “I thought he would be back. “Now I will never see him again. I didn’t know that at the time. He will never sleep in the house with us ever again,” said devastated Joyce.Divers recovered Itumeleng’s body, clad only in underpants, from the dam. One of the boys said they had tried to pull him out but failed.His father, Lucky Bangani (33), said he received the sad news after work.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi confirmed the incident and said no foul play was suspected.
