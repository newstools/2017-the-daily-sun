Some expressed their anger on Facebook:Lisakhanya Sodiya: “Is violence against the mother okay? She leaves the child for 24 hours. This is what you get here in SA.”Letlhogonolo Gail: “Iyoh eish ... she’s still drunk but she’s breastfeeding. Oh gosh.”Palesa Mofokeng: “You can tell the baby is a couple of months old.

She deserves more than a klap.”Some social media users also condemned the family members who forced the mother to breastfeed the child, pointing out that it posed a danger to the baby.Ruth-Ann Augustine: “Whatever is coming from that breast is not going to be good for the baby. They should just bottle feed her with formula.”Nathisinazo Lena: “They could have just bought milk for the baby ... the mother is dirty.”
