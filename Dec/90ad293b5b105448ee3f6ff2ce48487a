    A VILLAGER got the shock of his life last Saturday when he
awoke to sounds of someone breaking into his house – only to find it was two
elephants!According to Coconuts,
an unnamed 28-year-old living in Petani Village, northern Indonesia was fast
asleep when terrible sounds of the kitchen wall being smashed woke him.Panicking, he shouted to his neighbours for help. He
rushed into the kitchen, and there were two elephants eating his rice from where
it was stored in a cupboard.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window,a=b.performance;c&&a&&a.now&&(a=a.now(),(b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[]).push({label:c,type:4,value:a,uniqueId:"rt."+Math.random()}))};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu46Q0G1xmrnbi5vwgW38sEhpoOuKt5DkK0WXvWOpkbnFUhqxM6cpvZMfzD5eua3-cKDPbYAcHsLMBoK0RMdk1f0XvxvaNlEZCUDJi27TOUx3LVuYZ538pY33UBIRgjsRl5Px8YgUs8Vegs-sctdf7oDbIhJIFSLzXw-MgxbyyfmePqtyfyHAYN1jPAG3Xwc3hd1ckk4W9Jk7K50sgYlEawx9RPAw1Wde4LCVCLyrIRCcW3C6CehpxK7c1hIZZaYAO3PzeBuY8tZRVHi8ZdBo1BsxCuZwRc59m6nQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNQ35wOEDInvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

without further damage, although the homeowner was so traumatised he slept the
rest of the night at a friend’s house.Muhammad Arif, spokesman for environmental group Himpunan
Pegiat Alam, is quoted as saying:“The two elephants that entered the kitchen are still in
the vicinity of the settlement, because their habitat has been destroyed by the
people and turned into palm oil plantations.” This is an increasing problem in Indonesia. The country
is a leading supplier globally of palm oil, which is used for cooking,
cosmetics, and biofuel. The palm oil industry comes at a huge cost to the
environment and animals like elephants whose natural habitat is being destroyed
as more plantations are developed.
