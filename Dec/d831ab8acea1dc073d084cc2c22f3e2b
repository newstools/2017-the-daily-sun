PHUMLANI Shazi was on his way to visit a friend last Thursday. But he never arrived at the friend’s house. Instead, he was attacked by vicious dogs as he walked on the street just a few houses away from his friend’s house in Randfontein. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvgCHDboNyV16mh2P4Cpo8pKunfh513OdpJvH4vMpU3rLC0JjdxG_KwbCj0OjYBOBPaBMG-OiuKqG9R3uU5N0bqBaE3BMeVu2k_2c62gIcu-7KqVa6sfvOmvopM-hDp8HSwiIO8O2pyKIYjj-9F8yfqZFLQ_aUuq9S0baqtBlu3zsbnYF4voanwKro5xBcw_ss2cRjRY5WUOewKizha0_vLD7Q5xgoUEL71kkTgMolV4IsS2mCx5YcncgijlutMkql9kMRpRjuzIKElNhbvjucHXl5Q_ck\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNPO6zoKHY0xEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said they both scratched and bit him as he screamed for help. Luckily, a stranger driving past saw the commotion. He whistled to distract the dogs from the attack. Luckily for Phumlani, the trick worked. The dogs left him alone and ran towards the car on the other side of the road. Phumlani said he got up and started running for dear life. “That person really saved my life. If it wasn’t for him I probably would be dead by now. My entire body is still in pain. I had to go see a doctor who gave me an anti-rabies vaccine. “I wish I could meet the stranger who saved my life.” Phumlani said later he went to the house where the dogs came from with two of his friends. “We went there to tell the owner that his dogs nearly killed me and that I had lost my takkies and a phone at his gate. The man didn’t believe me and instead got angry but I’m just grateful my life was spared,” he said.
