    ALTHOUGH he is only nine years old, entertainer Sinothando Hlulani is building a massive following. The boy, popularly known as Ndlovu, first became known for a video of himself reciting his clan names. Since then, his fame has been growing so much that many have started calling him the “youngest people’s bae”. Even EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, the first people’s bae, has said the boy deserves the title! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssds3RyqKKgzQq9IgvLAGqKIvJlB-SEKuwRwZksRVjjZ8v1cjvyGlzFRxPCnyuLopcHSgKVqE-851_dZxcPxIGjnvhWni4HeC1uOHieDHLFrGv3_l2fR6Ks3RUpKAHGnnrrsLh22jTlmpkxzVvbVI54dQyidiy0O16FU3_nf3LRecU9QkQRzr_kT8U5oAuoHqJhUK8FKjA4__lDoNcY_CZg3u8AFBKFZqWPXYiilEbnD7Yk-BsqoV_9v0LrXA-6Yt8bLF4eeF9sY9afjt_Romh1OWoB7Lo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO9Kr0qU8ZK-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The boy, who comes from a poor family, said: “I’m happy to be here and I appreciate the support from the people.” Ndlovu’s manager Monwabisi Hena said he was using the child’s fame to better his life. He said a fundraising concert was being planned to build a new house for Ndlovu and his family. “I saw the talent the boy has for entertaining people. What he does on stage is not rehearsed. He just does what comes to his mind and people love him,” Monwabisi said. Ndlovu’s voice has already been used by musicians in his home town of Port Elizabeth, and he has been interviewed on various radio stations. Mila Maseti (14), who attended the performance on Tuesday, said: “I’m so happy that I finally met Ndlovu. I’ve got all his videos. He’s very funny and I love him.” Event organiser Mbasa Soga said the crowd loved Ndlovu. “They even threw coins on stage for him. I’m happy he came and entertained people,” said Mbasa. Ndlovu is working on his debut album, which will be released in February.
