    A LATE night pee on the edge of a cliff ended in tragedy
when the woman fell off the edge and died after relieving herself.According to Coconuts,
an unnamed 23-year-old German tourist in Bali, Indonesia had spent last
Wednesday night with friends at a cafe at the top of Suluban Beach. At about
1.30am, she and her friends decided to go outside near the cliffs to chat. Soon after, the woman walked further into the darkness to
pee. Apparently she climbed over a barrier right near the cliff’s edge, did her
pee, but then slipped and fell 80 meters to her death.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssRFvX2ycBwOUI7JUWL_SAm8JyzemTKDIR4yWY6MbtaEKt1cbSHCgeyZf7uKWI4rMQL17OKCVXvJ-9tGhlmOTZWuvMkRlA-f7P6MG1pWlYtO6LrHmOh2OcF3gbxISaUuw0ZnqL0kw0f2enIModtv2SC3DnxB329Df0YdNordV9oGKYm-8gibpazG1_TGxNQaw-KyD6ORo3rHoLQ0UKUe09-COr-y36uIM2b63adCumpkAKE2LOI9uetQ0ahdztiErfNznGZagq-VJzh07xOp1d-1xniavp9Bt-vzQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFtl5IuCjn2KEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

tragedy struck.“Due to the conditions, it was dark, the victim did not
realize she was urinating on the edge of cliff. And when she got up, she
slipped and fell to the bottom of the cliff,” South Kuta Police Chief I Nengah
Patrem told VIVA News.The darkness and steep cliffs meant it took four hours
for lifeguards to reach her, where she was discovered to have died.“The victim was found lying on a rock at the bottom of
the cliff. The victim was dead with a number of open wounds and fractures all
over her body,” South Kuta Criminal Investigation Unit inspector Andi Muhamad
Nurul Yakin told NusaBali.
