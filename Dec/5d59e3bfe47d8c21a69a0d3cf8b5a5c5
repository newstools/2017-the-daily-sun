Former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor claimed on Facebook that Mbalula was in Dubai with the son of new ANC secretary-general and Free State Premier Ace Magashule, who also has been linked to the Guptas. After receiving a stream of abuse on Twitter, Mbalula wrote: “Safa ngama Gupta. I pity those who have never been to Dubai. Hurry up. The gates are closing. “The law is coming that bars you from visiting Dubai, because it’s allegedly owned by the Guptas.”In another tweet, he said: “The Dubai sensationalists, some of them are probably tweeting from the rooftop of Burj Khalifa.” The angry tweets sent by South Africans in response to Mbalula included the following: Dr Ngqulunga wrote: “Ace Magashule’s son also is alleged to be attending a meeting in Dubai with Mbalula. Joemat Peterson also is attending.” Mhlengi Nqoba: “Well, I’ve just been blocked by y’all’s tweleb minister of police. Apparently Mr Mbalula is thin-skinned.”Don Fraser: “I see clown cop Mbalula is sending Christmas greetings from Dubai. Those thieving bastards have no shame. In spite of all exposure, Gupta ministers blatantly accept their bribes in Dubai.”
