outbreak response teams across the city to "help educate the public"
on preventing the spread of listeriosis.Health and Social Development MMC Mpho Phalatse called on
residents to educate themselves on the types of food that are most likely to
contain listeria, and what preventative measures to take.She said that pregnant women and the elderly with
compromised immunity were particularly at risk.About 36 people have succumbed to the disease, which can be
treated with antibiotics.The bacteria is found in soil, water and vegetation. Of the
557 cases reported, the majority have come from Gauteng. Of the 345 cases reported in Gauteng, 172 were reported from
the City of Johannesburg. Listeriosis is a foodborne illness that is associated with
eating a wide variety of food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes,
including dairy products and produce, fresh vegetables and fruit, as well as
ready-to-eat products.After infection, the incubation period varies and can be
between three to 70 days.NEWS24
