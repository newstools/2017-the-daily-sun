IT&rsquo;S one tap, 100 shacks and close to 400 people!Residents of Zenzele in Mayfield, Ekurhuleni, face this nightmare on a daily basis.They wake up as early as 4am to queue for water. Sometimes the tap runs dry. &ldquo;This means we have to walk a long distance to buy water from RDP houses,&rdquo; said Nokuthula Msibi, a community leader.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a struggle because there&rsquo;s so many of us, yet we only have one tap to cater for all of us.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re appealing to the municipality to erect more taps to make our lives easier.&rdquo;Vivian Sithole, a resident, said they experience the biggest challenge on weekends when everyone is doing their washing.&ldquo;We wash school clothes and our normal laundry,&rdquo; Vivian told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;So we all have to queue for water. &ldquo;The tap sometimes runs dry as it cannot cope with the demand. &ldquo;Our wish is for the municipality to provide us with tankers or to increase the number of taps as the demand for water is high. &ldquo;Surely, they must know that water is everything.&rdquo;The angry residents said they would not vote in the coming elections because they&rsquo;re not taken seriously.&ldquo;Just because we stay in shacks doesn&rsquo;t make us less human,&rdquo; Phineas Sibanda, a resident, told Daily Sun. &ldquo;We also have needs, like those who stay in houses.&rdquo; Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll visit the area to assess the need and check if taps were vandalised.&rdquo;
