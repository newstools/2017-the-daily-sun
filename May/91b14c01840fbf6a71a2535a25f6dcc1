A GROUP of underprivileged pupils in a Limpopo village will have no reason to be late for school anymore.The Qhubeka School Mobility Programme handed 250 bicycles last Wednesday to pupils from N&rsquo;Wanati High School in Makuleke Village outside Malamulele. The handover ceremony at the Makuleke playground was attended by community members, traditional leaders and officials from the departments of transport and basic education. Giovanni Mottalini, Qhubeka&rsquo;s operational manager, said the gift was enabled by the non-profit group Children in the Wilderness. &ldquo;The bicycles will help pupils to be on time in school,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are excited to create a better life for South Africa&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;Mottalini said Qhubeka, since 2005, had distributed about 75 000 bicycles &ndash; 20 000 since January &ndash; across Mzansi.Principal Solomon Maluleke said: &ldquo;It was very difficult for these poor learners to walk almost 2km every day to attend morning studies. &ldquo;And this as a result had a negative impact on the pupils.&rdquo;Grade 8 pupil Tinyiko Machevele (14) said her unemployed brother couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy her a bicycle and her parents had died. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good feeling to have a new bicycle for the very first time in my life. The situation was affecting my performance in a very big way,&rdquo; she said.
