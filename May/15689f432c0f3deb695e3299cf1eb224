She said it could take up to five years. She said the agency does not have the skills to manage the grants scheme. “We don’t have staff who understand biometrics at Sassa. We don’t have banking, payment, costing, modelling or cyber risk assessment skills.”She said the R6 billion estimate to prepare the agency in full would lower costs in the long run.Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza briefed the committee on progress towards developing a sustainable system of its own.Magwaza disagreed with Dlamini about the time span and said it could be achieved in two to three years.He assured the committee they would get rid of Cash Paymaster Services before next April. He said they had already made a move to bring in government departments such as the post office and home affairs to assist them.“Next week we are having a workshop with the post office to find out what services they can, or cannot, offer.” Portfolio committee chairwoman Rose Capa agreed the court judgment was anti-poor.Both she and Dlamini were unhappy with people who sent messages to beneficiaries on 31 March, telling them they wouldn’t get their grants.Capa said it was ruthless to play with the emotions of the have-nots, which they represent in parliament.
