COSATU has banned President Jacob Zuma from speaking at its events, the union federation said today.The country&rsquo;s democratic history has never faced an ANC president being banned from an alliance partner event.The trade union federation held a special central executive committee meeting on yesterday, after Zuma was booed and prevented from speaking during its May Day celebration in Bloemfontein."The special CEC meeting ultimately resolved that, in respect of the mandate from the workers and in line with the CEC resolution for him to step down, Zuma will no longer be welcome to address Cosatu," the general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said.Cosatu&rsquo;s largest affiliate Nehawu decided two days before Worker&rsquo;s Day that Zuma should not be allowed to attend the Workers&rsquo; Day celebration. However, Zuma arrived and got a unfriendly reception.The ANC sent Zuma to the celebrations as Cosatu did not dictate to the party who it should send to its events. Ntshalintshali said Cosatu no longer trusted and supported Zuma and wanted him to step down.The federation said it would communicate its decision to the ANC.Cosatu was critical in Zuma's election as ANC leader at the party&rsquo;s elective conference in Polokwane in 2007.The booing of ANC leaders, including ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte and chairperson Baleka Mbete, at Workers' Day events was an indication of Cosatu&rsquo;s frustration with a lack of leadership in the country and a weakening political situation.However the federation said its president Sdumo Dlamini was not asked to apologise for attending Zuma&rsquo;s birthday bash in Soweto on April 21. Dlamini told the crowds in Kliptown that the "workers were behind Zuma".Dlamini avoided questions about his attendance and was criticised for what he said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-banned-from-speaking-at-cosatu-events-20170523
