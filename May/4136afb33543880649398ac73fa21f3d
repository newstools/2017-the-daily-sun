THE DA is preparing to file a court application for a review of Brian Molefe&rsquo;s return to Eskom as CEO tomorrow.&nbsp;&ldquo;I instructed advocates to start preparing for a review,&rsquo;&rsquo; chair of the opposition party&rsquo;s federal executive James Selfe said on Friday.&nbsp;The party had held off on this action until it heard what Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said about Molefe&rsquo;s controversial return.At a Friday press conference, Brown endorsed Molefe&rsquo;s return &ndash; saying it was a better proposition for the fiscus to let him go back to the job he had resigned from in November.&ldquo;In terms of the Eskom board&rsquo;s proposal, Mr Molefe agreed to serve out the remainder of his original contract and to reconsider his contract I objected to,&rdquo; Brown said.&ldquo;The board&rsquo;s proposal, I believe, is a better value proposition for the fiscus than the previous proposal.&rdquo;&nbsp;This was after she told the board she would not accept a R30?million pension payout to Molefe for serving less than two years as CEO.His resignation, effective from 1 January, cut short a five-year contract. At the time, Molefe said he was leaving for the sake of good governance &ndash; in light of the allegations against him in the state capture report by Thuli Madonsela.He became a member of parliament, amid rumours that he would replace Pravin Gordhan. But Malusi Gigaba got the finance portfolio. This left the newest MP warming the ANC back bench &ndash; until the Eskom announcement.&nbsp;Brown is expected to meet the board next week to get the finer details of the board&rsquo;s recommendation that he return. At present, the DA does not seek to interdict him from working tomorrow.The review would be argued on grounds that Molefe's return is irrational and illegal, said Selfe.&nbsp;Purported telephone records in the state capture report placed Molefe frequently in the vicinity of the Gupta family&rsquo;s compound in Saxonwold, Jozi.&nbsp;A Gupta company, Tegeta Resources, received payment for a contract to supply coal during a national power supply crisis.Tegeta shareholders include President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s son Duduzane Zuma, along with brothers Ajay and Atul Gupta.The Eskom controversy forms part of allegations that the Guptas were favoured during sub-contracting decisions to keep the lights on &ndash;&ensp;because of their proximity to the president. )See page 10&nbsp;&ndash; News24&nbsp;
