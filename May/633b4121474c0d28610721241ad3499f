KAGISO cops on the West Rand once again received complaints about the latest scam targeting desperate, unemployed victims. Con artists are using the internet&rsquo;s workplace space to lure victims. The latest complaints were made by job-seekers who became targets after being promised employment at a local hospital in Kagiso. A &ldquo;Mr Dube, hospital HR personnel&rdquo; apparently assured them of jobs if they paid R1 000 into a Pep account. One of the victims allegedly went to the hospital to enquire about the jobs and was shocked to find the hospital&rsquo;s HR department knew nothing about any vacancies! She called &ldquo;Mr Dube&rdquo;, who claimed to be in class with new recruits. He told her to quickly deposit the cash and fax proof of payment and a CV so she could be in the next group of trainees. &ldquo;We want to appeal to the public to be cautious and guard against people who will take advantage of their desperation for employment,&rdquo; said Captain Solomon Sibiya.
