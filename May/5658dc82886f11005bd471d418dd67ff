DAWN Park police have sent a warning alert for men to be careful where they go for a poke. The warning comes after several cases were reported at the police station about incidents that happen at Boundry Road at Mapleton plots in Dawn Park, Ekurhuleni.Dawn Park SAPS spokeswoman Constable Nkemeleng Mabula said: &ldquo;Mapleton is well known as a prostitution hub.&ldquo;Most victims were attacked while busy with prostitutes. The station warns anyone attracted to prostitutes to refrain as this put their lives at risk.&rdquo;One of the victims, Lunga Majoro (35) from Dawn Park, told the Sun Team he was robbed and nearly got killed. &ldquo;I went there to get serviced. I was busy poking inside my VW golf when three men appeared from nowhere. They pointed firearms at me and ordered me to get out of the car.&ldquo;They took cellphones, a car stereo and my money,&rdquo; said Lunga. He said the magoshas who operate around there do not have a place to render their services.&ldquo;If you have a car, you poke in the car. If you don&rsquo;t, you poke in the field under the trees,&rdquo; he said.Lunga told Daily Sun that they know how dangerous the place is.&ldquo;But we go anyway because those magoshas are easily found and are cheap.&ldquo;You poke for as little as R20,&rdquo; he said.One of the magoshas said they were aware thugs were targeting their customers.She advised customers not to bring anything with them except the money to pay.
