Seipei is part of a rapidly growing biker community and is known as one of the first black woman riders in the country.&nbsp; She is a woman who has transformed the biking scene.&nbsp; She said the festival is also linked to uplifting those affected by domestic violence and other forms of abuse.&nbsp; She has travelled the country for four years on her bike to raise awareness around the abuse of women. Her birthday is on Women&rsquo;s Day.&nbsp;
