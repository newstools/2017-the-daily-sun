DESPERATELY ILL Sanda made a final wish to meet Lusanda Mcinga &ndash; and yesterday the famous gospel star was at his bedside.&nbsp; The boy (11) told her she was the most special person in the whole world to him.&nbsp; I HOPE FROM NOW ON I WILL NOT FEEL ANY MORE PAIN, HE SAID.&nbsp; When Sanda Matshayana told doctors he wanted to meet Lusanda, the message reached Western Cape Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela.&nbsp; And the MEC made the child&rsquo;s wish come true when he visited Sanda in hospital and brought the singer with him. The boy&rsquo;s mum, Khayakazi Titus, said she couldn&rsquo;t believe her eyes when she saw Lusanda had come to visit. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying when I saw my son&rsquo;s dream come true,&rdquo; said Khayakazi. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have much time left to live. He has liked Lusanda&rsquo;s music since he was two years old.&rdquo; The boy who is being treated at Vincent Pallotti Hospital in Cape Town suffers from short bowel syndrome. This means he only has 26% of his intestines left and according to doctors, he doesn&rsquo;t have much time left.&nbsp; Lusanda said when she heard about the boy&rsquo;s situation she wanted to make sure she did what she could for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here today because the MEC helped me come to Cape Town to fulfil the boy&rsquo;s dreams,&rdquo; said Lusanda.&nbsp; Reverend Mzukisi Faleni also visited Sanda and prayed for him.&nbsp; The MEC&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Ntomboxolo Makoba-Somdaka, said: &ldquo;We believe meeting Lusanda and praying together will heal the boy. We are waiting for a miracle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sanda&rsquo;s wants to go home to Engcobo in the Eastern Cape so he can spend his last days with his family. His doctors are working to make this happen, although they are worried about the quality of treatment at Eastern Cape hospitals.
