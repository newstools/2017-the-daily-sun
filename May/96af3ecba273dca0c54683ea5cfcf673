THE DA has filed an urgent two-part application with the North Gauteng High Court, opposing Brian Molefe's return to Eskom as chief executive."The first part of our urgent application seeks to interdict Brian Molefe from performing any duties or functions as group chief executive at Eskom, as well as to prevent him from receiving any benefits associated with the position," explained James Selfe, chairperson of the DA's federal council."The second part requests that the court review and set aside the reappointment of Mr Molefe as CEO of Eskom, as we believe this reappointment to be irrational."Molefe agreed to return to the post of Eskom CEO last week after resigning as an ANC Member of Parliament. He had resigned as chief executive in November 2016 after former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela connected Molefe with the Guptas in her report on state capture.Selfe said they are hoping the matter will be heard in court in the next two weeks.Meanwhile, Molefe reported for work on Monday at Eskom headquarters, Megawatt Park. Videos on social media revealed how Molefe received a warm welcome from some staff members, who greeted him with singing and dancing, while Molefe shows off some dance steps himself. http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/da-files-urgent-court-application-to-block-molefes-return-to-eskom-20170515
