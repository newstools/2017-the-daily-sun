DESPITE the Absa Premiership title race heading for a photo finish, Mamelodi Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane is relaxed.The defending champions are second in the standings, three points behind leaders Bidvest Wits with three matches to play.Said Mosimane; &ldquo;We have different priorities to Wits. The league is not in our hands. It&rsquo;s Wits&rsquo; league to lose. But we will continue fighting and trying to win our remaining three matches. It&rsquo;s going to be an exciting finish.&rdquo;Mosimane stressed his priorities lay with retaining both the Caf Champions League and Caf Super Cup: &ldquo;If Wits win the league, then good luck to them. They have done exceptionally well. Wits&rsquo; focus is local. They want to win the league. &ldquo;But it has not been equal &ndash; we have played 14 games more than them. Both Wits and (third placed) Cape Town City are fresh. Our international programme is important to us.&rdquo; &ldquo;My priority is international. I want to make more history for Sundowns by winning the Champions League and Super Cup again, plus playing at the Fifa Club World Cup. Wits don&rsquo;t care about the Champions League. Sundowns are a big club and have big ambitions.&rdquo;Even if Downs fail to retain the league title Mosimane won&rsquo;t be losing any sleep: &ldquo;I could never complain, as no other team in Africa has played more or done as much mileage as we have.&rdquo;Mosimane said he was happy to have key players Sibusiso Villakazi, Anele Ngcongca and Tiyani Mabunda back for the opening Champions League group stage clash with Ethiopia&rsquo;s St George in Atteridgeville on Saturday: &ldquo;This is the start of our important international programme and it&rsquo;s good to have Anele, Mabunda and Villa back. We&rsquo;ll need them for the Champions League.&rdquo;He is happy his Ivory Coast striker, Yannick Zakri, is finally settling and scoring since joining from Asec Mimosas at the start of the season.Zakri scored in Downs&rsquo; 2-0 league win over Orlando Pirates at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken Zakri time to get used to South Africa. It&rsquo;s not easy for foreign layers to settle here. He has shown the speed and aggression we saw when we bought him.&rdquo; But before the coach can plan for St George, Downs host struggling Baroka FC in a Premiership clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm).Said Brazilians midfield star Themba Zwane: &ldquo;It was important to beat Pirates and stay in the league race. Baroka will come at us. We need to take the chances we create.&rdquo;
