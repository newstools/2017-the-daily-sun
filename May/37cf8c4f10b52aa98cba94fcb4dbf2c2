BAD luck has once again visited a poor rural family whose home was ravaged by a storm. On Monday, the SunTeam reported on the Langa family from Buthulo Village in Port St Johns, Eastern Cape.The Langas were among a number of families whose houses were affected by a hailstorm last week. As the family was still coming to terms with the damage, Savuvu Langa (40) was run over by a drunk driver on Saturday morning. The next day Ntombovelo Langa (26) died after a long illness.When the SunTeam visited the family yesterday, gogo Nokusukuma Langa (61) was sitting on a mattress in one of the rondavels that were not affected by the storm, mourning her kids and bemoaning her damaged home. She received some relief when officials from Sassa and the Port St Johns Municipality gave her two new mattresses and groceries.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve suffered a lot in the past week. I&rsquo;m still struggling to come to terms with the loss of my children. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not eaten for days. I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to make it through this,&rdquo; said Nokusukuma. Not only did Gogo Nokusukuma and her family lose a number of the housing structures built on their yard, they now have to pay for funerals.The gogo&rsquo;s son Ncedisile said although his dead sister had funeral cover, the family could do with assistance in the form of groceries and clothes. &ldquo;We were struggling before the storm and now things are worse. I have to make ends meet and arrange the funeral of my brother, but I have faith that everything will work out,&rdquo; he said. Ntombovelo will be buried in two weeks&rsquo; time in Buthulo, while Savuvu&rsquo;s burial date is yet to be finalised.
