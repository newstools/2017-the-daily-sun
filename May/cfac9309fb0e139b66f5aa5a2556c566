SOUTH Africa&rsquo;s fastest man, Akani Simbine, is on track to win his first major international medal. The African sprint king has gained global renown and is expected to shine at the IAAF World Championships in London, England, in August. Simbine will do the double in the 100m and 200m events at the biggest athletics competition this season. Few would bet against the man who registered 13 sub-10 second times securing a podium finish in London. Simbine is fresh from becoming the first SA sprinter to win a 100m Diamond League Series race, clocking 9.99 sec in Doha, Qatar, two weeks ago. The 23-year-old beat a strong field including Asafa Powell of Jamaica, Justin Gatlin (Jamaica) and Olympic double bronze medallist in the 100m and 200m, Andre de Grasse of Canada, in Doha. Things are looking bright for Simbine, who became the first SA sprinter to make the Olympics 100m final when he competed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016, finishing fifth in 9.94 sec. Speaking at his send-off before travelling to the USA where he is scheduled to compete against Jamaican great Johan Blake at the Boston meet on 4 June, Simbine said he expected as many as eight medals from Team SA in London. He says two of those medals will come from him. All eyes will be on him to see how he fares at the big event in London. Simbine has a hectic schedule, which includes running against his mentor and idol Usain Bolt in Jamaica in Bolt&rsquo;s final season before hanging up his spikes. Simbine said: &ldquo;I have the confidence to beat the best in the world. I have the speed and proper training to do it. I&rsquo;m up for the double and will do my best to come back with medals.&rdquo; Before the World Champs, He will also compete in Budapest in Hungary, where he clocked 9.89 sec last year.
