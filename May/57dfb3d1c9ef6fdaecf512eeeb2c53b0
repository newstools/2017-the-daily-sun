SHE did not like the idea of her lover dumping her to marry another woman. So the jilted married woman from MK in Mangaung apparently stabbed the man with a knife. It is alleged her plan backfired &ndash; after she had stabbed him two times, he wrestled the knife from her and stabbed her dead with it on Thursday. A member of the woman&rsquo;s family told Daily Sun: &ldquo;She was married to her husband for 17 years and they had four kids.&ldquo;We urged her to stop cheating. She had been cheating with different men for a long time.&rdquo;A neighbour claimed that the woman was cheating on her husband while he was at work. Police spokeswo-man Constable Mosili Ntsika said a woman aged between 35 and 40 was stabbed dead. A 36-year-old man went to the police station to seek assistance. He was arrested and charged with murder. He will appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.
