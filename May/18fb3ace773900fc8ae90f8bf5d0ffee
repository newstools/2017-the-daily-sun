A group of angry people calling themselves Business Forum blocked and trashed streets in Tshwane today. They also blocked landfill sites in all regions of&nbsp; the City of Tshwane and disrupted waste collection services. City of Tshwane Mayor, Solly Msimanga says the Business Forum is angry because of the city&rsquo;s open tendering process that awards contracts to other qualified bidders.Top of Form The City of Tshwane ended up obtaining a court order stopping the blocking of waste management services. The municipality quickly informed the residents that everything would be back to normal and law-enforcement services would escort waste trucks to ensure continuation of waste collection. "In order to ensure transparency in acquisition of services, the current administration has aligned itself with the open tendering system. "This simply means that a service provider gets awarded a contract through a fair bidding competition. In this case the City granted a contract to a service provider that qualified whereas the forum wants its members to receive contracts without following due process." said Mayoral Committee member for Environmental Management, Michael Mkhari. The City went on to say that no forum or company will be awarded a contract outside the City&rsquo;s normal tendering method as that will be as good as favouritism, maladministration and corruption. #BusinessForum angry because of city&rsquo;s open tendering process that awarded contracts to other qualified bidders. #tshwanewaste&mdash; Solly Msimanga (@SollyMsimanga) May 5, 2017&nbsp;@CityTshwane apologises 2 road users for the mess on the city&rsquo;s roads.Waste thrashing done by members of the #BusinessForum #tshwanewaste&mdash; City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) May 5, 2017Bad confrontations le Business Men ba Maginza...
