CAPE Town City have achieved, in their first seasons in the Premier Soccer League (PSL), what many clubs can only dream about.After winning the Telkom Knockout early this season, they have now secured a place in one of the Caf competitions next year.And having Eric Tinkler in their corner will come quite handy when the Absa Premiership newcomers will navigate the demanding adventure of continental competition.The Citizens have secured a spot for next season&rsquo;s Caf Confederation Cup &ndash; but they can still get into the Caf Champions League should the current African champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, stumble in their last league game.But Tinkler&rsquo;s charges would also have to win their match against Polokwane City on Saturday.The Citizens&rsquo; chairman, John Comitis, said it&rsquo;s their responsibility to represent the country in the competition.&nbsp;Some teams have in the recent past been blasted for not taking competitions serious, others citing the costs being too much to bear.Travelling on the continent comes with long hours of flying and sitting in transit waiting for flights.Comitis said they will go into the continental competition without much expectations, but will be prepared to represent the country well.Said Comitis: &ldquo;We have the responsibility to represent South Africa in the continent.&ldquo;Sundowns have been doing well and it&rsquo;s something that has to be continued.&ldquo;We want to compete as well as we can. We will go into the competition without much expectation but we&rsquo;ll see how far we can go.&rdquo;Tinkler has unfinished business on the continent, having been in two finals but failing to come back as a champion.&nbsp;Comitis said they will be strengthening the team for the season.&nbsp;&ldquo;Eric knows the challenges there. He will be able to prepare the team for the journey. We will add value to the team and balance it.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will tweak one or two positions but keep the momentum and stability in the team,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Comitis said they had only hoped to finish in the Top 8 but the results throughout the season gave them new hopes.&nbsp;He added: &ldquo;We had planned for a top 8 position but when we started getting back-to-back results, we started believing.&nbsp;&ldquo;We still have the possibility for pushing for second spot, it&rsquo;s about sustaining and maintaining our run.&rdquo;
