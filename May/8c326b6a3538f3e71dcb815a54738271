THE taxi was not roadworthy, it did not have a licence disc and the driver did not have a public driver&rsquo;s permit. But there was one more shock for the traffic officers &ndash; the taxi&rsquo;s passengers were 26 school kids being ferried to various schools in the town, packed like sardines into the Toyota Quantum. Traffic officers in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, stopped the taxi during a routine operation along Verena Road on Friday morning and they were horrified to discover just how overloaded it was.Further inspection of the vehicle revealed yet more traffic transgressions.&ldquo;The taxi itself was not roadworthy, it had no valid licence disc and the driver had no public driver&rsquo;s permit,&rdquo; said Emalahleni municipality&rsquo;s spokesman, Kingdom Mabuza. &ldquo;We issued the driver with a fine, pulled the minibus off the road and arranged alternative transport for the children.&rdquo; Emalahleni&rsquo;s mayor, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, expressed her anger at greedy drivers who overload school children and disregard the basic rules of the road, especially in light of all the school pupils who were killed in a minibus accident just outside Bronkhorstspruit last month.The horrific accident occurred when an overloaded minibus taxi hit a truck.She cautioned parents to make sure that they examine the minibuses which transport their children to school.&ldquo;It is every parent&rsquo;s responsibility to make sure that children arrive at school safely.&ldquo;They should not allow drivers to pack their children into a vehicle which is unroadworthy and driven by a driver who is not properly licensed,&rdquo; said Ntshalintshali.
