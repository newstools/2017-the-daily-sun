THE municipality has visited the school twice with performing artists to teach kids to save water.The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro said saving water had become vital as dam levels are low.But what has stunned pupils and teachers is that the municipality still has not fixed a leaking water pipe next to their school.Pupils at Alex Jayiya Primary School in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage, have to tip-toe over slippery rocks to avoid falling in a stinking puddle that has already collected at their school gate.The water comes from a drain at the back of a house in Lupuwana Street, crossing the school.Often cows and pigs make themselves at home in the stinking water while pupils sit and cough in the classrooms.Teacher Macondor Fanayo said the problem started at the end of February.&ldquo;A team was sent by the municipality to do a stage play urging us to save water. Funny enough they performed the play, on two separate occasions, while water was running past this school. We have two reference numbers but no one has come to rescue us.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki thanked Daily Sun for having alerted them to the problem. &ldquo;We will send a team as soon as possible,&rdquo; he promised.
