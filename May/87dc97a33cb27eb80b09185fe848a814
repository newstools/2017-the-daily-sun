THE two men accused of trying to sell a human head will stand trial tomorrow. Edward Raatji (51) and Stanley Mohlake (25) were supposed to face trial yesterday.But Limpopo High Court Judge Matsoro Semenya postponed it because Raatji&rsquo;s lawyer was not present in court. The two men were bust in the Polokwane CBD in Limpopo last year, allegedly trying to sell a human head to a businessman.The head belonged to Nthabiseng Mosomane (17) of Mapela Village, outside Mokopane. After the gruesome discovery, her burnt body was found under a bridge in her village. The victim lived a few streets away from both suspects. Raatji said his lawyer was not present in court as he had initially been represented by a Legal Aid one, whom he had decided to replace with a private one. Judge Semenya asked for the private lawyer&rsquo;s contact details to confirm whether the accused had indeed hired him. Nthabiseng&rsquo;s mum Phylistus (45) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My family will only be fine and live in peace once both accused are given life sentences. &ldquo;My daughter was brutally murdered, and I want them to rot in jail.&rdquo;
