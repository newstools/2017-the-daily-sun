FORMER Bafana Bafana captain Aaron &ldquo;Mbazo&rdquo; Mokoena&rsquo;s defensive skills have been tested again.&nbsp;After losing the home game against Nedbank two months ago, Mbazo got himself another home game against the same bank.But this time, it involved another property.Mbazo was taken to court by the bank for failing to repay the bond on a piece of land at Zuurfontein Farm in Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal.According to court papers, Mbazo owes the bank more than R750&thinsp;500 for the land he bought in 2008.And when Mbazo started defaulting on his monthly instalment, he applied to sell off land in Vanderbijlpark to get back some of the money he owed the credit provider.According to court papers, the loan agreement signed by the former Blackburn Rovers star amounted to R904&thinsp;731.The bank says Mbazo had failed to pay a monthly instalment of R10&thinsp;984,56 since 1 August.The bank claimed it had tried everything to get him to pay arrears and the outstanding balance.Nedbank manager in the home loan department, Bongani Gonyela, stated in the affidavit they&rsquo;d sent many letters of demand, but they were ignored.Gonyela said: &ldquo;The respondent acknowledged their indebtedness to the applicant is the total sum of R520&thinsp;000.&rdquo;He further said Mbazo was R46&thinsp;476 in arrears when the service provider started pursuing him from August last year.&ldquo;Despite the demand, the respondents failed and/or refused and/or neglected to pay the said sum or any part thereof to the applicant,&rdquo; the bank said in a statement.Last month, Sunday Sun reported that the bank took Mbazo and his wife, Anastacia Lerato Mokoena, to court for failure to repay their bond.Just as it had happened last month, Mbazo and Anastacia, were cited as first and second respondent in the case.According to court documents, the two are married in community of property.According to Gonyela&rsquo;s affidavit, the two acknowledged owing the bank, but still failed to make payment arrangements. The bank asked the court to rule that the land be repossessed and sold in an auction to recoup the money. The bank also requested a default judgment against the couple.South Gauteng High Court Judge Mashile ordered Mbazo to pay, with added interest at 13,55%. The bank&rsquo;s papers state that it has tried to get Mbazo to pay or make an arrangement since August, but to no avail.In 2013, it was reported that Mbazo lost his 2005 BMW X5 to the repo man. He had bought the car through BMW&rsquo;s financial services for R590&thinsp;766 in March 2008, with monthly instalments of R8&thinsp;157.But he defaulted, and was R47&thinsp;770 in arrears, and the total balance owing added up to R193&thinsp;007.Mbazo refused to comment on the matter.And Anastacia could not be reached for comment.
