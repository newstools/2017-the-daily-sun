SOUL singer Kabomo Vilakazi had no home.&nbsp; He and Palesa Mashiyane checked into a luxury hotel . . .&nbsp; THEY RAN UP A HUGE BILL AND SNUCK OUT!&nbsp; The total cost of their stay was R24&thinsp;152. And now cops are hunting Kabomo for fraud.&nbsp; When the two checked into The Hamilton in Sandton, Jozi, they allegedldy had no home of their own. According to papers in Sunday Sun&rsquo;s possession, Kabomo and Palesa spent eight days at the hotel in July last year.&nbsp;During their stay, they ran up a R7&thinsp;000 bill for food and drinks alone. An invoice lists lamb, beef, chicken and fish. The penniless pair drank cider, beer, whisky and vodka.&nbsp; Sunday Sun can reveal that hotel owner Gail Hamilton-Brown made several attempts to get the bill settled.&nbsp;The SunTeam has seen email exchanges between the pair and thehotelier. Gail pleaded with them to settle their bill. Kabomo and Palesa acknowledged the debt and promised to pay. Gail even offered to let them pay in instalments, but they insisted they would pay a lump sum.&nbsp; After months of pleading, they managed to pay R11&thinsp;000, leaving an outstanding balance of R13&thinsp;152.&nbsp; In one email, Palesa wrote: &ldquo;Things got increasingly difficult since we were there . . . It&rsquo;s been difficult to raise R14K. Kabomo has taken extra work and I&rsquo;ve done the same to get money.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the papers seen by the SunTeam, Gail gave them more time to pay. But her patience finally ran out, and she headed for the Parkview Police Station on Wednesday, to open a fraud case. The legal term is &ldquo;bilking&rdquo;, which means deliberately failing to pay a bill.&nbsp; Sunday Sun sources claim The Hamilton is not the only hotel these two owe.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been drifting around from one B&amp;B to another. I&rsquo;m not sure why, because Kabomo makes money working as an artist,&rdquo; said one source.&nbsp; According to another source, Gail has been calling Palesa as Kabomo had blocked her calls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Palesa is hiding Kabomo&rsquo;s whereabouts &ndash; and look where that&rsquo;s got them now!&rdquo;&nbsp; As soon as Gail had opened the case, police started tracing Kabomo.&nbsp; When called for comment Palesa, who was with Kabomo, refused to comment and passed the phone to Kabomo, who said he wasn&rsquo;t going to comment.&nbsp; Parkview cops confirmed they were investigating a case of fraud (Bilking) against the pair, and no arrests had been made. Yesterday, Gail refused to comment, saying she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about the matter.
