THEY were once Mzansi&rsquo;s hottest young couple, but rumour has it Ntando Duma and DJ Junior Da Rocka&rsquo;s love boat is sinking fast and furious.&nbsp; According to insiders, the Gagasi FM DJ (real name Junior Mzizi) has been two-timing a very preggies Ntando.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it gets juicier,&rdquo; the source said, adding that the lovers were living apart, and that Junior had gone back to his ex-girlfriend, Lihle Bhengu.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rumour started when Junior and Lihle posted pictures on social media platform Instagram.&nbsp; &ldquo;And although posted separately, the pics suggested the two were at the same place. And this was fuelled by Junior&rsquo;s post having a &lsquo;Thank You Baby&rsquo; caption, accompanied by a heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both Ntando and Junior refused to comment, but the sources had a lot to say. &ldquo;We were shocked when Junior showed up at his surprise party with Lihle,&rdquo; said the mole. &ldquo;Turns out Ntando, who was in Durban, may have known about their affair. Anyhow, she didn&rsquo;t attend the celebration or wish him a happy birthday. Instead, she used their unborn baby&rsquo;s Instagram account to wish him a happy birthday.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the message, she made it look like it was the baby wishing their dad a happy birthday. His response was a mere &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to a second mole, Ntando and the DJ had even stopped posting pictures of them together since the pregnancy, and the mother-to-be had recently been spending most of her time at home.&nbsp; &ldquo;They used to be inseparable. But now they&rsquo;re just cold toward each other, and it becomes apparent they&rsquo;re doing their own thing,&rdquo; the source claimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ntando&rsquo;s been focusing on her career. She&rsquo;s appeared in interviews, saying she was married to her dreams and pregnant by her passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember, Ntando and Junior were planning to get married. But now that dream is fading fast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ntando had admitted on Metro FM&rsquo;s Fresh Breakfast show that she was pregnant, saying she broke her virginity the day after her umemulo (a coming of age ceremony). Lihle was not available for comment. And despite attempts to reach her via SMS, she hadn&rsquo;t responded at the time of going to print.
