RESIDENTS said evil wild animals have been sneaking into their kasi every night to chew cow bones left scattered in a backyard kraal! They fear their dogs&rsquo; lives are in danger, as an innocent dog nicknamed Wrong Turn was left with a gaping wound on the side of its muzzle when an unidentified creature gave it a hot klap. The poor dog lives a painful life as the wound has left its gums and teeth exposed.Wrong Turn was apparently fighting with a creature over the bones when it was attacked. The incident happened at a kraal belonging to the Njanjala family from KwaNobuhle.Thembisile Njanjala (62) said they slaughtered a cow over the weekend to honour their dead uncle, Libele.&ldquo;According to tradition, we are not allowed to burn these bones. They have to be left in the kraal and dogs often come and eat them.&rdquo; Thembisile said he believed the bones had attracted wild creatures. &ldquo;One night we heard one of the dogs groaning in pain and the others were chasing something with heavy footsteps. The next day the neighbour&rsquo;s dog had no cheek!&rdquo;The dog&rsquo;s owner, Mazwi Mbewu (63), said the poor animal was struggling to eat and was in pain. SPCA officials took Wrong Turn away. &ldquo;We will give you a report as soon as possible,&rdquo; said inspector Mariaan Wentzel.
