FOR months cops had been struggling to work out who was stealing cattle in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. Not once did it cross their minds that the cheap meat sold at the popular Posh&rsquo;s Place could be stolen.After all, the shisa nyama was a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the police station and some of the cops were allegedly regulars there. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said an increase in complaints of stock theft led to a door-to-door raid of shisa nyamas in the area.&ldquo;We had several stock theft complaints in the Rocklands area. Three weeks ago we received another about seven stolen cows,&rdquo; she said.On Tuesday their investigations led to Posh&rsquo;s Place in KwaNobuhle. Upon searching the place, they recovered raw meat from four of the seven stolen cows. It was being stored under a bed. Additional information led police to the crossroads behind the multi-purpose sports ground and Qukushe bush. &ldquo;This is where the cows were being slaughtered. &ldquo;We found the other three alive. Two farmers identified their cows.&rdquo;A patron told the People&rsquo;s Paper that they no longer buy meat at a butchery. The stolen meat was being sold as delicious umxhaxho and qadidi at R20 a plate. &ldquo;The meat here is fresher, cheaper and more delicious. Everyone ekasi was crazy about it. Even cops in uniform came here for a delicious plate of meat.&ldquo;I never thought it was stolen because the shisa nyama is close to the cop shop.&rdquo;Farmer Zongezile &ldquo;Mvala&rdquo; Stokwe was reduced to tears when he saw his cows. &ldquo;I lost two pregnant cows. But I thank God the police managed to recover another three of them. These are ruthless thieves. &ldquo;They killed my pregnant cows with pangas. The unborn calves were everywhere,&rdquo; he said.Police have arrested a co-owner of the tavern and four other men.They will appear in court on Friday for stock theft.Swart said: &ldquo;I cannot deny or confirm that cops were buying meat there.&rdquo;
