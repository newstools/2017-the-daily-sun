NEW SPORT minister Thulas Nxesi has jumped on the back of a bandwagon without being sure where it is heading.Just this week Safa and two PSL clubs &ndash; SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits &ndash; were at loggerheads regarding the release of players for the 2017 Fifa Under-20 World Cup in South Korea.Amajita coach Thabo Senong included star players from Wits &ndash; Phakamani Mahlambi and Reeve Frosler &ndash; and Tebogo Mokoena from SuperSport.But with these two clubs having a lot to play for in the PSL, they asked for their players to be excused from the tournament. Safa, however, exerted pressure by putting its foot down and quoting unheard-of Fifa laws while threatening to ban the players and the clubs.Nxesi released a statement yesterday, which reads: &ldquo;The unfortunate and current standoff between Safa and some PSL clubs regarding their refusal to release players to perform national duty has been brought to my attention. &ldquo;This is a serious matter, as it denies our U-20 squad the muscle to go give their best at the upcoming World Cup,&rdquo; Nxesi said.&ldquo;It also denies young players valuable international experience and the pride of representing their country.&rdquo;Safa approached the ministry of sport and recreation to assist in finding a permanent solution to this problem, which continues to affect all national football teams when it comes to international competitions. &ldquo;Our national teams end up not being a true reflection of the coach&rsquo;s first choice, adversely impacting on the performance of the team,&rdquo; Nxesi said in the statement. He continued: &ldquo;Safa failed on a number of occasions to strike a compromise with PSL, therefore leading to the current impasse. &ldquo;Safa has therefore requested that I investigate what legislative options exist to ensure that our country is represented by our best available talent.&rdquo;The minister urged all the parties to find a solution in the short-term, one which prioritises national teams &ldquo;but which may allow for flexibility in very special circumstances &ndash; something which could even form the basis of a binding Memorandum of Agreement&rdquo;.
