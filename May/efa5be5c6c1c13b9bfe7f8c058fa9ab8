DEPUTY president Cyril Ramaphosa&rsquo;s campaign to be named ANC president at the party&rsquo;s December elective conference was given a boost over the weekend when he was endorsed by the Northern Cape ANC. During the provincial elective conference on Saturday the party resolved to back Ramaphosa when the party&rsquo;s succession debate opens. ANC alliance partner Sanco also endorsed him as successor to President Jacob Zuma. On Saturday night Ramaphosa attended KZN Sadtu&rsquo;s gala dinner. His support has been growing in KZN, a province seen as backing his rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The province sends the biggest delegations to the elective conference and will play a key role in electing the next party president. When Ramaphosa addressed the Northern Cape conference on Friday, he said: &ldquo;We do not want leaders who are arrogant.&ldquo;We do not want leaders who do not take advice.&rdquo; The provincial slate aligned to Ramaphosa was victorious after the pro-Zuma faction declined nomination when it became clear they were facing defeat.Newly elected Northern Cape ANC chairman Zamani Saul said as the province prepares for the December conference they must start preparing Ramaphosa to take over. Premier Sylvia Lucas, who is aligned to Zuma, has threatened to take the decision to the ANC&rsquo;s national executive committee for review. She claimed there had been many irregularities.
