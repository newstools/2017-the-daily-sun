ZWELINZIMA Vavi said he feels sorry for those who are still yearning for the old ANC.He said they must forget about it because they will never win the ANC back to the Freedom Charter.&ldquo;Those who have money have captured the ANC. The pro-poor, pro-worker ANC is gone,&rdquo; the general secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions told the media yesterday in Joburg.&ldquo;I was a very loyal member of the ANC but we have lost that battle.&rdquo; Vavi was flanked by leaders of the newly formed federation to report back after the first meeting of the national executive committee. He said they will not make the mistake of forming any political alliance as no political party speaks about the issues that affect workers, like poverty and unemployment. He said they want to recruit one million members by the end of the year and grow by a million members every year.He said they have noted attempts to frustrate the federation, with the department of labour preventing new unions from joining the federation.He called on decisive action to end violence directed at women and children. &ldquo;This violence will only be defeated when we succeed in removing the colonial, apartheid and capitalist exploitation that has destroyed the value-based system of a normal society.&rdquo; He said his federation was opposed to the ongoing corruption, looting and mismanagement in state-owned enterprises. He vowed that unions belonging to the federation would go all out to protect their members from exploitation.Vavi said the federation will look at launching its own radio or TV station and will produce a digital and printed newsletter.
