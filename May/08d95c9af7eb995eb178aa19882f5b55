&ldquo;SOMETHING happened, but it is not serious.&rdquo; This is what a teacher allegedly told a mum after her daughter came home with a nasty scratch and bruise on her cheek.Speaking on behalf of the girl&rsquo;s family, relative Zukiswa Ngcwangu (35) said the child&rsquo;s mum received a call from the teacher at Linge Junior Secondary School in Nyanga East, Cape Town, last Friday asking to meet with her. &ldquo;The teacher wanted to talk to her because her child had been injured, but when she arrived the teacher was nowhere to be seen,&rdquo; said Zukiswa. &ldquo;The mum was shocked when she saw her eight-year-old daughter had red marks on her face. &ldquo;The teacher had beat and scarred the child with an A4 counter book in front of the entire class.&rdquo;Zukiswa said the mum later received an SMS from the teacher in which she apologised.The teacher said she had just &ldquo;lost it&rdquo;. When the SunTeam asked the grade 1 pupil what had happened, she said her teacher beat her with the book because she had not finished her work on time in class. Principal Xoliswa Ngongota said she had referred the matter to the education department.Western Cape education department spokeswoman Jessica Shelver said: &ldquo;&ldquo;The case has been referred to the labour relations department for investigation.&rdquo;
