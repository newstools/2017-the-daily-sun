WHEN the family moved into their new house, Ronnie Morakile thought the move would bring him joy.But the 48-year-old from Phameng in Mangaung said his wife suddenly fell ill and died.&ldquo;For the pastt seven years, our lives have become a living hell,&rdquo; he said. Ronnie said they are being terrorised by a monster with big feet! They have visited many sangomas and prophets but it hasn&rsquo;t helped. &ldquo;My problems started a week after moving into our new home with my wife and three kids.&ldquo;We heard footsteps running up and down on the roof, and my wife became sick. &ldquo;She complained that something was moving in her body, and she died a year later,&rdquo; he said.Ronnie said he is now experiencing the same symptoms and doctors can&rsquo;t work out what is wrong.&ldquo;When I get home I feel something moving in my stomach and doctors can&rsquo;t find anything wrong with me.&ldquo;A sangoma came to my house and dug up muthi but still nothing has come right. &ldquo;The sangoma said some jealous rival who wants to see me dead has sent a tokoloshe to my house.&rdquo;He said the muthi is gone but the problem hasn&rsquo;t stopped.&ldquo;I have spent a lot of money on sangomas and prophets.&ldquo;Things go missing from the house. When I drive I have blackouts and have been involved in accidents.&rdquo;He said he knows there is someone in SunLand who can help him.Sangoma Kingsley Maboe said: &ldquo;Ronnie&rsquo;s family is cursed. They need a strong sangoma to destroy the tokoloshe and his house needs to be cleansed with strong muthi.&rdquo;
