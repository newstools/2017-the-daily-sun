ANC MPs will be expected to vote in line with the decision of the ANC caucus on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe today said the party's NEC had agreed this weekend that ANC MPs would be in violation of the party's constitution if they voted against the caucus' decision."On the motion of no confidence against the president proposed in Parliament, the NEC reaffirmed its confidence in comrades deployed as Members of Parliament, trusting that they would continue to conduct themselves in line with the constitution, prescripts and norms of the ANC," Mantashe told the media in Joburg.The party defined an act of misconduct as acting on behalf of or in collaboration with counter-revolutionary forces, a political organisation or party other than an organisation or party in alliance with the ANC, and in a manner contrary to the aims, policies and objectives of the ANC.ANC stalwarts, however, today called for a new strategy by the party's caucus regarding the DA-sponsored motion of no confidence against Zuma.It called on the ANC caucus to move its own motion of no confidence against Zuma."If the opposition truly held the interests of the country at heart, as they publicly state, they would withdraw the motion of no confidence and allow members of the ANC caucus to uphold the Constitution of the country and show the necessary leadership that the country expects by formally moving a motion of no confidence themselves," the stalwarts said in a statement."The country will now look to parliamentarians to protect our fellow citizens. As stalwarts who were part of the struggle for a constitutional, democratic South Africa, we call on all Members of Parliament to reflect carefully on the way forward."&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-mps-must-vote-in-line-with-caucus-nec-20170529
