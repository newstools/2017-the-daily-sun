TSHWANE Police Training College instructor Gift Kelehe says he is ready to put his body to the test on Sunday as he attempts to defend his Comrades Marathon up run crown. The 35-year-old Mafikeng-born ultra-marathon runner will line up against a quality field of 20 000 athletes in four days&rsquo; time as they set off on the 89km up run from Durban to Pietermaritzburg this weekend.Kelehe, who won the race in 2015 in 5:38:36, is currently in camp in Dullstroom, Mpumalanga, with his Tom-Tom Athletics Club teammates.He plans to use last year&rsquo;s down run winner and fellow-kasi boy David Gatebe as pacesetter, along with Surprise Makofane and Gordon Lesetedi who will be backing him throughout the race.Gatebe is the current down run record holder. He set the record of 5:18:19 last year.Kelehe believes the weather and mountains of Mpumalanga are tailor-made for training for such events and will help him build the muscle strength he will need to win the uprun ultra-marathon.&ldquo;And my training partners are just what the doctor ordered,&rdquo; said the soft-spoken Kelehe, vowing to win the race again.&ldquo;It has to happen. But I am under no pressure from anyone,&rdquo; he stressed.&ldquo;I am going to Durban to run my own race, not to focus on opponents. My preparations have been going extremely well &ndash; I am just waiting for race day to arrive.&rdquo;He will fly down to KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday to have ample time to acclimatise to the Durban weather and relax before Sunday, when top runners from across the world will line up for the race.Kelehe&rsquo;s strategy is to run in the company of Gatebe for the first 80km. They plan to break off in the last 10km and will start pushing for the finish line as they try to breast the winners&rsquo; tape first.But they will face stiff competition from Nedbank Club runners such as Zimbabwean duo Claude Mushiywa and Mike Fokoroni and Soshanguve-born Ludwick Mamabolo, who will all be lining up for the race too.They will also need to keep a lookout for the dark horse, Austrian Vladimir Shatrov.The up run record of 5:24:49 was set by Leonid Shvetsov of Russia in 2008.
