UZALO actress, Nompilo Maphumulo, is said to be stuck at a transit camp.&nbsp; This because her application for an RDP house was turned down.&nbsp; Nompilo plays Nosipho Xulu, the daughter of Muzi Xulu in the SABC1 telenova.&nbsp; Her family and a neighbour were left behind at the transit camp.&nbsp; According to moles close to the situation, last December Nompilo was refused ownership of an RDP house in Cornorbia because she apparently earns a living as an actress.&nbsp; This despite the fact that she had applied for the house seven years ago.&nbsp; Said the source: &ldquo;Back then, she qualified for an RDP, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s got money now that she&rsquo;s in Uzalo.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the source, Nompilo is not permanently employed and her contract could be terminated any moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;She qualified, and she and her family were moved to a transit camp in Newlands outside Durban,&rdquo; said another source.&nbsp; According to sources, Nompilo applied for an RDP before she landed a role in Uzalo.&nbsp; When called for a comment, an angry Nompilo asked the SunTeam: &ldquo;Who told you that? What are you trying to achieve?&nbsp; I was the one who was staying at transit camps. &ldquo;For you to ask me about where I&rsquo;m staying, I think that&rsquo;s private and prefer to keep it that way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go back to your source and tell him or her to tell you everything because it seems your source knows so much.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nompilo&rsquo;s aunt Sthembile Maphumulo confirmed that they were still staying at a transit camp.&nbsp; Sthembile said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful for us to be sidelined like this because my nephew is seen on TV. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Nompilo is not permanent in Uzalo.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nompilo has been staying there alone for five months. They found out that she&rsquo;s an actress and didn&rsquo;t give her a house,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all alone now. People were moved out of the camp before December last year, and only two households were left behind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thieves will think she has money since she&rsquo;s always appearing in Uzalo.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another source claimed Nompilo and her family had been living in transit camps for seven years, hoping they would be allocated a house in Cornorbia.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good for Nompilo&rsquo;s reputation as an actress who has just found her feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Housing Department was unfair to Nompilo and her family. That might force her to go and look for a job, maybe in Joburg,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp; For the municipality to neglect us like this after waiting for seven years is unfair. &ldquo;We were on the list and all of my neighbours have since been moved to stay at Cornorbia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gugu Zulu, who is a ward councillor in the area, on Friday requested the SunTeam to send her an email, but hadn&rsquo;t responded to our questions at the time of going to press.
