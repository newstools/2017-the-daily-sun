WHENEVER the house of God filled up with congregants beginning their praise and worship, residents nearby felt like crying.But now it is the residents who can rejoice.The court has told the church to shut its doors, take its speakers and go!Residents of Yeoville said they were delighted with the South Gauteng High Court&rsquo;s decision on Wednesday ordering Selvan Marcelle, also known as pastor Elijah Tenkwee, to stop operating his church illegally.Resident Tebogo Mohlala (46) said he has lived in the area for almost 20 years and that the church almost made him sell his house and move to find peace.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy with the ruling. We can finally sleep in peace!&rdquo;Tebogo said his kids struggled to study properly and would also lose sleep due to the ear-splitting noise caused by the churchgoers.&ldquo;They used to put big loud speakers outside. &ldquo;It was happening even during weekdays.&rdquo; Martha Nkabinde (34) said she would like to thank Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba for taking the church and the pastor to court.&ldquo;We love God and praying, but we were not receiving God&rsquo;s blessing, but hell. &ldquo;We were in hell,&rdquo; said Martha.She said other church leaders should heed the lesson and respect residents and people of other beliefs.Mashaba said that if Marcella failed to comply with the court&rsquo;s order within 30 days, the sheriff of the court would enforce the order and evict the church.He said the city believed in promoting and protecting the religious practices of all residents, but that it couldn&rsquo;t come at the expense of the rule of law. He said the church contravened city by-laws relating to building and land use. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s court ruling is a victory for the community of Yeoville and the rule of law,&rdquo; said Mashaba.
