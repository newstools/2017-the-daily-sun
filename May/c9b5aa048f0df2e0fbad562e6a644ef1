The truck driver was apparently on his way to Ladybrand when he lost control. He died in the accident. Topollo Monosi (45) from Marseilles farm told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I was riding on my horse to Clocolan when I stopped next to the road to pee. &ldquo;Before I could get back on my horse to continue my journey, I saw a truck changing lanes. &ldquo;The next thing I knew the truck left the road and overturned. Many packets containing chicken were scattered all over. &ldquo;I was afraid to go near the truck because I thought that it might explode, so I waited. &ldquo;Eventually, paramedics came to the scene and tried to save the driver. &ldquo;People who live nearby helped themselves to the chicken and did not bother pulling the driver out of the truck. &ldquo;The police finally arrived and stopped the people from emptying the truck. I was worried about the man who died. &ldquo;His family will be shocked that their loved one is gone. I really think truck drivers should rest if they feel tired.&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Phumelelo Dhlamini confirmed that an accident did take place on the R26 road.&ldquo;The driver lost control of the truck. A case has been opened and cops are investigating,&rdquo; he said.
