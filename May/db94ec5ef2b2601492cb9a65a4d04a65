KASI women are demanding that their right to sexual privacy be respected.Women from Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, claim that RDP houses are too small to poke in and they are being deprived of privacy.The women joined other residents in allocating land for themselves by marking their shack sites with white stones in Motherwell NU11, 12 and 13. &ldquo;We live in very small RDP houses with our kids who should have their own RDPs,&rdquo; Vuyiseka Dyalivane (59) told Daily Sun.&ldquo;When we want to poke we have to stand in line. First we wait for them to have sex with their girlfriends in front of us, then we make love while they are watching.&rdquo;She said she joined the land invasion to get sites for her two kids.Widow Nomvuyo Nqono (33) said: &ldquo;I share a small backyard room with my brother. I do not feel comfortable there. No boyfriend wants to visit me!&rdquo;She said she registered for an RDP house in 2015 and had not heard anything. Nompumelelo Salaze (62) said that her RDP was approved in her name, but the house was built in another person&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I am told the house does not belong to me, but I am asked to pay for services.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they condemn illegal occupation of land. &ldquo;The municipality depends on provincial and national departments of Human Settlements for funding. A new housing subsidy has been allocated to the Housing Agency.&rdquo;
