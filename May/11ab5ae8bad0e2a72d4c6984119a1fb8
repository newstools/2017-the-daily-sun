KWALANGA residents are sick and tired of poverty!Yesterday gatvol Uitenhage residents took to the streets, chanting that poverty must go away. They marched from the kasi singing freedom songs all the way to the Uitenhage CBD.The residents cited lack of land, rife poverty and the increasing number of unemployed youth as some of their greatest challenges. They gathered outside mayor Athol Trollip&rsquo;s satellite office in the town hall waiting for an official to take their 48-hour petition.They shouted: &ldquo;Hell will break loose!&rdquo;Protest leader Mgcini Mejane told the crowd: &ldquo;Even if they bring soldiers, we don&rsquo;t care. We will march.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need permission to march because it is we who feel the pain.&rdquo;He told the crowd the official had told him he was running about 15 minutes late. &ldquo;If this was a business meeting he would have been here five minutes before,&rdquo; he said.Mgcini condemned the recent shooting of 11 cows in Kruisrivier by a farmer. He said: &ldquo;The message we are getting from mlungus is that we must keep our cows away. &ldquo;There are more than 19 farms in Rocklands leased by white farmers for 20 years at R25 a month, whereas we rent backyard shacks for R300 and R600 per month. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t give us the land we will create our own township by grabbing the land near the Springs Resort.&rdquo;He said in ward 49 there has not been a house built since 1994. The petition was accepted by Selwyn Willis from the mayor&rsquo;s office. He promised to convey the message from the protesters.
