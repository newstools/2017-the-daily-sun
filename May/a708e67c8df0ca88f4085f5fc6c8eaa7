VINCENT Ngwenya wakes up with a start each time he hears the whirring sound of a car. In the morning, he thanks God for sparing his life . . . Cars have rammed into his one-roomed RDP no less than five times in the past five years! The 45-year-old man from Richmond Farm, north of Durban, said although he escaped unharmed each time, he is afraid that a car will one day crush him to death. The last time a driver lost control and crashed his car into Vincent&rsquo;s house was in December last year. &ldquo;I was asleep. Fortunately, I didn&rsquo;t get injured. During previous incidents I was awake and was able to get out of the way.&rdquo; The driver during the last accident agreed to fix the house but didn&rsquo;t pay for destroyed furniture. &ldquo;Some of the drivers promised to fix my house but never returned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one has died during these accidents. The drivers sustained minor injuries.&rdquo;Vincent&rsquo;s house is at the bottom of a hill, and speeding cars&rsquo; brakes sometimes fail when they get to the intersection. His house now has leaks and the walls are cracking.&ldquo;I would sleep peacefully again if the eThekwini Municipality installed guard rails next to the road. Right now the sound of speeding cars scares me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The house was left unoccupied when my grandfather died seven years ago. I live here because I&rsquo;m afraid that thugs might invade it.&rdquo; Councillor Nokufika Biyela said the family hadn&rsquo;t reported the matter to her.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange that guard rails be installed. I&rsquo;ll also have a look at the road,&rdquo; she said.Municipal spokesman Mandla Nsele asked for the family&rsquo;s address and phone number so that the matter could be investigated.
