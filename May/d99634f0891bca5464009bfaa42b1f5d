His brother Thembokwakhe (40) told Daily Sun that Bhekumuzi had gone out to help his friend as he was known in the area to be a strong swimmer and often helped kids cross the river. “His friend called him on Sunday when he realised he might have trouble crossing the river on his way home from work,” said Thembokwakhe. Apparently, it had been raining very heavily. “Bhekumuzi rushed to the river to help his friend,” said Thembokwakhe. “But unfortunately he went under water and was never seen again. “When the police couldn’t find him on Monday, we lost hope.“Many people have drowned while trying to cross that river.”Provincial police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, said: “The police search-and-rescue team is still searching for Bhekumuzi.” Meanwhile, SA Weather Service forecaster Julius Mahlangu predicted that most parts of the province would not experience any rain for the next week.However, Newcastle was likely to experience some showers, said Mahlangu.
