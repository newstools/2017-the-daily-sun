&ldquo;MOVE and take your son with you, or face our wrath!&rdquo; This is the message residents of A section in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, had for the mum of an alleged killer.Her son had earlier been arrested for allegedly killing another resident of the area, but was released on bail. Residents claimed the accused had been intimidating them at shebeens and in the street. They gathered in Manyanani Park on Saturday afternoon to find a way to get the accused out of their community. Zameka Stofela (33) said: &ldquo;This boy must leave our community. We are not safe at all. He harasses people at taverns and shebeens and takes their beers.&rdquo;Sanco and CPF secretary Lusanda Jonas said every year a number of people in A section were killed by fellow residents. &ldquo;It is enough now! People who do not know how to live with other people must leave,&rdquo; she said. Police officers from Lingelethu Police Station addressed residents and told them not to attack the accused or take the law into their own hands. Lieutenant-Colonel Sandile Mbesi said: &ldquo;The murder case is still in the hands of the court, so let the law take its course. &ldquo;Of course it is up to the community members if people want him to leave, but it should be done in a lawful manner.&rdquo; Residents agreed to march to the house of the accused to speak to his mum, but she was not at home when they arrived singing and shouting. The younger brother of the accused told the crowd his mother had gone to hospital. Community leader Xolela Mzongozi then told the crowd: &ldquo;We will return on Wednesday to deliver our message to the mum in a peaceful way.&rdquo;
