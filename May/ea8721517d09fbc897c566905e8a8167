THE new Mrs Shivambu has slammed her haters, who have labelled her an &ldquo;ANC bride&rdquo;.&nbsp;Last week, reports suggested that she was a card-carrying ANC member.In a statement to the People&rsquo;s Paper, Sihle &ndash;&ensp;as she is known to her friends &ndash; said: &ldquo;Let me set the record straight. I don&rsquo;t work for the political office.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is important to clarify that I am not an ANC member &ndash;&ensp;or a member of any other political organisation.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is why the fake news about my membership is so alarming. It is based on an desire to create division and confusion.&nbsp;&ldquo;The rumour is perhaps generated from the fact that I work in the Speaker&rsquo;s Office in Parliament.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t work in (Baleka) Mbete&rsquo;s political office. I work for Parliament.&nbsp;&ldquo;As an official, I&rsquo;m obligated to remain non-partisan and provide unbiased legal advice.&nbsp;&ldquo;I am a professional, a UCT B.Sc and LLB graduate.&nbsp;&ldquo;I serve with integrity and am not a member of any political organisation.&ldquo;Politics has nothing to do with our marriage,&rdquo; said Mrs Shivambu.&nbsp;In support of his bride, EFF stalwart Floyd said: &ldquo;The central issue here is that she&rsquo;s not a member of the ANC.&nbsp;&ldquo;She got her legal adviser job on merit.&rdquo;Last week, the SunTeam asked ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa about Sihle&rsquo;s ANC status.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;We have no records of her as a card carrying member.&ldquo;But love has no boundaries. Let&rsquo;s take politics out of their relationship and congratulate them on their marriage.&rdquo;Moloto Mothapo, speaking on behalf of Parliament, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The staffer in question is not designated to the private office of the Speaker.&nbsp;&ldquo;She is part of the general parliamentary support services.&nbsp;&ldquo;Further, it must be emphasised that trust relationships between Parliament, as an employer, and employees is not based on marital statuses or political affiliations &ndash;&ensp;but on relevant policies and legislative framework.&rdquo;
