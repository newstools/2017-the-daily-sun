Oskido is under investigation by the SABC.Because the Metro FM DJ has a big hit . . .&nbsp;AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY IT&rsquo;S SO POPULAR!&nbsp;Kalawa Jazmee Records guru and Metro FM DJ, Oskido (real name&nbsp;Oscar Mdlongwa) is rumoured to be in the hot seat at the broadcaster.Today, Sunday Sun can reveal that his latest hit song, AmaGrootman, is being investigated &ndash;&ensp;because&nbsp;some claim it&rsquo;s been getting too much airplay on all SABC radio stations!The SunTeam has learnt that internal auditors are visiting SABC&nbsp;provincial offices around the country &ndash; and talking to compilers.But the SunTeam couldn&rsquo;t find one source to back up the rumours.&nbsp;A source in the SABC corridors said: &ldquo;Oskido is being targeted. What I find puzzling is that they were keeping it a secret &ndash;&ensp;and now he knows what&rsquo;s going on.&ldquo;Auditors are zig-zagging the country, asking compilers why AmaGrootman is getting much more airplay than other songs.&nbsp;&ldquo;Of all the artists who could pay for a song to get an unnatural boost, why only Oskido?&rdquo;&nbsp;Another insider said: &ldquo;Oskido&rsquo;s marketing campaign has made some people angry &ndash;&ensp;and it looks like they have complained to the big bosses.&nbsp;&ldquo;The song is charting on all radio stations. And it&rsquo;s up to individual radio stations to play AmaGrootman or not. He&rsquo;s a lucky man because all radio stations love it.&rdquo;According to another source, a DJ who refused to be named: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just haters! Cassper was on the breakfast show with DJ Fresh this week, promoting his new song. They should also investigate him.&nbsp;&ldquo;We must give 90% to local content. The SABC wants us to play local music, and when we do, we are investigated. That&rsquo;s unfair!&rdquo;Yesterday, Oskido refused to comment. He referred the People&rsquo;s Paper to Universal Records&rsquo; local music director, Dharam Sewraj, who said: &ldquo;We sampled all stations for radio release equally. It was not only the SABC.SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aware of such an investigation. But generally, we don&rsquo;t talk about investigations &ndash; because they are confidential.&rdquo;
