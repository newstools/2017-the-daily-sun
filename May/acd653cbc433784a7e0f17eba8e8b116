NOMHLE Punguzwa&rsquo;s dog was very popular ekasi, but little did she know that her neighbour had evil thoughts about her pet. On Saturday morning, the 37-year-old from Joe Slovo in Port Elizabeth was horrified when her pregnant dog was allegedly raped! She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;At 7am, a neighbour woke me up after seeing my neighbour taking my dog into his house.&rdquo; Nomhle said she rushed to the house fearing the suspect was going to kill her pet. &ldquo;We knocked at his door but he didn&rsquo;t open. We waited for over 30 minutes before I went to fetch my uncle. Soon other neighbours were also on the scene,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We entered his house and I saw my dog escaping through the fence. Her privates were bleeding and she was crying in pain. We decided to call the cops.&rdquo; When police arrived with the SPCA, they found blood stains on the floor and arrested the neighbour. &ldquo;The SPCA took my dog for treatment and confiscated his own dog.&rdquo; Nomhle said the man destroyed the love she had for her dog. &ldquo;She was like my baby. People adored her. She was pregnant when this evil man raped her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope the SPCA keeps my dog because I&rsquo;m traumatised. I can&rsquo;t live with her anymore because I constantly will be reminded of what happened to her.&rdquo;The suspect was taken to Kwadwesi Police Station. At the time of going to print, the officers&rsquo; phones were switched off.
