HE WAS a trusted member of the church for years but now it seems he only wanted to enrich himself. A 38-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday after allegedly hacking into his church&rsquo;s bank account and stealing R1,6 million! He was bust by the Hawks in Mokopane, Limpopo and appeared in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on Friday. The suspect was taken into custody after a huge amount of money disappeared from the church bank account, leaving the church broke. The case was opened at the Mokopane Police Station and later transferred to the Pretoria court. The suspect will make his second court appearance today and will be joined by his girlfriend, who is believed to have helped him drain the church account. Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said: &ldquo;Both suspects are expected to appear again today for a formal bail application.&rdquo;
