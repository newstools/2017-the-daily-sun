THERE was chaos and confusion when the people went to see the mayor &ndash; but ended up holding him hostage instead!Apparently about 32 people went to meet Ditsobotla mayor Daniel Buthelezi to discuss his plans for Phola township.They allegedly wanted their projects on top of the list. But at about 4.30pm on Wednesday, things turned ugly. Armed with knives, the group allegedly disarmed the mayor&rsquo;s bodyguard and held him and the mayor hostage. They then set the inside of the local municipality&rsquo;s offices in Lichtenburg, North West on fire.They threatened to die along with the mayor. Firefighters quickly stopped the fire. Cops were called to negotiate with the hostage takers and the drama ended at 1am yesterday. No one was harmed, but the people in the group were arrested and taken to the police cells.According to provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane, residents demanded transport from police negotiators.&ldquo;They were immediately arrested and face charges of kidnapping, attempted murder and arson. &ldquo;They will appear in court soon,&rdquo; he said.Workers arrived in the morning but were told the forensic team had to work on the crime scene. Safety and transport MEC Mpho Motlhabane said: &ldquo;The entire chamber is damaged. &ldquo;The development plan has not been approved so they can&rsquo;t say their projects were not prioritised.&ldquo;The mayor is safe and resting.&rdquo;Last month the North West government appointed a task team to deal with service delivery protests after violence broke out. Premier Supra Mahumapelo&rsquo;s spokesman Brian Setswambung said the task team has been holding meetings with residents. Yesterday, armed private security personnel were guarding the building.
