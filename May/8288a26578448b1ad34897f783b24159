A 36-YEAR-OLD woman was allegedly raped and robbed on her way to catch a taxi to Saselamani Village on Friday afternoon.The woman from Makuleke Village outside Malamulele, Limpopo, said she was walking alone through the bushes when the incident occurred. The mum of two told Daily Sun: &ldquo;A man suddenly came from the bushes, threatened me with a knife, and dragged me away. &ldquo;He took me to a tree and said he wanted to have sex with me. When I said no, he said he would kill me if I didn&rsquo;t co-operate. &ldquo;I did as he said because I didn&rsquo;t want to die and leave my children as orphans. He undressed me, and then raped me.&rdquo;The victim said her ordeal went on for about 30 minutes. After raping her, the man apparently took R800 from her purse and disappeared back into the bushes. &ldquo;After the incident I went back home and called the police,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They came to my house and took me to the hospital, where I was treated and received counselling.&rdquo;Police spokesman Warrant Officer Samuel Matsimbi said: &ldquo;A case of rape has been opened and we&rsquo;re looking for the suspect. &ldquo;We appeal to all women to avoid walking alone through routes where there are bushes.&rdquo;
