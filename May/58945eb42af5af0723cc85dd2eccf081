A SCUFFLE broke out between Black First Land First (BFLF) head Andile Mngxitama and Standing Committee on Finance chairman Yunus Carrim today during public hearings on economic transformation.Mngxitama had given a presentation titled the Malikane Proposals, which called on Parliament to create a new National Economic Plan, based on the ideology of radical economic transformation espoused by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba&rsquo;s adviser Chris Malikane.A scuffle apparently broke out after Mngxitama started giving Carrim &ndash; a member of the Communist Party &ndash; a lecture on Marxism.DA finance spokesman David Maynier caught the moment on camera, tweeting that the &ldquo;BFLF movement gets into a scuffle in Parliament&rdquo;.The BFLF movement gets into a scuffle in @ParliamentofRSA! pic.twitter.com/geTNJYx410&mdash; David Maynier MP (@DavidMaynier) May 3, 2017&nbsp; "The Guptas' foot-soldiers, the BFLF came here, with ANN7 in tow, to provoke and disrupt with their so-called Malikane Proposals,&rdquo; Maynier told Fin24.&ldquo;The BFLF scuffle will have absolutely no effect beyond a five-minute movie on ANN7."The link between BFLF and the Guptas was made in a document titled "Bell Pottinger PR support for the Gupta family" allegedly written by former Bell Pottinger employees, which claimed that the UK firm "either helped set up or funded two organisations, the Decolonisation Foundation and BFLF", according to a report in the Sunday Times.The BFLF clashed with protesters outside the Gupta residence in Saxonwold last month.&nbsp;http://www.fin24.com/Economy/brawl-at-parly-debate-on-economic-transformation-20170503&nbsp;
