IT SEEMS as if baboons want their fair share, now that it&rsquo;s harvesting season . . . And farmers in Makuleke Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, have been complaining that the naughty, hungry beasts eat their crops!They told Daily Sun that the baboons ate their crops, and they had tried to scare them off. The troops apparent left the nearby Kruger National Park and stole into their fields in the morning to feast.Gogo Nwa-gijha Maluleke said: &ldquo;When I placed a hat and clothes on top of an anthill, I thought they&rsquo;d get scared and leave my crops alone, but the trick only worked for a few days.&ldquo;They soon returned and, as days went by, more and more baboons kept coming to my fields to wreak havoc. I&rsquo;ve lost all hope and I&rsquo;m thinking of giving up farming.&rdquo; The problem has been going on for years and was reported to game rangers, but nothing was done about it. &ldquo;The rangers told us that baboons live in the bush, and there was nothing they could do to help us,&rdquo; said gogo Nwa-gijha. Another farmer, gogo N&rsquo;wajono Hlungwani (67), said she was gatvol of the greedy baboons. SA Wildlife Trade and Regulations&rsquo; Thomas Chauke said they&rsquo;re not allowed to kill baboons as the bush is their home.
