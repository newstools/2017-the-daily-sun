THE anti-Zuma faction at Cosatu&rsquo;s Workers&rsquo; Day rally in Bloemfontein has succeeded in collapsing the rally.After hours of anger and chaos, Cosatu&rsquo;s provincial executive committee announced that there will be no speeches at the rally. Both SACP&rsquo;s Blade Nzimande and President Jacob Zuma were expected to address the rally.The run up to the rally was marred by controversy, with Cosatu-affiliated unions like Nehawu and NUM strongly objecting to Zuma speaking at the rally.Cosatu argued that it had invited its alliance partner, the ANC, to attend its rally, and was in no position to dictate to it who it should send.All leaders &ndash; whether from Cosatu or the ANC &ndash; were incapable of bringing the rowdy, jeering crowd to order. Zuma, Nzimande and other officials waited glumly under a tent as the chaos unfolded before their eyes.The rally was swiftly brought to a close as a memorandum was handed over, and the crowd informed they were now free to go.#WorkersDay Zuma has a short chat with Magashule by the car before he enters @dailysunsa&mdash; Simon Nare (@simonphomo) May 1, 2017#WorkersDay Memorandum handed over and the rally is over.
