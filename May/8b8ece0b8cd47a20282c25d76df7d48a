I told him I depended on my pension to survive and didn&rsquo;t have that kind of money.&rdquo; She said he threatened to burn Tumi if he didn&rsquo;t get his money. He left, claiming he was going back to Tshwane. But the man was back again the next day.To avoid him the gogo left, saying her cousin had called her.
