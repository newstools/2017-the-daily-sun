Our culture demands that the dead be given a dignified funeral so that they can rest in peace.&rdquo; She said she believed that if her father&rsquo;s remains continued to stay at the mortuary, something bad would eventually happen to her.She told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the burning of her father was mysterious and police believe it was arson.
