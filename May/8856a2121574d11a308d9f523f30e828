MARITZBURG United are out to end Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; Absa Premiership title defence. The battle ground for this match has been set and tomorrow night is the date. Lucas Moripe Stadium in Tshwane will play host for this match, with kick off at 7.30pm. Both teams are desperate to secure maximum points. Brazilians need the points to get within a single match to defend their title. The Team of Choice, meanwhile, need them to secure their top eight spot. Fortune Makaringe, who is enjoying his game lately in the middle of the park at United, said they are optimistic about winning this one.He said:&rdquo;Our approach is simple - we go there, enjoy ourselves and win the match. Our last match at home was disappointing. We drew against Platinum Stars and we are looking to do better against Sundowns.&rdquo;The attacking midfielder said he believes that the pressure is not on them but on the Brazilians. Said Makaringe:&rdquo;Sundowns are the league champions. They are the one who want to defend their title. So, the pressure will be on them more than us in this match.&rdquo;The former Moroka Swallows man also said their goalless draw against Downs in the first round will mean nothing tomorrow. He said what is important now is what will happen at Lucas Moripe. Said Makaringe:&rdquo;In football you are only as good as your last match. That is how we see our last meeting against them at home. This is a new game now and the score is level. The good thing is that we are both going into this match having drawn our last matches. &ldquo;We are both disappointed and we want to make amends in this one. We too have a title that we are chasing just like them. Our title is a top eight finish. We have to win this match for us to achieve that.&rdquo;The 23-year-old, who is in his third season at United, also said this match will go down to who wants it the most.
