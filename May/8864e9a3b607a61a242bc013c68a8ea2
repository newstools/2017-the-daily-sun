THE Mthembus were fast asleep when, suddenly, they heard a loud bang. They woke up and checked what had happened . . . They found the wall of the bedroom where Nhlanhla Mthembu (27) was sleeping had collapsed! The family from Matikwe at Inanda, north of Durban, tried to pull Nhlanhla from under the rubble, but he was already dead. Family member Nolwazi Mfeka (27) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;This came as a shock to us. &ldquo;The house was old and the rainy weather, which started on Friday, may have caused walls to collapse.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful that today my uncle is dead. This house is very old. Even the councillor is aware.&rdquo; Nolwazi said the ward councillor had inspected the house in November last year. &ldquo;He promised to build a new RDP but never did. If he had kept his promise, this could have been prevented,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think they applied in 2001 and have been waiting for an RDP since then. No one is working in the family. They survive on social grants, which is not enough. &ldquo;They would have rebuilt the house if they had the money.&rdquo; Neighbour Nokubonga Luthuli (39) said she was aware of Nolwazi&rsquo;s claim that the councillor had promised to build the family an RDP. Nokubonga said: &ldquo;No one is working there. The children live alone and are suffering. The councillor should come and help them now.&rdquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was opened at Inanda Police Station. When contacted on his cellphone yesterday, Councillor Wiseman Nyaba said he was in church. He didn&rsquo;t respond to a text message sent by Daily Sun asking him about his promise to the Mthembu family.
