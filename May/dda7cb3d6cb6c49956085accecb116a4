PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has reportedly said that he agrees with President Robert Mugabe's views that Zimbabwe is "mischaraterised".The collapse of the country&rsquo;s currency and much of its economy has resulted in a widespread view of Zimbabwe as being in a state of near-crisis. However, in Mugabe&rsquo;s view all is well in his homeland."Well, I think the president answered that very well in the discussion because he indicated and said it is the view of others to call it fragile, but as far as he is concerned, he described how Zimbabwe is, and I agree with the president," Zuma was quoted as saying by The Herald.Mugabe yesterday insisted during a panel discussion on fragile states at the ongoing World Economic Forum on Africa (WEF) in Durban that his country was not a failed state."We are not a poor country and we can't be a fragile country. I can call America fragile - they went on their knees to China," Mugabe said.Many in Zimbabwe were amazed by his claim: "Zimbabwe is the most highly developed country in Africa. After South Africa, I want to see another country as highly developed." Zuma and Mugabe met to talk on the sidelines of the economic forum.Zuma said: "We discussed the issue of the situation in the country, the success of the World Economic Forum now and also about the need for us to meet more often, particularly the former liberation movements. So it was very good, friendly and brotherly discussion, absolutely." &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/zuma-i-agree-with-mugabe-zim-is-mischaracterised-pics-20170505
