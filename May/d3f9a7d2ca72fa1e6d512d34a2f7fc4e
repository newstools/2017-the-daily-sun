SOME naughty kids bunk school for a day or two. But a 12-year-old pupil at Mosaledi Primary School in Temba, near Hammanskraal in Tshwane, has allegedly taken skipping school to a whole new level.The unnamed schoolboy has allegedly been hanging out in a small shack next to the school premises and hasn&rsquo;t been in class since January!A concerned parent told Daily Sun the boy built a small makeshift house with boards and wood outside the schoolyard where he stays during school hours.She said the pupil comes to school every day but never enters the school premises.&ldquo;When other kids go to class, he goes to his house.&ldquo;If he is not playing with his marbles, he is inside sleeping. &ldquo;His friends join him at break but when the school bell rings they go back to class.&rdquo; A woman who sells sweets at the school gate claimed she tried to talk to the boy and to teachers.&ldquo;He always says he will tell me what&rsquo;s wrong, but never does. When he sees me, he runs away,&rdquo; she claimed.She claimed to have reported the pupil&rsquo;s situation to teachers but said they didn&rsquo;t do anything.&ldquo;They told me that the young boy was a problem and that he was disruptive in class.&rdquo;Acting Gauteng education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said the allegations were unfounded.&ldquo;The structure was built by pupils using materials that remained following the construction of a grade R classroom at the school. &ldquo;The structure is on the school premises next to the netball ground and has now been destroyed.&rdquo;
