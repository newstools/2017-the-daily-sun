DAN NKOSI says he has become living proof of the adage: patience is a virtue.&nbsp;This as the award-winning local bubblegum musician said he had been waiting for his money from the SABC for too long.According to Dan, the R50&thinsp;000&nbsp;was to have been in his possession from as far back as September &ndash; after then SABC chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng had staged a breakfast meeting, during which he promised the &ldquo;golden oldies&rdquo; stars the moolah.Said Dan: &ldquo;What annoys me is that the other artists &ndash; who are on Hlaudi&rsquo;s payroll &ndash; have been paid, while I have to deal with empty promises.&ldquo;The SABC should pay me what&rsquo;s due to me &ndash; as I&rsquo;ve waited too long for this money and no one&nbsp;has bothered to tell me what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;The Ganda Ganda hitmaker&nbsp;said the last time he heard from the SABC was when he was asked to submit his South African Revenue Service documents and bank account details for the approval and transfer of his money.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago was abrupt when asked for comment. He said Dan should go to the person who told him he had to bring documents and ask when they would be processed.The legendary musician from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni told Sunday Sun he was angry about the non-payment.He said he needed the money to he invest it in his company, Gandaganda Music and his Arts School of Excellence &ndash; to develop young talent in his community.Dan has 12 gold and two platinum discs under his belt.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so sad that old musicians like me are taken for a ride,&rdquo; said the musician who&rsquo;s been in the industry for more than three decades.Hlaudi refused to comment, saying he was not at the SABC for now.He referred all inquiries to Kaizer.
