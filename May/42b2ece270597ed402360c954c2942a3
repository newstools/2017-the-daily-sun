THE doctor worked at more than 60 medical institutions from Cape Town to Limpopo, conducting operations and prescribing medicine.&nbsp; Then an ID fraud case led cops straight to him, and the fong kong doctor was bust in his scrubs.&nbsp; And now police are also looking for his girlfriend, after she allegedly tried to help him escape from prison &ndash; with another ID trick!&nbsp; Police said the man, who had worked as a doctor at medical institutions in Cape Town, Gauteng, Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga, had never set foot in a medical school.&nbsp; Police got on his trail when two people, one of them a doctor, laid ID fraud complaints in 2012, claiming their IDs were being used by the fong kong doctor.&nbsp; Police bust him and he was kept in Nigel Prison, awaiting trial.&nbsp; It appears the alleged fraudster thought he could outsmart the law again, and he allegedly stole the ID of another prisoner who was about to be released on bail.&nbsp; Police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw said the man was allegedly being helped by his girlfriend. Rossouw said the woman visited the fake doctor in prison.&nbsp; &ldquo;During the visit they tried to pay bail for a prisoner who was about to be released on bail.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was then discovered that the fake doctor had impersonated another inmate and they were caught out.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fake doctor was taken to another prison.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rossouw asked the public to help police trace the wanted woman, Antoinette Khalumbo. He said Khalumbo is Zimbabwean and used to live in Grootvlei, Mpumalanga.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is the co-conspirator in the attempted escape and has been on the run since,&rdquo; said Rossouw.
