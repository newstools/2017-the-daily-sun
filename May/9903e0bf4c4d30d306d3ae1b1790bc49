Nedbank is rolling out the second season of the Ring of Steel campaign, which will provide more Ke Yona team players with the skills they require to make the most of their soccer talents, on and off the soccer field.&nbsp;While the campaign looks at financial and lifestyle management through the careers of Nedbank Ke Yona team search graduates; the advice and tools provided could be used by any athlete or anyone else looking to optimize the resources they have.&nbsp;This year, Bongani Mbuli and Jeremiah Nkwana join Ian Chikohwa, Aubrey Maphosa Modiba as Ke Yona team graduates who will be surrounded by a team of experts to enable them to develop sustainable football careers.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Ring of Steel campaign has put into practice what Nedbank does everyday; which is to use our financial expertise to do good. Through the Nedbank Cup, not only do we enable teams and players to achieve their goals, we also do the same for our clients and the communities we serve. Football is a lot like managing your finances; you must have a goal, work hard, be committed and find a team - like Nedbank, to enable you to achieve it&rdquo; says Desmond Osman; Head Of Marketing for Middle Markets at Nedbank.&nbsp;The Ring of Steel will provide the players with talent management, media training, personal branding and social media advice, image consulting and financial skills which will be provided by a team of experts, such as: Glyn Binkin (Agent), Mo Nassuirio (Financial Advisor), Helman Mkhalele (Mentor), Andre Arendse (Mentor), Abubaker Frizlaar (Style and Image) and Boity Thulo (Social Media Advisor).&nbsp;Binkin is arguably South Africa&rsquo;s top football agent and returns to guide the players, while soccer heavyweights Helman Mkhalele and Andre Arendse will draw from their extensive expertise in the game to support and nurture them. Nedbank&rsquo;s Ke Yona Team Search new TV presenter Boitumelo Thulo (professionally known as &lsquo;Boity&rsquo;) takes on the mantle of guiding the four Ke Yona Team Search graduates through the personal branding and social media tightrope, and Frizlaar&rsquo;s expert knowledge of style will ensure these graduates look good, while Nassuirio&rsquo;s extensive financial planning background will prepare the players with sound financial advice for the future. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess you can say I&rsquo;m one of the lucky ones to have been one of the first beneficiaries of the Ring of Steel. The sessions I had with Bra Helman and Mo last year gave me a lot to think about and I can safely say I made better and more calculated choices since then and I look forward to more engagement opportunities with them,&rdquo; says Ian Chikohwa, Ring of Steel beneficiary and amaTUKS player.&nbsp;A quick recap of last nights line up.
