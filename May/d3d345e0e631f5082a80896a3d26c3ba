IT seems maskandi musician Mthandeni &ldquo;Igcokama Elisha&rdquo; Manqele&rsquo;s recent act of klapping a journalist has made him persona non grata.&nbsp;This as organisers of the Nkandla May Rural Horse Riding event that took place in KwaZulu-Natal yesterday gave him the cold shoulder, despite the singer being a native of the area.Municipal spokesperson Mgcobeni Khanyile said the area&rsquo;s chief and residents were not impressed by Mthandeni&rsquo;s attack on Mthobisi Sithole, a reporter for a local isiZulu newspaper.Said Mgcobeni: &ldquo;He was booked to perform at the Nkandla May Music Extravaganza, which is part of the event.&ldquo;But we had to drop him because our chief told us he wanted him excluded from the line-up, following his act of klapping Mthobisi, and because his fans had caused chaos during the Inqokotho Maskandi Festival, at which two fans died.&rdquo;Nkandla&rsquo;s chief Zakhe Mpungose confirmed that he ordered the municipality to remove Mthandeni from the line-up.According to Mgcobeni: &ldquo;Also, we heard the residents of Nkandla were planning to stage a protest during his performance because he doesn&rsquo;t get along with their homeboy, maskandi musician Khuzani Mpungose.&rdquo;Mthandeni had klapped the journalist at the funeral of top maskandi fan, Mthokozisi Xulu, held at the province&rsquo;s Nongoma village two weeks ago.According to the official, organisers had hoped to secure Khuzani Mpungose for the show, but due to his commitments, the singer was not available.&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be at the South African Music Awards in North West on the same day. His fans were angry with us, asking why we booked Mthandeni instead of him,&rdquo; Mgcobeni said.Meanwhile, a cold Mthandeni refused to comment.His manager Vusi Leeuw, on the other hand, said the event organisers had a right to change their mind.&ldquo;They have every right to book and dismiss artists from their line-up,&rdquo; Vusi said.
