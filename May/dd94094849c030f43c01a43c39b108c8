AFRICA is a continent with a rich history. As the country joined the rest of the continent to commemorate Africa Day, we take a look at some of our rich cultural heritage.On Thursday, many people looked colourful in their traditional attire, and African dishes including Mogodu, Nigerian Egusi soup, Samp and beans, were part of the mix.&nbsp;Appreciation of African cuisine seems to grow by the day as creativity keeps elevating it. Our very own Chef Dee, (Doreen Molefe) says Africa oozes cuisines.&ldquo;We owe it to ourselves, as Africans, to be our own ambassadors and get as excited as when we explore other cuisines or cultures.&ldquo;We have amazing indigenous foods such as biltong, rooibos, amagwinya, atchar and mogodu. When Mopani worms are cooked with precision, they can be as much of a gourmet dish as samples of cuisines from other continents,&rdquo; said Chef Dee.She added that for our food to go global, people should start cooking it at home and support businesses that embrace the richness of this amazing African cuisines.Chef Agnes Maphumulo, who also owns her own catering company, told the People&rsquo;s Paper it&rsquo;s great to see people not limiting themselves only to Western cuisine.&ldquo;For a while, we were ashamed to enjoy our food in public spaces. We thought African food was only made to be enjoyed in our homes.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s changed over the years as people came with innovative ways of preparing traditional food,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason for people not to appreciate traditional foods. For some, it brings back memories of poverty. But that shouldn&rsquo;t stop us from appreciating what our elders passed on to us.&rdquo;Oliver Rantseli is co-founder of African Smoothie. The 24-year-old and his partners aim to introduce traditional beer to the youth of today from a stall at the Tembisa Street Food Market.&ldquo;The idea is to celebrate traditional beer (umqombothi) as it&rsquo;s only known for being consumed by elders during traditional ceremonies.&ldquo;The whole idea is to merge African culture with western culture. We&rsquo;ve seen how things are easily forgotten because they&rsquo;re from the past,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to leave our culture behind. That&rsquo;s why many young people don&rsquo;t really know that umqombothi exists.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not saying it&rsquo;s wrong to use it as part of our cultural beliefs, but we&rsquo;re saying our elders were smart enough to create alcohol with no side effects. We just add a little bit of flavour,&rdquo; added Oliver.African Smoothie comes in a variety of flavours, and it&rsquo;s enjoyed by the trendy cool kids who visit the Tembisa Street Food Market.
