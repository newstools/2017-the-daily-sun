LIMPOPO agriculture MEC Mapula Mokaba says Premier Stan Mathabatha mustn&rsquo;t vent his frustration on her.&nbsp;The sister of the late ANC Youth League firebrand Peter Mokaba &ndash; who died in 2002 &ndash; is fuming over the letter of demand she received from the premier.He demanded her to pay back an amount of R1,6&thinsp;million, which allegedly went missing when she was the transport MEC.But Mapula was not having it. She said Mathabatha was relying on an unsigned report from the public protector, which had allegedly landed in his hands unlawfully.Said Mapula: &ldquo;Former public protector Thuli Madonsela had already confirmed to me that the report was leaked unlawfully by an insider, who may end up in jail.&ldquo;Three months ago, my lawyer took the matter to the high court for review. I was told the matter would be worked on within 160 days. So, it&rsquo;s still sub judice, making Mathabatha&rsquo;s action against me premature.&rdquo;She said: &ldquo;If Mathabatha had issues with my brother, he should&rsquo;ve resolved it 14 years ago.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying that because he called me to his office, saying &lsquo;being Peter Mokaba&rsquo;s sister doesn&rsquo;t mean you are important&rsquo;. I then took the matter to the ANC national office, and he denied using Peter&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;Mapula said she was shocked by the premier&rsquo;s move. This because she allegedly met with him and his legal team &ldquo;to come up with anticorruption plans when I discovered irregularities&rdquo;.&ldquo;We agreed to bypass head of department Hanli du Plessis&rsquo;s office when appointing investigators because she was part of that corruption,&rdquo; Mapula said.&ldquo;IT guys discovered there was nothing in the computer server because the traffic cameras were not linking with that fake server. It was also uncovered that Du Plessis was doing business with her husband.&rdquo;Mapula then gave a breakdown of &ldquo;the issue&rdquo; Mathabatha was allegedly finding problematic. &ldquo;Seeing the competency of the IT guys, Mathabatha was happy and proposed the IT man should extend his hand to the departments of education, health and public works,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Before we could make transactions into the IT company&rsquo;s account, treasury wrote a letter instructing the provincial officer, Gavin Pratt, to end the contract immediately. I then terminated the contract &ndash; without any cent paid.&rdquo;The annoyed MEC, suggesting the premier could be playing dirty politics to score points, said: &ldquo;I know that whenever we go for elections, power mongers come up with &lsquo;issues&rsquo;. A leader must unite people, not divide them. I can&rsquo;t allow anyone to destroy me emotionally. Mathabatha and Du Plessis must be the ones accountable for that R1,6&thinsp;million.&rdquo;Du Plessis said her lawyer had taken the matter for review in the high court.Mathabatha&rsquo;s spokesperson Kenny Mathivha said it was the public protector&rsquo;s report that had instructed Mapula and Du Plessis to pay back the money, not the premier.&ldquo;If there were documents from their lawyers for review, Mathabatha would have waited for the court&rsquo;s decision. Now, there is no such court document,&rdquo; he said.
