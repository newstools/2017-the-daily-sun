AT least one person has been shot inside a popular nightclub in Loop Street, which has before been the scene of violence, in what appears to be more intense fighting in a battle over the bouncer trade.The Loop Street shooting, which happened last night shortly before midnight, comes less than a month after two men were wounded in Caf&eacute; Caprice in Camps Bay on 17 April.Police spokeswoman, Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the shooting and said an attempted murder case was under investigation.Unconfirmed rumours suggested that two people had been shot, but Rwexana was only aware of one."According to information an unidentified woman was shot and wounded by a stray bullet," she said."Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation. No one has been arrested at this stage."Both the Camps Bay shooting and Loop Street incident are widely believed to be linked to an underworld turf war.A new grouping is ousting an older, more established grouping, which has been in control of the nightclub security industry for years.Some sources, with links to the underworld, say the new grouping is trying to rid the establishments of drugs.But others say they are simply hijacking the lucrative nightclub security industry to channel drugs.Cape Town has been rocked by gangster-related violence recently, with 11 wounded and two killed earlier this week.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/another-person-shot-at-cape-town-nightclub-as-underworld-turf-war-continues-20170505
