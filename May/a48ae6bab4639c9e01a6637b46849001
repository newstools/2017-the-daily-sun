ZAMA zamas are usually hiding from the cops &ndash; but yesterday they were defiantly out in the open.A large group of illegal diamond miners marched to the offices of the Hawks and the mineral resources department in Kimberley, Northern Cape. The protesters demanded that cops protect them and stop harassing them, as they are only trying to make a living. They are members of an organisation called Mining Affected Communities United in Action. They said they joined the organisation because they didn&rsquo;t believe they were doing anything illegal as they were not stealing from anyone. Hundreds of zama zamas gathered in front of the Hawks office to hand over their memorandum of grievances. Their Northern Cape chairman, Lucky Seekoei, said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just taking what belongs to black people. &ldquo;We opened cases of theft of mining equipment against known companies but the police are doing nothing.&rdquo; Major-General Kholiswa Otola promised to look into the miners&rsquo; complaints. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t arrest those marching because every citizen has the right to protest. Illegal mining is against the law but people have to be caught doing it before they can be arrested,&rdquo; Otola said. Northern Cape mineral resources acting manager Kevin Mutheiwana also accepted a memorandum.
