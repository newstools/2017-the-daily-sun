GATVOL hostel dwellers evicted everyone they suspected of selling nyaope. Three alleged dealers were yesterday locked out of Sebokeng Hostel in the Vaal and told never to return.A resident told Daily Sun her son died in 2014 after injecting nyaope into his leg.&ldquo;He used to steal from me. He stole dishes, blankets and other household items to sell for drug money. &ldquo;He also stole from other people and I had to pay some of them for the damage he caused.&rdquo; She said she wants all the dealers to leave the hostel because the drugs they sell are killing children. Another resident, Nthabiseng Liametse, said she lost her sister to drugs. &ldquo;In 2014 she was hospitalised. Before she died, she told us she had bought drugs at the hostel,&rdquo; Nthabiseng said. When asked how her sister started smoking nyaope, she said: &ldquo;She first smoked dagga with her friends. When one of them said they had found new stuff, she smoked it due to peer pressure.&rdquo; The SunTeam spoke to one of the suspected dealers. She admitted she had been selling nyaope for two years. However, she said she stopped after she was forced out of her home by neighbours. The 48-year-old woman said: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t sold drugs for a month.&rdquo; When asked why she sold nyaope, she said she saw there was a market for it. &ldquo;My son smoked the drug long before I started selling it.&rdquo;
