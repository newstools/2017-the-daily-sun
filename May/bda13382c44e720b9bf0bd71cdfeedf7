THEMBALETHU Tambo (46) was surprised when he heard his niece praying in her shack on Friday night. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t usually pray at bedtime. It was the first time I heard her. I heard her ask God to help and keep her safe. I did not know it would be the last time I heard her voice.&rdquo;Thembalethu spoke to Daily Sun after Cape Town International Airport security guard Yonela Tambo (30) was allegedly robbed, shot and killed by thugs while she was preparing to go to work on Saturday morning. Her body was found next to a shipping container that is used as a rubbish bin near their home in Kosovo, Nyanga, close to Cape Town on Saturday morning.&ldquo;We live in separate shacks close to each other. When I woke up in the morning I went over to Yonela&rsquo;s shack to fetch washing soap, but when I got there I noticed her TV was gone. &ldquo;Then one of the neighbours called me and said my niece was found at the container. When I got there I tried to wake her up, but I saw a lot of blood and that she was already dead. &ldquo;I just started crying. Yonela was such a humble person. She has two kids in the Eastern Cape,&rdquo; said Thembalethu.Yonela was wearing her security guard uniform when she was found, ready to go to work. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said a case of murder had been opened.&ldquo;The body of an unidentified woman in her 30s was found with a gunshot wound. Suspects are yet to be arrested,&rdquo; said Rwexana.
