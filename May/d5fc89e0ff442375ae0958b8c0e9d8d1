SMALL traders are angry with the City of Cape Town for closing the toilets at Nonqubela informal market in Khayelitsha.The traders sell meat to commuters, passersby, taxi drivers, residents, hawkers and municipal workers.&ldquo;The toilets have been closed for a whole week and we are tired of peeing and defecating in small buckets inside our market stalls,&rdquo; said trader Nolubabalo Jacob.&ldquo;I asked a janitor about the closed toilets and she said they were closed because they were blocked. I also asked if she told the city about the blocked toilets, and she said city plumbers came to look and left without fixing them.&rdquo;Nolubabalo&rsquo;s medication makes her urinate a lot. She has stopped taking it midweek so that she does not have to pee continuously.&ldquo;Now I feel tired all the time and I oversleep because I don&rsquo;t take my treatment. I also feel ashamed when I have to close the door of my market stall and pee in the bucket while customers stand outside and ask what I&rsquo;m doing.&ldquo;Sometimes they lose patience and move to another stall.&rdquo;The traders brought five-litre buckets from home to relieve themselves. Nomacebo Ndumeni (42), who is diabetic, said: &ldquo;When I pee in the small bucket, my hip and womb operation is painful. I also feel ashamed when I have to empty the bucket in an open space while everybody is looking.&rdquo;Guards stationed nearby said city plumbers told them they first need to fix the drains before they can unblock the toilets.City of Cape Town&rsquo;s Joythi Naidoo said: &ldquo;The city is looking into this and will provide a response once officials have investigated. &ldquo;The facility was vandalised previously and we urge traders to report any damage immediately to city officials at the district office or via the call centre on 0860 103 089.&rdquo;
