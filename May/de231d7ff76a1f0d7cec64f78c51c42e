Soweto used to be the number one Kasi when it comes producing the biggest number of celebrities in the country. But it looks like the mighty kasi it's now losing its status. From music stars, soccer players and actors, people from Soweto used to dominate in all fields.But nowadays, it looks like other Kasis and even provinces are taking over from the Soweto. For example, over the past few years, musicians from Durban and other provinces have been dominating the Kwaito, Rap, Hip hop and house music circles, more than the guys from Soweto. Soweto used to be a household brand in the times artists such as Mdu, Mandoza, Zola, Mapaputsi, Pro Kid, Arthur, Tokollo of Tkzee, Kabelo of Tkzee, Trompies, Brown Dash, Mshoza, &nbsp;DJ Mbuso , Mzambiya, Chiskop, Mashamplani, Bricks and many more.But when was the last time a musician from Soweto won a top award such as 'song of the year or artist of the year award'? Lately, these awards seem to be won by artists from other Kasis and provinces. The same seems to be happening when it comes to acting.Soweto used to dominate other townships when it comes to producing actors and actresses. &nbsp;Daily/Sunday Sun Entertainment Editor, Lerato Matsoso, who is from Soweto, does not think her Kasi is losing it's grip as the top celebrity producer. "We can just say the industry has been opened up - that talent is now being sourced from from all over the country. "We were the pioneers - we used to be the ultimate choice for talent then,"said Matsoso. She says that after Pretoria, for example, Soweto is still the biggest place for house music. " We still have the&nbsp;annual&nbsp;Soweto&nbsp;Wine Festival&nbsp;and the Soweto fashion week amongst other things.&nbsp;This coming weekend we have the Soweto Deep House Festival. Make no mistake we still run things!" She says other places and provinces are growing because a lot of investment is taking place in those areas.&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU THINK?
