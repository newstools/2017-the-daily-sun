&ldquo;THE ANC is dead! Long live South Africa!&rdquo;These were the words of DA leader Mmusi Maimane during a speech yesterday about the realignment of South African politics. Speaking in the Women&rsquo;s Jail atrium at Constitution Hill, Joburg, he said he was not ashamed to say the events of the past few months had shaken him. He felt as if he was in mourning. He said he was mourning the death of something he had always cherished, the ANC. &ldquo;The ANC has caught the disease that infects so many liberation movements on our continent, the cancer of corruption, rent-seeking and patronage politics.&rdquo; Speaking about the brutality of colonialism, Maimane said Africans never agreed to be colonised. &ldquo;As a black South African whose family lived through colonial and apartheid oppression, I have nothing good to say about those evil systems. &ldquo;So let me say it today in clear terms: there is no place for racists, homophobes and sexists in the party I lead.&rdquo;Turning his attention back to the ANC, he said the party had become an obstacle to the progress of the country. &ldquo;It would be a mistake to think the last remaining good guys in the ANC can change a culture of corruption.&rdquo; He said coalitions were the way forward and opposition parties needed to put aside their petty differences and work together to chart a new course. &ldquo;We need to put all our energy into saving our country and I am prepared to work with all parties that share this goal. &ldquo;This includes those good people remaining in the ANC who have been moved by recent events to speak out about what is happening in their party.&rdquo;
