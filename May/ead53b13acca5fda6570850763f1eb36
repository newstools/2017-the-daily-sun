IT would have been better to tell President Jacob Zuma that he was not welcome at the May Day event instead of having him booed, ANC NEC member Lindiwe Sisulu said today."Whatever it was, it just wasn't good," was her summary of labour federation Cosatu's affiliates booing the president at the national Workers&rsquo; Day celebrations in Bloemfontein on Monday.Speeches had to be abandoned after workers, led by Nehawu, NUM and Sadtu heckled Zuma and called on him to step down."I'd like to see an ANC that is able to express itself without taking away the dignity of anybody," Sisulu said on the side-lines of the military veterans' dialogue on housing in Boksburg.Cosatu had refused to entertain the objections of some of its unions to Zuma being invited to the rally.Some had argued that the federation and the SACP had called for Zuma to step down and that having him speak at a Worker's Day event would send confusing messages."I believe it would have been better, if the workers felt they didn't want the president to address them, to have sent a delegation to say: 'Please don't come.' Then we wouldn't have this spectacle."The workers should have found another way to express their unhappiness, she said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-should-have-been-told-to-stay-away-from-may-day-rally-sisulu-20170503
