MANDLA Ncikazi sees Saturday&rsquo;s Absa Premiership match against Baroka FC as the one that could decide Golden Arrows&rsquo; season. Arrows aim to finish in the top eight. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende host Bakgaga at the Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban (3pm) in a fierce match that is regarded as six-pointer by both clubs.Ncikazi reckons anything less than maximum points would imply they have failed as coaches at Arrows this season. Said Ncikazi: &ldquo;Our aim in this match is to win and get back into the top eight. Losing could mean disaster for us because it could end our chances of getting that top eight spot. &ldquo;So this match is really important to us &ndash; it could be the one that decides whether we have a good season or not.&rdquo;Currently Arrows just are outside the top eight with 32 points, although they are equal on points with Ajax Cape Town who are in eighth position. The Urban Warriors have a superior goal difference to Arrows. Baroka, on the other hand, are down in the relegation zone and are desperate for points to survive the axe at the end of the season. It is certain that Bakgaga will come out guns blazing against Arrows.Said Ncikazi: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to plan against Baroka because you don&rsquo;t know which team they will come with. Against Orlando Pirates a few weeks ago they were on fire and then they looked like a different team after that. &ldquo;But whatever they throw at us we will be ready for it. The good thing about our players is that they don&rsquo;t give up. That motivates us as coaches. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how strong or difficult Baroka are, we will have to get the three points. I&rsquo;m sure they are also saying the same thing about us.&rdquo;Ncikazi added that their priority now was to make sure they don&rsquo;t trail too far behind Ajax or seventh place Maritzburg United. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lag too far behind them. There aren&rsquo;t many games left now, so we need to stay close to them and make sure we win our matches. &ldquo;We must get that top eight position at the end of the season.&rdquo;
