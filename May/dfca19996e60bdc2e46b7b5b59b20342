THE 10 people who drowned when the bakkie in which they were travelling was swept away by a swollen river in 1993 were remembered on Sunday.Minister of Public Works Nkosinathi Nhleko unveiled a memorial stone next to the new bridge in Bawa Village, Butterworth. The new bailey bridge which crosses the Bawa River was built through a partnership between the public works department and the defence force. A bailey bridge is a prefabricated truss-bridge that is manually assembled by connecting panels end-to-end.Nhleko said the victims were on their way home from town when the incident occurred. Bennet Vamva (55), who lost his wife in the tragedy, was not impressed. &ldquo;It has taken the government more than 20 years to rebuild the bridge. On top of this, this government does not maintain the roads.&ldquo;The most troubling part about my sad story is that my wife left behind four young children.&ldquo;One of them has become a hardened criminal. I blame the government for this because they didn&rsquo;t compensate us for our loss. &ldquo;My son saw crime as the only way out of poverty.&rdquo;Headman Mlungisi Nkqenkqa added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy at all. This so-called bailey bridge is useless.&rdquo;Nhleko said: &ldquo;The biggest lesson for us as government is to be proactive. We shouldn&rsquo;t have to lose lives first before we build bridges for our people.&rdquo;The Eastern Cape roads department has made R15 million available to build similar bridges in villages across Butterworth.
