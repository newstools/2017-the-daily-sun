WHEN the thugs broke into the school they had no idea they would soon have to account to the whole community. The three men who stole food meant for the children almost got the beating of their lives when residents of Kanana, Ekurhuleni, caught them red-handed. They were bust early on Tuesday morning with their loaded car parked outside the back fence of the school. The vehicle was packed with vegetables and tinned food meant for the feeding scheme at Kanana Primary School. As the heartless thugs packed the last load of stolen goods into their car, they thought they were about to make a clean break. But community members were watching. They were greeted by scores of residents armed with sjamboks. The thugs dropped everything and ran to the other side of the school, before disappearing. Mantsi Molapo (46), a resident at the scene, said everyone was sick and tired of crime in the area. &ldquo;We have to be alert day and night because crime is hectic here. Now that there is nothing left to steal from our houses these people are targeting schools. We have been forced to guard our schools ourselves.&rdquo;The food in the abandoned car was unloaded and taken back to the school. Rabie Ridge police confirmed the incident and said a case of theft was opened.Cops said they were looking for the owner of the car and two other men.
