Dark Lipstick is a beauty trend that seems extremely intimidating and only for a beauty guru.&nbsp; This Gothic inspired beauty trend is the perfect accessory for the everyday girl this season.&nbsp; With these five simple tips, you too can also rock dark lipstick:&nbsp; 1. Wear it with a natural looking face Because a dark colour is so dramatic on its own, it's best to keep the face very simple. Just a bit of foundation, powder, eye liner and massacre is all you need. &nbsp; 2. Wear it in Winter Just think of it, bright colours are associated with warmth, happiness and laughter - all things that describe spring and summer. Autumn and winter are associated with more neutral dark colours. Autumn and winter are seasons where dark colours are dominate. So wearing a Dark lipstick colour works best in the colder seasons.&nbsp; 3. Wear it with a simple outfit Dark Lipstick is an accessory on its own. When wearing dark lipstick, you really want that beauty accessory to be the focal point of your outfit. So wear dark Lipstick with a simple outfit like a LBD or jeans and a white shirt. &nbsp; 4. Wear the perfect shade From plums, reds, purple and blues, there are so many different shades of Dark lipstick. Keep in mind your skin tone. There are different shades of colours that work well for different skin tones. Find a shade that suits you, and take your time with it. You can also go to any beauty shop and ask the store makeup artists to help you find the perfect shade. 5. Wear it with Confidence&nbsp; Remember this! Anything and everything you do, do it with confidence. So as you apply your dark lipstick on, do not forget to apply a coat of confidence too.
