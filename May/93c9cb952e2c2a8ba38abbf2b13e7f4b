TODAY marks the most important day in most people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp;And just in case you happen to be a slacker, SunBuzz would like to remind you that it&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s Day.Now, to give you some ideas on how best to prepare for next year, the SunTeam asked some of your favourite celebs to share what their plans were for that super special woman in their lives.So, if you had nothing planned, you should be ashamed! And not only that, but you should be jealous because some mums &ndash; not yours &ndash; are going to be spoiled.Take Metro FM&rsquo;s Lerato Kganyago, who co-hosts The Bridge show that airs weekdays from 10am to midday.The sexy radio star said she went out of her way to make this day a memorable one for her mum.Said Lerato: &ldquo;The first thing we&rsquo;ll do is go to church.&ldquo;My mum is my pillar of strength, that&rsquo;s why I celebrate her everyday.&ldquo;So, in a nutshell, I&rsquo;ve planned to prepare my queen breakfast in bed and pamper her the whole day!&rdquo;On the other hand, the co-host of YFM&rsquo;s Smash and Grab breakfast show, Lebang Kgosana, had planned an amazing treat.&ldquo;Every year, we do lunch at a fancy restaurant and get my mum a few gifts to spoil her,&rdquo; Lebang enthused.&ldquo;But this year, we decided to do something different. We&rsquo;ll be spending time together at home, preparing a three-course meal as a family. I have two brothers, so between the three of us, we each chose a starter, main course and dessert to prepare.&rdquo;The radio personality, who insisted her mum would be treated like a queen, said: &ldquo;We intend to take out the fine china and silver cutlery, which usually comes out when there are guests. But today mum&rsquo;s our special guest of honour.&rdquo;Lebang also had some advice to share: &ldquo;To the reader with a limited or no budget, creatively use what you have, and make it special.&rdquo;Meanwhile, A-List rapper Kwesta (real name Senzo Vilakazi) moved mountains to treat not one, but his two leading ladies.In a sheer stroke of creativity, Kwesta has booked a spa treatment for his mum and wife &ndash; for the ultimate bonding experience between umakoti and her mother-in-law. Now that&rsquo;s just slick.Said Kwesta: &ldquo;Although I have a gig today, I&rsquo;ve made sure that I show appreciation to the most wonderful women in my life.&ldquo;Why two women? Well, one gave me life and breathed courage into me. The other one gave me the gift of life and love. I&rsquo;m truly grateful for them.&rdquo;But the rapper cautioned that making time for a parent and showing them your appreciation was more important than any gift money could ever buy.
