WITH less than five weeks before the Fifa Under-20 World Cup kicks off, South Africa coach Thabo Senong continues to face challenges in the team&rsquo;s preparations. Amajita flew out to the Netherlands last Thursday, where their preparations were supposed to begin with three planned friendlies against Feyenoord, PEC Zwolle and Ajax Amsterdam. However, Feyenoord pulled out. Senong and his team arranged another friendly but had to travel to Germany, where they lost 1-0 to VFL Bochum. SunSport can also confirm that Portugal based Luther Singh has still not reported for camp. Singh was supposed to join the squad in the Netherlands after the team&rsquo;s departure last week. The camp that was scheduled to run for two weeks has since been cut to only six days because of delays Amajita faced. The delays came about because the coach was forced to make changes to his squad after some clubs refused to release first team players. Amajita return on Thursday, which is when Senong will select the final squad of 21 who will represent Mzansi at the South Korea World Cup from 20 May to 11 June. The squad will travel to South Korea on 6 May to spend a week there before the competition starts. They will conclude their six-day training camp tonight with a friendly match against PEC Zwolle. Despite all the setbacks Senong believes the trip has been a fruitful one for his players. He said: &ldquo;These things happen. I am confident the objective will be achieved. It&rsquo;s unfortunate things happened this way but we can&rsquo;t look back now and cry over spilled milk. &ldquo;The players are growing mentally and becoming stronger physically, and that is very pleasing.&rdquo;
