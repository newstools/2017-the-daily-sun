STUART Baxter returns to Bafana Bafana &ndash; AGAIN! The Scotsman, who led Bafana between 2004 and 2005, was confirmed by Safa yesterday following months of ducking and diving from the national football controlling body. Baxter will however first have to finish his duties with SuperSport United where he is currently employed, but the three-year contract will end after 27 May when the current season ends.SunSport understands that Safa are prepared to fork out about R5 million in compensation to have the former national coach back in their ensemble.Safa will apparently pay SuperSport R3 million, clear their contractual breach with ex-coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba with a reported R2 million and Baxter&rsquo;s R1 million monthly salary.It is believed that Baxter will bring his own technical bench and that Owen Da Gama (SA U-23 coach), Thabo Senong (U-20) and Molefi Ntseki&rsquo;s (U-17) future with Bafana remains in doubt.South Africans have been worried sick while Safa&rsquo;s delaying tactics with the Bafana coach have been going on for a full four months following Mashaba&rsquo;s axing in December.Baxter&rsquo;s first assignment with Bafana will be an Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Nigeria&rsquo;s Super Eagles on the weekend of 9-11 June in Abuja.&ldquo;Safa and SuperSport United have agreed that Baxter gets time off following the final league match on 27 May to prepare Bafana for the upcoming Afcon match against Nigeria,&rdquo; a Safa statement read.Safa chief executive Dennis Mumble yesterday said they were pleased that the matter was finally settled.&ldquo;We are pleased to have finally reached agreement with Supersport on the release of Baxter. Safa believes that the coach has the necessary skills to navigate the tough Afcon qualification path and the Fifa World Cup. We thank Supersport United for their support.&rdquo;In their joint statement, SuperSport boss Stan Matthews admitted their loss: &ldquo;We obviously did not want to lose Stuart as our coach. He has done a great job in getting us to the competitive level we expect as a club, however, we also understand that he would like to have a final go at competing at a Fifa World Cup and that would be a fantastic achievement for the country as a whole.&rdquo;However, he said their focus now, which still included Baxter, was to finish the season in a respectable position, become the first club to retain the Nedbank Cup, and to fight their way through the group stages of the Caf Confederation Cup. Added Matthews: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad this matter is now settled. We can all focus on the job at hand, which is meeting our football targets for this season and planning ahead for next season.&rdquo;Baxter will officially be unveiled as Bafana head coach by Safa president Danny Jordaan upon his return to South Africa from Caf and Fifa commitments.SuperSport are in Group D along with TP Mazembe, Horoya and CF Mounana and will open their group matches next weekend.Baxter joined SuperSport United in January 2016 and led Matsatsantsa to a top eight finish and won them the Nedbank Cup trophy with a victory over Orlando Pirates.This season Supersport United reached the Telkom Cup final and face Chippa United in the Nedbank Cup semifinal on 20 May.
