SEVERAL Zimbabwean government schools have barred children from attending school due to outstanding fees. The move is seen as defying government directives for schools to accept livestock or labour as payment.Schools reopened for the second term in Zimbabwe this week on the back of severe economic hardship that has led to failure by parents to raise enough money for fees.Human rights groups bemoaned the subsequent moves by schools to send the children back home.They say it is a violation of minors&rsquo; right to basic education.The Zimbabwe Peace Project reported that at least 14 primary schools in Harare and Mashonaland Central provinces had sent pupils back home.The ministry of primary and secondary education has maintained that school authorities are not supposed to bar children from class but must find other ways for parents to pay outstanding fees.It asked schools to accept livestock and labour as payment if some parents were too impoverished to pay.&ldquo;Some school heads have defied this directive from the ministry and were sending children home this week in violation of the children&rsquo;s rights guaranteed by the constitution,&rdquo; complained the Zimbabwe Peace Project.It is reported that of the 14 schools that sent children home, only two were entering into payment plan agreements with parents of affected children, while the other schools were not taking any steps at all to ensure that children&rsquo;s right to education was not violated.Zimbabwe Peace Project said that while schools could not honour the right to basic education without adequate resources, they must take reasonable steps to ensure that the right of children to a basic education was not violated. The Zimbabwean constitution says every citizen and permanent resident of Zimbabwe has that right.President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s government is too broke to fund education for kids who cannot afford it. &ndash; CAJ NEWS
