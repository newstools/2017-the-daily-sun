THAPELO Thenda (23) thought joining the Born To Kill gang would make him untouchable . . . But on Tuesday, his body was found in a pool of blood, with three bullet wounds!The man from Khayelitsha in Mangaung was warned a month ago by his older brother to stay away from trouble &ndash; but he did not listen. His body was found 2km away from their shack by a passerby.Motlatse (36), the brother of the dead man, said: &ldquo;My brother was excited about joining a gang. He&rsquo;d come back late at night with a knife, with friends I&rsquo;ve never seen before. &ldquo;Last month he told me he had joined a gang. I told him being in a gang leads down two roads, death or jail &ndash; but he didn&rsquo;t take my word for it. &ldquo;On Monday night, he came to our shack with a group of about 30 men and told me he would be back. &ldquo;I heard from my neighbours that they were fighting with a rival gang. I was worried when he didn&rsquo;t come back home that night. &ldquo;On Tuesday morning, when I was getting ready to go to work, a neighbour told me he thought my brother had been killed. When I got to the scene, I realised it was him. &ldquo;My brother had three bullet wounds, two in the back and one at the back of his head, with a deep cut on his forehead, as if he had been hacked.&ldquo;If only he had listened to me, he would be alive today. Now we&rsquo;re sad as we don&rsquo;t know how we&rsquo;re going to bury him. Our parents died a long time ago.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Loraine Earle said: &ldquo;A case of murder is being investigated and no arrest has been made yet. &ldquo;The deceased had bullet wounds to the head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re urging the community to assist by providing information. &ldquo;They can provide information anonymously by phoning 08600 10111.&rdquo;
