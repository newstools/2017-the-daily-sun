BUYILE Tsetse is struggling to get an ID.The 36-year-old man from Krom Village in Sterkspruit has never had an ID in his life. Buyile told Daily Sun he never went to school. He said when he found work, his boss asked for his ID but he didn&rsquo;t have one. He returned home only to find that his mum had died. It made his problems worse because he couldn&rsquo;t get a birth certificate. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any other family because my mum&rsquo;s siblings have also died,&rdquo; said Buyile. He lives with his girlfriend, Thandi Ndalani, and they have four kids. He told the People&rsquo;s Paper that it&rsquo;s painful to live without an ID. &ldquo;I want to work and marry my girlfriend, but without an ID I can&rsquo;t.&ldquo;Home Affairs officials gave me a form that has to be filled in by someone who knows about my birth, but my relatives are all dead.&rdquo; The family survives on their kids&rsquo; child support grants. Sterkspruit Home Affairs manager Lucky Motsamai told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;We are willing to help Buyile if he meets the requirements. &ldquo;If his mother has died, then he should bring her death certificate.&rdquo;
