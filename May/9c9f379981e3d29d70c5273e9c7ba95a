THE MC CREW will see to it that sbujwa survives!Thapelo Makhutla (24), Lucky Mphuthi (25) and Nhlanhla Zwane (25), from Orange Farm in the Vaal, regard sbujwa as a lifestyle dance for the younger generation.Daily Sun spoke to Lucky and Thapelo. Lucky said: &ldquo;Sbujwa teaches us that we should take care of ourselves and be peaceful. We are humble. &ldquo;We were brought together by Rodney Kgaphola, a popular sbujwa dancer in Soweto and the Vaal.&rdquo;There were five members when MC Crew started out but they are happy to be three now. They perform at weddings, parties and corporate events. Their biggest achievement was dancing in a festival called Soul Dancer at the Joburg Theatre in 2009.&ldquo;When I am on stage, particularly when I&rsquo;m dancing to tribal music, it&rsquo;s like an inner spirit is unleashed,&rdquo; said Thapelo.Lucky said he sees himself as a designer of dance moves. &ldquo;When I dance, I leave a blueprint on stage.&rdquo;Last week, at the Red Square dance competition at Cosmo City, north of Joburg, a girl kissed Lucky after his performance. &ldquo;I see this as a compliment but I don&rsquo;t take advantage. Sbujwa means respect.&rdquo;When Lucky is not dancing, he is a salesman at a logistic company. Thapelo is a fashion designer.
