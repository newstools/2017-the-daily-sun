AT this school, some subjects simply aren&rsquo;t taught as there aren&rsquo;t enough teachers.But since Tuesday, there have been no lessons!Pupils from Sinethemba Public School in Mlungisi township, near Stutterheim, Eastern Cape burned tyres and boycotted class. They said they were sick of doing nothing. The school has been short of five teachers for eight subjects since January. Yesterday parents, teachers and pupils met to find a way forward. Grade 12 pupil Phumelela Sonjiwa (21) said: &ldquo;We have 19 teachers, but are missing teachers for eight subjects. Pupils experience problems from grade 8 to 12. The department has failed to reply to our grievances.&rdquo; He said pupils decided to toyi-toyi and burn tyres without parents&rsquo; or teachers&rsquo; knowledge and vowed no teaching would take place until government responded. SGB chairwoman Nokuphumla Vellem said the situation was worrying. &ldquo;As parents we tried to intervene and went to the MEC, asking for teachers.&rdquo; She said they got no help from government. There are two high schools in Mlungisi and she suspected government wanted theirs to fail so there would only be one school. She said parents stopped the kids from destroying school property.Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said it was untrue that government wanted the school to fail. &ldquo;A delegation will visit the school and discuss the way forward.&rdquo;
