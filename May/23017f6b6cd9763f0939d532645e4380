FRIENDS of Hlaudi Motsoeneng have warned the government that it will face the music if it doesn&rsquo;t remove the SABC&rsquo;s newly appointed interim board. Speaking today in the company of an angry crowd outside the SABC offices in Auckland Park, Joburg, Friends of Hlaudi's activist, Ernest Moikangoa said: "Those who think they have arrived and are in charge, if they don't deal with this interim board, we will meet them in 2019 and they are not going to believe it." Motsoeneng was recently removed from the SABC after a long and controversial career, including his role as the organisation&rsquo;s boss. The &lsquo;Friends of Hlaudi&rsquo; organisation emerged in response.Among the decisions Motsoeneng made while top boss at the SABC was to implement a policy that 90% of SABC radio music content should be by local artists.This was the particular sticking point for the protesters today. The SABC&rsquo;s interim board, appointed following the collapse of the previous one, has questioned the 90% policy as being bad for business as the numbers of listeners and advertisers has declined. Moikangoa added: "Come 2019, it will be &lsquo;Business Unusual&rsquo;. We are cautioning them, we are warning them and we are very clear that we are not playing marbles." He said that if the government didn&rsquo;t listen to this warning, they will shut down all SABC studios.The memorandum was handed to SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago, who promised to forward it to the SABC interim board.He also said that the board was not going to reverse the 90% quota, but that it was under review.
