THE Limpopo Department of Education has denied allegations that thousands of pupils at more than four schools are starving because it is battling to find a service provider.The denial follows reports that 8 674 pupils were not provided School Nutrition Programme food for the past three months.The DA in Limpopo has alleged that it received information from concerned parents, principals and teachers that pupils had been attending school on empty stomachs.The department&rsquo;s spokesman, Naledzani Rasila, told Daily Sun that the party&rsquo;s claim was baseless and misleading. &ldquo;These are wrong allegations that are intended to discredit the department and the government in general,&rdquo; said Rasila. He said a supplier had visited schools in the Demamo circuit yesterday. A contracted service provider abandoned the project in January, he said, and the department had hired a temporary one while following proper channels to appoint a new contractor.The matter of the first contractor was being handled legally. Rasila said that pupils were continuing to receive food throughout the period during which the temporary contract was in place.He said a new service provider was appointed on Monday. The contract expires at the end of December.&ldquo;It has to be noted by the DA and all stakeholders that steps taken for any wrongdoing should be within the ambit of the law,&rdquo; said Rasila.
