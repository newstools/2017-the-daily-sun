KING of kwasa kwasa &ldquo;Malo A Botsheba&rdquo; is a die-hard Zuma fan from Mohlabaneng Village in Limpopo.&nbsp;Malo, whose real name is Stephen Sefofa, has more than 20 bakkies and 20 Quantums &ndash;&ensp;all branded with Zuma&rsquo;s face.&nbsp;But now with all the ANC infighting, he&rsquo;s confused about which face to put on his fleet of cars and taxis because the ANC is not united on the presidential candidate to replace Zuma.&nbsp;He told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I want to start campaigning, but I don&rsquo;t have a face. Zuma&rsquo;s face is going. The comrades are not united on who to support, and this is really frustrating. We need one name going to the conference.&nbsp;&ldquo;I love all of the top six, but my favourite is going.&rdquo;&nbsp;He continued: &ldquo;Branding all these cars costs a lot of money, and time is not on my side. I know the ANC has not opened the debate on nominations &ndash; but at least let&rsquo;s unite under one name. "If this continues, we&rsquo;re going to find ourselves with another breakaway group. We&rsquo;ve had UDM, Cope and EFF because of this infighting.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a politician but a musician. My fans always ask me about what&rsquo;s happening, but I sometimes don&rsquo;t have answers. I don&rsquo;t have a face to put on my cars.&rdquo;&nbsp;The UDM and other opposition parties have asked National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow the lawmakers to vote on Zuma&rsquo;s performance in a secret ballot.&nbsp;&ldquo;It must not be a secret, we must oppose that motion,&rdquo; said Malo.&nbsp;He refused to name his preferred candidate between Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.&nbsp;Sunday Sun reported in 2015 that this ardent supporter of the ruling party had problems when asking wealthy ANC comrades for campaign donations.&nbsp;Malo confirmed at the time that he was a struggling individual, who had nothing but love for the ANC.&nbsp;At that time, he told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I live in a village with no luxuries like a decent flushing toilet.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve branded all my cars and taxis in ANC colours because I love the organisation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
