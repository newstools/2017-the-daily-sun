PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe arrived late yesterday in Durban to attend the 27th World Economic Forum (WEF) for Africa - just as Zimbabwe's economic crisis intensifies.The 93-year-old president was seen off from Harare earlier in the day by both of his vice presidents, Emmerson Mnangagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko. The two are reportedly members of rival factions angling to succeed the long-time leader.Mugabe's frequent foreign trips irritate many in Zimbabwe, not least because they gobble up foreign currency which is in extremely short supply. Some locals have nicknamed him the "flying president" or the "visiting president&rdquo;.Ongoing cash shortages in Zimbabwe mean long waits in bank queues to withdraw small amounts of cash. Mugabe's government says Zimbabweans should use their bank cards but that's not an option for most vendors, public transport providers and others in the southern African country's vast informal economy.All eyes will be on the ageing leader to see how fit he seems. In early 2015, he stumbled and fell on a red carpet after descending from a plane. Footage of Mugabe attending the COP22 climate change summit in Marrekesh, Morocco in 2016 showed him seemingly confused and unsteady on his feet.This year&rsquo;s Africa leg of the WEF is themed Achieving Inclusive Growth through Responsive and Responsible Leadership and will see more than 1 000 participants, including business and government leaders, academia and NGOs from across the world. http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/hope-he-doesnt-fall-again-mugabe-is-in-durban-20170503WATCH: CONFUSED MUGABE IN MOROCCO, 2016&nbsp;&nbsp;
