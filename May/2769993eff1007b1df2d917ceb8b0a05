KAIZER CHIEFS midfielder, Joseph Molangoane, believes a lot of talented players will be unearthed in Alexandra, in Gauteng, through the Maimane Alfred Phiri Games.&nbsp;The tournament, which started in 2001, gives youngsters a chance to show their talent and hopefully realise their dream of playing in the Premier Soccer League (PSL).&nbsp;This is a breeding ground for coaches from the PSL and National First Division clubs, who flock to the grounds in search of rough diamonds, hoping to polish them into top-class players.&nbsp;Molangoane was among players discovered through the off-season tournament launched by former Bafana Bafana midfielder Alfred Phiri.&nbsp;The competition has attracted 140 teams throughout the country, and started yesterday, with junior teams battling it out, aiming to reach the finals on 16 June.&nbsp;The senior category will play after the draw is conducted on 14 June.&nbsp;Said Molangoane: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of talent in Alex. The coaches and scouts must go watch the games and they will find talent there.&nbsp;&ldquo;The likes of Lebogang Manyama, Mpho Makola, Patrick Phungwayo Patrick come from there. This will motivate youngsters to work hard.&rdquo;&nbsp;Molangoane is disappointed that his first season with Amakhosi has failed to yield trophies. This was the second season that Chiefs didn&rsquo;t win any silverware.&nbsp;Added Molangoane: &ldquo;I settled quickly and scored goals because the players supported me, together with the coach Steve Komphela.&nbsp;&ldquo;It has been great for me here at Chiefs. But the problem is we were unlucky.&nbsp;&ldquo;My wish was for us to lift the league trophy. Unfortunately, things didn&rsquo;t go our way.&rdquo;&nbsp;The 29-year-old player hopes good performance by Amakhosi will help him realise his dream of donning the Bafana Bafana jersey one day.&nbsp;He went on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel bad that I&rsquo;m not part of Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s squad to face Nigeria in the Afcon qualifiers. I think the coach considered a lot to select the team.&nbsp;&ldquo;I will continue working hard for my team and my time to play for the national team will come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
