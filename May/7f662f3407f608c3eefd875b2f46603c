DEPUTY president Cyril Ramaphosa is prepared to meet the widows of the 44 people who died at Marikana.The EFF chief whip, Floyd Shivambu awoke Parliament from its slumber this afternoon while Ramaphosa was answering questions by asking him what he meant with his apology about Marikana this past weekend at an event in the Eastern Cape.Speaker Baleka Mbete seemed reluctant to allow Shivambu's question, but Ramaphosa didn't shy away from answering, unlike when he was asked about the so-called Spy Report.Ramaphosa said he was asked a question about Marikana by a student, and afterward the student said to him that the intention wasn't to embarrass Ramaphosa."I didn't find it embarrassing. As a public servant and leader, I know I must be accountable," Ramaphosa said."I apologised for the language I used. Yes, I used unfortunate language," Ramaphosa said.In the aftermath of the Marikana massacre it emerged that Ramaphosa, then a non-executive director at Lonmin - the employer of the striking mineworkers, sent an email to government official calling for "concomitant action". This means he was asking cops to take action equal to the trouble being faced. Given that 10 people had already died when Ramaphosa sent this email, it could be understood as a call for cops to come with force. This they did on 16 August, gunning down 34 miners.Ramaphosa told Parliament, to applause from the ANC benches, he sent this email in an effort to prevent further killings, as mineworkers, cops and security guards had already been killed in a terrible way."I served mineworkers for nine years," said Ramaphosa, who was the first secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers' secretary in the 1980s."It could never be that I would want mineworkers killed, or anyone for that matter.""I'm prepared to meet the widows of those workers who were killed, the widows of the 44 killed," said Ramaphosa."As a leader, I'm prepared to be accountable," he concluded, amid applause from the ANC, while the EFF sat sullen and quiet.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ramaphosa-prepared-the-meet-marikana-widows-20170511
