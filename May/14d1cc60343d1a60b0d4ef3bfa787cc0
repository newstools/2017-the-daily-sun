THE male students from the University of Pretoria (UP) who held up sexist posters at female students during a residence event, face suspension.The university is currently in the process of identifying the student who will be suspended pending the outcome of the investigation into the matter.The offensive posters which read: "Personality only gets you so far, thereafter you must swallow", "Nice thigh gap, can I fill it", "I am a gentlemen, I will let you cum first", "Spit or swallow", "I hope you can like it in the Gat [buttocks] ne?" and "There's better uses for that mouth" were held up during a Serrie residence competition on Tuesday evening.Female students had to perform a dance in front of a crowd, to be judged by a panel of judges. These posters were allegedly meant to be a distraction to the dancers during their routine.UP spokeswoman Candice Jooste said their legal division have launched an investigation into the ordeal and that the male students are in the process of being identified and will subsequently be suspended."This will send a clear message that derogatory and offensive behaviour against women will not be tolerated as it does not form part of the university's values," said Jooste."Appropriate steps will be taken against those found guilty. We look forward to working with students to create greater awareness around the different forms of abuse."Jooste said the university was unaware of this practice having taken place before.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/makers-of-sexist-tuks-posters-face-suspension-20170518
