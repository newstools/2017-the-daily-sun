PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma today accepted the resignation of High Court Judge Mabel Jansen.Jansen, who was due to face a Judicial Conduct Tribunal over comments she made about rape and race in May 2015, resigned with immediate effect on Thursday.In a statement, Zuma thanked Jansen for her work and wished her well in her future endeavours.Jansen was placed on special leave following a social media storm after journalist Gillian Schutte posted excerpts of written exchanges she had with Jansen on Facebook in 2015 about the prevalence of rape in "black culture".The posts included comments by Jansen, such as: "In their culture a woman is there to pleasure them. Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman's consent is not required," and "I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious."Jansen declined to comment about her resignation.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-accepts-judge-mabel-jansens-resignation-20170508
