WHEN Sonke Mvubu struggled to make a profit with his shisa nyama business, he visited a local sangoma and asked him for muthi to attract customers.The sangoma demanded R10 000 and told Sonke to bathe a white goat in intelezi and braai it alive! He said the smell of the burning goat would supposedly attract customers.But the 35-year-old from Payne location in Mthatha was just arrested and charged with animal cruelty! The incident happened yesterday.&ldquo;The sangoma told me the smell of the burnt goat would attract customers from as far as Gauteng. I believed him and paid him R10 000,&rdquo; said Sonke.&ldquo;But then someone in the village alerted the cops and SPCA officials and I was thrown into the back of a police van in no time.&ldquo;The sangoma refuses to refund. He says the SPCA and cops were not part of the plan.&rdquo;Sangoma Mantshantsha Mbilo said it wasn&rsquo;t his fault that Sonke got arrested.&ldquo;I told Sonke to braai the goat at midnight when everyone is asleep but he did not listen. He did it at midday.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t refund him the R10 000 because the ancestors have already eaten it,&rdquo; said the sangoma.Mthatha SPCA head Vuyo Sangoni said they received a call about the live goat braai and immediately rushed to the village where they caught Sonke in the act.&ldquo;He was arrested and charged with animal cruelty but was released the same day with a warning,&rdquo; said Sangoni.
