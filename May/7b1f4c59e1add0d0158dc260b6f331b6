DRUG addicts are not only destroying their future, but those of school kids as well!Evil thugs broke into Inkuthalo Primary School in Zwide, Port Elizabeth, for the second time in a month. This was all because of their drug-fuelled search for copper and easy-to-sell appliances.The drug addicts are known to sell copper at scrapyards to get money so they can feed their habit. The secretary of the school, Original Langbooi, said: &ldquo;We arrived back at school on Tuesday and found it had been burgled. &ldquo;It was the second time in one month. The first incident occurred on 15 April. We suspect they broke in on Freedom Day. &ldquo;When they robbed the school on 15 April, they stole two grass-cutting machines, 21 computers from our computer lab, a stove, a gas cylinder, the principal&rsquo;s photocopying machine and other valuable items.&ldquo;We replaced what they had stolen except the grass-cutting machines. But now the thieves took them again. &ldquo;This time they stripped the copper wire from the ceiling and ransacked our toilets looking for copper.&ldquo;Last year, they murdered our caretaker during a burglary. This time they caused extensive damage. &ldquo;The toilets are not working and we are struggling to teach kids because of these conditions.&ldquo;They will continue to raid our school because we don&rsquo;t have a caretaker or a security guard.&rdquo;Loyiso Pulumani, the education spokesman, said: &ldquo;What happened is regrettable and I&rsquo;m trying to get full details from the regional head of the department.&rdquo;
