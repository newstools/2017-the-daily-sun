DON'T pay money to anyone who promises you a job at the Gauteng Health Department.&nbsp; There is a website advertising fake jobs at the Gauteng Health&nbsp;department. The department said was brought to their attention that a website&nbsp; www.neuvoo.co.za&nbsp;is advertising posts in the name of Leratong Hospital, requesting an amount of R1000 upfront.&nbsp; Department spokesperson Prince Hamnca warns community members not to fall victim to bogus job adverts that uses the Department&rsquo;s name and fraudulently invite people to apply for vacancies at different health facilities. Hamnca said another perpetrator is alleged to have been scamming people seeking employment by telling them they would need to pay R1&nbsp;800 to get employment at Helen Joseph Hospital. We want to state firmly that no money needs to be paid to apply for a job in the public service, he said.&nbsp; The Department advertises vacancies through appropriate and trustworthy channels such as Gauteng Online portal; Department of Public Service website and publish in relevant media. &nbsp; "Furthermore employment application forms at our Hospitals are dropped in designated boxes and these are processed through the short-listing and interview process," said Hamnca.&nbsp; The Department also encourages victims of this scam to report the matter to the police so that these allegations can be thoroughly investigated and culprits brought to justice. &nbsp;
