THE man who admitted to killing his nephew (4) shocked the court yesterday morning. Mandisi Gwanya (30) swore at everyone from the dock, leaving residents angry that he showed no remorse for what he had done. He appeared for less than 10 minutes in the packed Port St John’s Magistrates Court. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuZdTSMjc9Ji2KjZP_JbAldDKuc7pJfBTcEiTrb1NNqX6LXzST6LTTikuIor29L5104yQmOpUC2zDV17iJMsiIqBxBTo3_v0q_2-DMCHoLXVS_RP0HPyv98frp_SbDIK0QmGsMEy0RiedS2Fl6kPv76fle6J4d6MBAu4TecAx0-gm0l0DUsSiJ6jjYOv2O0cMx7rCNApTHr5QGQwiD40l2g7Xo8VeHfE9D2Vir47usoa-mbFhpji-At84WtsB7d1hz-wpSafe4l3eiZa0UlgInk--sC9_4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNI_VtsRW5v7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Gwanya was quick to tell the magistrate exactly what he said in English. His behaviour prompted the prosecutor to suggest he be taken for mental assessment.But magistrate Moonsamy Govender disagreed and said the accused could express himself very clearly. The case was postponed to 15 June for further investigations, and for the results of the post mortem to be prepared.Gwanya was arrested on Easter Monday at the family’s homestead in KwaNtsila Village, near Port St John’s.This was after his gogo found him surrounded by body parts of his nephew, Kamvelihle Ngala.In his last court appearance earlier this month, Gwanya shouted from the dock that he did not want bail, and that he was guilty of all charges against him.The court has since tightened its security and closed off the main entrance due to the crowds the case was drawing.Residents, pupils and community activists who had come out in large numbers were disappointed after being told what had happened in court. They vowed to be back for the next court appearance.
