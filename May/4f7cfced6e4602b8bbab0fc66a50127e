FURIOUS residents want a man who allegedly sold land fraudulently to be arrested. Brian Mahlangu (38) from Stjwetla squatter camp, outside Alexandra in Joburg said the man started selling sites in the kasi for R3 000 each last week.&ldquo;We were shocked to see a truck bringing materials to erect the first shack last Tuesday. In less than an hour, the shack was finished. We called a meeting and the seller confirmed he had sold the stand to a woman from Alexandra,&rdquo; he said.Brian said they gave the seller 24 hours to return the money and get rid of the shack, but it is still standing. So far, only one shack has been built but more stands have allegedly been sold to other buyers. Concerned residents reported the matter to Alexandra Police Station. &ldquo;Cops told us they need a letter from the councillor to lay criminal charges against the seller,&rdquo; said Brian. Councillor Werner Smit said he was aware of the issue.&ldquo;The mayoral committee is looking into the issue and if it&rsquo;s necessary, criminal charges will be opened against the seller,&rdquo; he said. Gauteng Department of Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said: &ldquo;The department will investigate these allegations.&rdquo;
