Johannes said he believed he was attacked for celebrating his team&rsquo;s victory. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never experienced such a beating in my life.&rdquo; Sundowns spokesman Thulani Thuswa said: &ldquo;This was a criminal act and is punishable by law.&rdquo; The attack on Johannes comes just a few months after Pirates fans went crazy after losing 6-0 to Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld, Tshwane in February.
