MARITZBURG United striker Evans Rusike has ended speculation about his future at the club. The Zimbabwean marksman has decided to stay and honour the two years remaining in his contract with the Midlands based outfit. Said Rusike: &ldquo;I had a two-year option when I signed with the club and they decided to exercise that option, so I will stay. I&rsquo;m happy here!&rdquo;Rusike&rsquo;s future has been the subject of speculation, with reports persisting that he could be leaving the club. Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates are two of the clubs he was linked with at the end of the 2015-16 and past season. &ldquo;I heard of all those rumours but no one came to me. No club has approached me,&rdquo; he told SunSport. Meanwhile, United interim coach Fadlu Davids has dedicated the top eight finish to the club&rsquo;s supporters. He said their support gave them the strength they needed this season. Said Davids: &ldquo;The difference between last season and this one is that this time around we managed to win most of our home games. &ldquo;Last season that wasn&rsquo;t the case and that is why we were almost relegated. Our supporters have been fantastic this season &ndash; this top eight finish is for them.&rdquo;
