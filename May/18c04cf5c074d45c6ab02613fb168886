MAMELODI SUNDOWNS coach, Pitso Mosimane, has dangled a fat carrot before aspiring football players who have ambitions of hanging gold medals on their necks for winning the Absa Premiership, Caf Champions League, Confederation Cup, Caf Super Cup or even the Fifa Club World Cup.The award-winning coach will be going on a shopping spree off season to seek stars who will temporarily close open gaps at their Chloorkop ensemble.&ldquo;We definitely need to get a few players who have not played in such big competitions,&rdquo; Mosimane said after their historic 3-1 Champions League Group C victory against DR Congo side AS Vita Club in Kinshasa midweek.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the carrot we&rsquo;ll dangle to the hungry players. Some of my players are going to lose form. This is their opportunity because they might have it in their careers.&ldquo;Playing for Sundowns might also open opportunities to play for Bafana Bafana and even gain financial benefit.&ldquo;This season we thought we would win the league, but it wasn&rsquo;t to be, it&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he said.The Brazilians completed their league fixtures yesterday, but the battle continues as they are going to host top Tunisian side Esperance in their Champions League clash at Lucas Moripe Stadium on 2 June.Having played a good 200-plus matches in the last two years non-stop, the Brazilians will have time to loosen up tight muscles before their next match against Esperance.Mosimane will go for weeks to months without most of his centre backs. Ricardo Nascimento, Wayne Arendse, Bangaly Soumahoro and Motjeka Madisha are out on injuries.Nascimento is undergoing a hip operation and has a groin injury to deal with too.There&rsquo;s also the threat of Khama Billiant, with an injury, and also Anthony Laffor who is also not in his best form.Most of the players were not in Congo with the team, but Downs managed to pull a miracle against the tough-as-teak Vita Club, which is why Mosimane is now out looking for fresher legs.&ldquo;We were emotional before the game,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But the team showed strength and experience of playing in Africa. We&rsquo;re coming out strong and surviving.&rdquo;He said they needed to box clever and not complain about injuries. So, they&rsquo;ll be opening their chequebook.The ex-Bafana coach has also heaped praise on Vita Club coach, Florent Ibenge.&ldquo;I look up to him. He&rsquo;s a humble guy. I admire him as he has raised the flag of black coaches in Africa.&nbsp;&ldquo;He does it well and united the country when he coached the national team and Vita Club at the same time.&nbsp;&ldquo;He had no issues for many years. And no one said he selected players from Vita.&rdquo;
