AFTER claiming the 2016-17 PSL title midweek, Bidvest Wits chief executive Jose Ferreira finally released the much sought after defender Reeve Frosler to Amajita.The South African Under-20s kick off their 2017 Fifa U-20 World Cup in South Korea against Japan on Sunday at 10am (SA time).Frosler&rsquo;s arrival will be a big relief for Amajita coach Thabo Senong, as it will give him options following the withdrawal of Phakamani Mahlambi due to injury.Senong seems stressed about his defence, which is why he called up Ajax Cape Town defender Sirgio Kammies as back-up when Mahlambi&rsquo;s injury became known. Frosler is already on his way to join his Amajita teammates, Ferreira said yesterday: &ldquo;We wish him and his teammates the best of luck at the World Cup. They are the future of the nation.&rdquo;The teenage right-back has been one of the best recruits this season and helped the Clever Boys clinch their first ever Absa Premiership title when they defeated Polokwane City 2-0 at Milpark on Wednesday. Wits head coach Gavin Hunt has been singing Frosler&rsquo;s praises since he came into the first team.That is why Wits were reluctant to release the youngster before they knew where the title was going, as Mamelodi Sundowns were so close on their tail.It is now expected that Kaizer Chiefs will form a guard of honour for Wits when the two clash in the last match of the season on 27 May. Senong admits it has not been easy for him and the boys, but reckons they are getting there. He said: &ldquo;Kammies will give us more options because we really need to stabilise our defence. We still have a few areas that we need to work on as a team, especially in defence.&rdquo; Senong said their opening match against the Japanese would not be a easy one, but said they too would face an uphill battle against Amajita.&ldquo;We are looking forward to a fruitful tournament,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;This is an opportunity for the boys to enjoy and learn.&rdquo;Senong is concerned about the threat troublesome Japan players Daiki Sugioka, Teruki Hara and Mizuki Ichimaru will pose.
