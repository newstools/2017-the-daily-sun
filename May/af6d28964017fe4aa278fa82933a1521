TWO organisations both claiming to be acting with former ANC veterans interests in mind hosted separate events yesterday ahead of a joint conference in June.Umkhonto We Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA), and the MK Council &ndash; which is made up of former generals and commissars of the liberation movement&rsquo;s army, will both be giving feedback to members, one in Ekurhuleni and the other near Soweto.This amid constant friction between the two groups over how their joint conference should be convened.MKMVA&rsquo;s chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe said the association was hosting an extended National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, which would include officials from provinces across the country.This comes after the council announced that it was due to have a national gathering for its members&rsquo; feedback, following its first National Assembly held in December.MK Council steering committee member, Thabang Makwetla, said their gathering was to give an update report to former MK members on engagements it had undertaken with ANC officials and MKMVA for a joint conference.About the MKMVA&rsquo;s NEC meeting falling on the same day the council had planned to brief members, Makwetla said: &ldquo;Even a person who is not so smart can read what actually the intended consequences of that kind of plan is.&rdquo;Makwetla said he believed it was to create confusion in terms of where people should be going.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t worry us,&rdquo; he said.Maphatsoe defended the parallel event, telling the media during the week that it was a scheduled meeting.He said the aim was to communicate decisions taken by MKMVA&rsquo;s national working committee to its NEC.Maphatsoe said he was worried about whether or not the NEC would accept some of those decisions.&ldquo;From where I&rsquo;m seated, I have seen the WhatsApp messages doing the rounds &ndash; it might be difficult for the NEC to endorse those decisions,&rdquo; Maphatsoe said.&ndash; News24
