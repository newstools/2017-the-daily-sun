MOSES Gazo (53) loves his goats . . . He even shares his yard with the animals to protect them from being stolen by thugs. Moses, from Zenzele squatter camp near Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, said the 90 goats surround his shack as he sleeps at night. &ldquo;This is to make sure that I can hear thugs when they try to steal my animals.&rdquo; Moses said he also has three big ducks, which help to keep thugs away. &ldquo;They quack at night and even during the day when they see uninvited guests close to the goats.&rdquo; Moses said nyaope addicts visit their squatter camp to see what they can steal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take chances because there are vultures everywhere.&rdquo; He told Daily Sun that he takes his goats to graze in the nearby bush. However, his neighbours said they can&rsquo;t stand the smell of the goats. &ldquo;The smell is unbearable,&rdquo; said a neighbour. Moses believes the goats bring him closer to his ancestors. &ldquo;They are my angels as they are close to the ancestors, so their numbers keep growing every year. &ldquo;They give me peace and protection,&rdquo; Moses told Daily Sun. &ldquo;Goats are wonderful, intelligent animals. It&rsquo;s not easy to steal them because they are stubborn. &ldquo;They are not like sheep, which follow orders. Goats are rebels.&rdquo; Moses told the People&rsquo;s Paper he started with two goats five years ago, and was amazed at how his livestock has grown beyond his expectations. &ldquo;I sell some and kill others for meat,&rdquo; he said.
