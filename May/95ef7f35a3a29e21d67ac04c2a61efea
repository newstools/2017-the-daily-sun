FRIENDS of Hlaudi and various artists clashed with police after they tried to force entry at the SABC. This was after their march from Peter Roos Park in Parktown to SABC offices to handover a memorandum of grievances to the new SABC interim board.They accused the interim board of trying to remove the 90% local content quota.Hlaudi's supporters want him to be reinstated as COO of the SABC and they are also demanding that the 90% local content rule be brought back.&nbsp; Currently happening outside SABC. These natives want their born acamedic/lecture back. ?????? pic.twitter.com/4J8DVGoNig&mdash; Sthathu (@owasendle) May 4, 2017The public, singers and never seen before actors arrived at Peters Roos Park 2 march against the removal of 90% local content qouta at SABC. pic.twitter.com/sQuTuhqyzc&mdash; Christopher Moagi (@ChrisMCMoagi) May 4, 2017
