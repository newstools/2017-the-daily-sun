POSTERS reading #NotInMyName were held up by hundreds of men and women marching to the Union Buildings.&nbsp; Community leader Kholofelo Masha apologised to women on behalf of men at the march in Tshwane on Saturday.&nbsp; WE ARE SORRY. WE APOLOGISE, HE SAID.&nbsp; Organisers said the march from Church Square to the Union Buildings was in response to the recent rapes and deadly attacks against women and children. Marchers held banners and placards with the words, &ldquo;I am trash&rdquo; and &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t own her&rdquo;. They also chanted slogans such as: &ldquo;If you strike a woman, you strike a rock&rdquo;.Kholofelo said men have been very quiet about abuse. &ldquo;We have failed our women because we have turned a blind eye to it.&rdquo; He said every man in South Africa should take responsibility for the abuse and killing of women that has occurred at the hands of men. &ldquo;You hear a woman screaming next door but you decide to carry on sleeping, even though you know there is a problem there. &ldquo;That attitude must end,&rdquo; he said. He urged everyone to take a stand. &ldquo;No man should get away with beating or raping a woman if anybody else is aware of what is going on. &ldquo;Men must be prepared to defend women.&ldquo;If the rapists shoot at us, we&rsquo;ll shoot them. &ldquo;If they fight us, we&rsquo;ll fight them.&rdquo; Kholofelo said the demonstration was about the active involvement of men in the fight against the women abuse.The marchers held a moment of silence for women who have been murdered.Kholofelo said the #NotInMyName movement was organised by men who will no longer accept violence against vulnerable citizens.&ldquo;The march here is the first demonstration of action we will be taking. &ldquo;We plan to go to schools and churches and hold community conferences under the #NotInMyName banner.&rdquo; He said it was high time for boys to be taught how to treat women respectfully.Several celebrities such as rappers AKA, Cassper Nyovest and actor Matli Mohapeloa took part in the march.
