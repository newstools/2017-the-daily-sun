SOUTH AFRICAN Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) president, Gideon Sam, is backing Mzansi long jump star, Luvo Manyonga.This as he believes the athlete &ndash; in the best form ever with two months to go before the biggest competition on the athletics calendar &ndash; will shine at the IAAF World Championships in London in August.The 26-year-old lanky jumper, based at the University of Pretoria, broke the Diamond League record with a leap of 8.61m in Shanghai, China, last week.This was a mere 4m shy of his African and personal best of 8.65m, set at the South Africa Senior Track and Field Championships in Potchefstroom in April.Sam, now in his third term as president of the local sports body, rescued Manyonga&rsquo;s career after the athlete was banned for performance enhancing substance in 2012.Sam was instrumental in bringing the energetic jumper to the High Performance Centre in Tshwane, to offer him a new lease on life.Soon after, Manyonga won a silver medal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.Said Sam: &ldquo;I told Luvo he was doing well, but that the big fish was in London. He&rsquo;s like a son to me. I believe he&rsquo;ll be the first jumper to go over 9m in London.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the kind of inspiration we need in this country.&rdquo;Sam was optimistic that the local athletics team would achieve as many as eight medals in London.Said Sam: &ldquo;Our athletics are on the right track. I&rsquo;ve been watching Luvo since he won the world champs title as a junior. My role is to support him. This year Luvo will make it big on the world stage. Athletics South Africa has embraced him as our superstar.&rdquo;He said runners such as Gift Leotlela, Akani Simbine and Manyonga will form part of the Opex set-up.
