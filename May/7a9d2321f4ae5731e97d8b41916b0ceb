IN THEIR bid to avenge the assassination of Chris Hani, the Young Communist League of SA has vowed to crush anything standing in their way if their call for an inquest continues to fall on deaf ears.League spokesman Molaodi Wa Sekake told Daily Sun they will use any means necessary if they do not get their way.&ldquo;Anyone who tries to block us will face the same fate Comrade Hani faced. The time for action is now. We&rsquo;ll be going around mobilising young people to join our call.&ldquo;We are going to tell them to defend themselves against the violence of poverty and unemployment.&rdquo; Wa Sekake said President Jacob Zuma had the power to &ldquo;reshuffle unilaterally&rdquo; and he also had the power to order an inquest into the death of Hani. &ldquo;We have been making a consistent call since the time of Thabo Mbeki. If Mbeki and Zuma claim they have lived, loved and struggled with Hani, why are they not doing anything about his death? &ldquo;Their reluctance fuels conspiracy theories about what really happened.&rdquo;
