AFTER the township protests south of Joburg, a Randfontein kasi went up in flames yesterday. Toekomsrus woke up to clouds of smoke as 200 gatvol residents took their anger to the streets.A municipal building was set on fire and when a fire engine raced to put out the flames it had to turn back as residents pelted it with stones. The busy R28 leading to Joburg was also blocked with burning tyres and rubbish. When the SunTeam visited the kasi yesterday burnt remains of the protest littered streets around the cop shop.Outraged residents said their fight was for RDP houses and employment on township projects.Nick Williams (32) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The municipality has isolated us. Development is happening in nearby Mohlakeng, but not here.&rdquo;Other residents also said they were being marginalised and neglected by the municipality.Rand West City spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe disagreed: &ldquo;The development is determined according to the needs of the Mohlakeng people. There is a road project in Toekomsrus, as that is what the need of the people was.&rdquo; He said different projects were aimed at developing the kasi, but employment depended on people&rsquo;s ability. &ldquo;RDP houses have been reserved for people of Toekomsrus and as far as Ventersdorp.&rdquo; Randfontein police spokesman Appel Ernst told Daily Sun the area remained tense and cops used rubber bullets to break up the protesters.&ldquo;A tuck shop was also looted after residents barricaded all entrances and exits to Toekomsrus. Public order police are at the scene,&rdquo; he said.
