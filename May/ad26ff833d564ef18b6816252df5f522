FURIOUS parents and pupils burnt tyres outside Umlazi Comprehensive Technical High School, south of Durban, yesterday.They demanded that 18 teachers who were recently fired be brought back. The remaining teachers stopped working last week in protest against the firing of their colleagues . . . There has been no teaching or learning at the school since Thursday! The teachers received dismissal letters last Monday. Parent Nomalungelo Dlamini (46) said the department should have thought about the school kids&rsquo; needs before letting the teachers go. &ldquo;If there was no need for the teachers, why were they brought to the school in the first place?&rdquo; said the furious Nomalungelo. &ldquo;The department must put our children&rsquo;s education first.&rdquo; Thembela Khanyile (44), whose child is in matric, said the high school&rsquo;s results were excellent because the teachers worked hard. &ldquo;Some of the fired staff members were grade 12 teachers. They have not been replaced,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How can I expect my son to pass when there are no teachers?&rdquo; Parents also want the school governing body to be reinstated. &ldquo;The SGB was dissolved last year. We need an SGB to correct this,&rdquo; he said.KZN education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still in talks with everyone involved, so that learning and teaching can continue.&rdquo; He could not say why the teachers were fired, saying it was an internal matter.
