THE 12 suspects went to the homestead for a cleansing ceremony . . . This was meant for them to avoid being arrested for crimes they may have committed! But the cleansing muthi they used was apparently not strong enough.The very same cops they needed protection from bust them at the inyanga&rsquo;s house . . . This happened while they were busy conducting a cleansing ritual!The suspects, aged between 23 and 46, are now in custody. They were charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, as well as possession of stolen property.It happened at KwaGqikazi in Ulundi, northern KZN, on Tuesday. They are expected to appear in the Ulundi Magistrates Court soon.KZN cops spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said local police, the tactical response team, the K9 unit and public order police bust 12 suspects and seized 12 firearms, as well as an assortment of ammunition.&ldquo;Members of the community reported suspicious activity at a homestead in the area,&rdquo; said Naicker. &ldquo;Police reacted and stormed the homestead, taking the men by surprise. &ldquo;A stolen vehicle, as well as six AK47 rifles, two Luger rifles, an R5 rifle, a revolver, two pistols and more than 120 rounds of ammunition were seized.&rdquo; He said initial investigations indicated that one of the pistols was stolen during a robbery at a business in Vryheid earlier this month. The vehicle appeared to have been stolen in Diepkloof in February this year.&ldquo;Indications are that they were in the area to undergo a cleansing ceremony for crimes they had committed. &ldquo;Detectives are confident they might be responsible for a number of high-profile murders and robberies committed in the province recently,&rdquo; said Naicker.KZN acting provincial commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, said the firearms would be sent for ballistic tests to determine if they were used in other crimes. A resident said the inyanga was a trustworthy person.
