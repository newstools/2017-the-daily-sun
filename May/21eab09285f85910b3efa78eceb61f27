THEY&rsquo;RE fed up with empty promises . . . And they want action!Residents of Soshanguve block KK said the City of Tshwane had done nothing to improve their lives.Yesterday, they barricaded roads and prevented motorists from entering or leaving the area. The residents said they&rsquo;d been living in shacks since 2009, while people who are new to the area got stands and RDPs.They claimed they were promised in 2014 that about 1 200 people would be moved to extensions 19 and 20 by March 2015. &ldquo;But the land that was allocated to us is occupied by other people, and we&rsquo;re still waiting,&rdquo; said a resident.They said they&rsquo;d continue to protest until Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga visited their area. Community leader Gift Moyo said most of them had been living in the area since 2009.&ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t have electricity, and 50 families are forced to share one communal tap,&rdquo; said Gift.He said they also used mobile toilets.Councillor Nomsa Ndlovu said: &ldquo;I came to the scene to try and resolve the matter, but the residents didn&rsquo;t want to listen to me.&rdquo;Ndlovu said she had tried to get in touch with member of mayoral committee for human settlements, Mandla Nkomo, but his phone was on voicemail.
