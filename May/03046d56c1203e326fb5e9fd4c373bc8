DURING the day, children play around the stinking portable toilets meant for Silahliwe Squatter Camp residents.The kids from Strand, near Cape Town don&rsquo;t seem to mind the smell, and people say they even climb on top of the cubicles while people are relieving themselves.Bulelwa Moshi (33) said: &ldquo;When you go there to do your business, you have to carry a stick to chase them away. They throw stones and play there after school. That place stinks and there are germs which will make them sick.&rdquo; She said they have tried chasing them away. &ldquo;They come back again. Parents should discipline their children.&rdquo; The SunTeam found children there, playing around and in the toilets. When asked why, one said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been doing it for some time and it&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo;In the evening it&rsquo;s a different story. People who use the road are robbed by thugs on their way back from work.Zithulele Fube (51) said thugs wait behind the toilets after taxis drop people. &ldquo;They hide and rob us. You have to ask the driver to stop and watch you going to your house or walk together.&rdquo;There are flushing toilets in the area but they are locked. Zithulele said if people want to go to the toilet at night they have to go in a group or use a bucket. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a solution because we can&rsquo;t ask for the toilets to be moved closer to the shacks. They smell bad.&rdquo;Councillor Anda Ntsodo said they weren&rsquo;t aware of the problem. &ldquo;We will see if we can find a solution. I will send someone to look into it,&rdquo; he said.
