I had no intention of doing this but when I heard that he wanted to kill me, I became angry,&rdquo; she told the court.She also said that her husband didn&rsquo;t support her and the kids, and they had marital problems that even their families couldn&rsquo;t help resolve. &ldquo;I went to the maintenance court for help and they requested both our payslips,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But my husband hid his payslip and I eventually gave up looking for it.&rdquo;Noluthando claimed that the night her husband was shot dead in October 2015, she and her dad had earlier gone to the cops to tell them about the alleged hit on her life by her husband.But prosecutor Nomapha Mvandaba showed her little mercy, asking why it took her a week to go to the cops.Noluthando said she had no idea that the hit would be that night.
