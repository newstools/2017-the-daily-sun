THE odds were against Lwandile Maphuza but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from achieving his dream of getting a degree. The 25-year-old from Europe squatter camp in Nyanga, Cape Town, graduated with a degree in business science from the University of Cape Town last year, despite coming from the most violent kasi in Mzansi and growing up in poverty. He said during his four years at the university he depended on meals from the student canteen. Lwandile told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Whenever I ate I thought of my family and worried that they might not have enough food. I would think that while I was eating they were probably hungry at home.&rdquo; Lwandile was raised by a single mum whose only source of income was child grants. The family of eight lives in a shack with only one bed and the floor gets soaked when it rains. Lwandile said: &ldquo;My mum encouraged me to carry on, saying I would be the first person in the family to graduate and get us out of poverty.&rdquo; However, Lwandile has hit another roadblock. He wants to study for an honours degree next year but needs a sponsor. Lwandile said when he finishes his studies and gets a job, he wants to build a proper house for his | family.
