ANGRY residents say they cannot enjoy a relaxing day at their park any more.&nbsp; This is because pupils from a local school have started using the park in Henry Street, Mangaung to poke!&nbsp; According to residents, the pupils gather in the park in their school uniforms and then smoke dagga and have sex.&nbsp; When the SunTeam visited the park on Tuesday, two pupils were spotted cuddling.&nbsp; Resident Nosipho Myeki (45) said she used to eat her lunch in the park, but she couldn&rsquo;t relax there any more.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disgusted by the manner in which these pupils behave.&nbsp; &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have any respect, but kiss each other in front of elders,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They disrespect people instead of studying and doing their homework. Some of these pupils smoke dagga openly in front of us.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe their parents are not even aware of what these kids are doing during school hours and after class. It&rsquo;s time for the municipality to act.&rdquo; Another resident appealed to the municipality to do something, or he would beat the kids to teach them manners.&nbsp; &ldquo;We cannot be forced to watch pornography by these kids in public.&rdquo;&nbsp; Qondile Khedama, spokesman for Mangaung Municipality, said: &ldquo;The municipality is only responsible for the upkeep of the park. We can&rsquo;t guard people to make sure they don&rsquo;t kiss each other or poke.&rdquo;&nbsp;
