Cable theft and ageing infrastructure have occasionally left homes, schools and businesses across Johannesburg in the dark.The area of Witpoortjie in Roodeport was badly affected as temperatures dropped over the weekend, leaving businesses and residents in the dark.Some suburbs in the city have been hit with power outages lasting as long as 36 hours over the past week.Many of the affected areas are struggling suburbs where small businesses don't have the money to install backup generators. They are forced to close shops early, which results in a situation that cuts into already thin profits of profitability.The owner of Top Chilla's bar and restaurant in Witpoortjie, who agreed to only give a first name, Linda, said they were forced to close on Sunday and Monday last week due to a 36-hour outage.Linda said that about R2 000 worth of meat went to waste during the closure as the fridges defrosted, and being closed for two nights led to a loss of thousands of rand.City Power spokesperson Virgil James said that many other food businesses faced similar losses during the more than 100 outages that occur around the city every month.James said power was cut in Kensington, Observatory, Bruma, Bramley and Bez Valley at 10.35pm on Wednesday, May 10 due to attempted cable theft. Electricity was restored to these areas around 7pm the next day, some 20 hours later."Attempted cable theft caused the cable and transformer to blow. Such damage usually takes 24 hours to repair, but if more faults are encountered then it takes even longer."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/power-outages-leave-small-joburg-businesses-in-the-dark-20170522
