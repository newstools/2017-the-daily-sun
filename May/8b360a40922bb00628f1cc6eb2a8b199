SECURITY guards reportedly fired rubber bullets and wounded students protesting at the Walter Sisulu University in Mthatha yesterday. Management had to shut down the busy Nelson Mandela Drive and Zamukulungisa campuses due to the violent protests which started on Monday. When the SunTeam visited Nelson Mandela Drive campus yesterday, there were fires everywhere. Students refused to listen to armed guards&rsquo; warnings to step away from the gates.The guards fired rubber bullets and the students dispersed, only to regroup and tease the guards. Thabiso Thiwani (19) was walking to campus from the shops when she was shot in the back with rubber bullets and fell to the ground. Her friends had to carry her to a taxi, which took her to hospital.It was unclear how many students were injured, but no arrests have been made. Public order police monitored the situation from a distance. The students are angry that 40 students, who apparently registered at the beginning of the year, have been told there is no space for them.SRC president Sinelizwi Mantangayi said: &ldquo;The university was also supposed to send students&rsquo; results to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme offices, but they didn&rsquo;t. Now they don&rsquo;t have funding.&rdquo; University spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said: &ldquo;There were only about 20 students affected by the financial aid issue, and we managed to fix it.&rdquo; Speaking about the 40 students who were sent away, Tukwayo said the university had a student intake quota which it was not supposed to exceed. &ldquo;We follow the quota set by the higher education department and we will be financially penalised if we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.
