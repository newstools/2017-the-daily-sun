POLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula has been sharply criticised for his comments about the murder of Karabo Mokoena. While addressing a crowd in Soshanguve, Tshwane on Saturday during an imbizo about crime, he referred to Karabo as a yellow bone and mentioned her beauty. Several people on social media said his comments were insensitive and implied that the lives of beautiful yellow bones were more important than other citizens. During his speech, the minister said: &ldquo;A suspect has been arrested for killing such a beautiful girl, a yellow bone. He killed her and even burned her with petrol.&rdquo; Speaking to Daily Sun, Mbalula&rsquo;s spokesman Vuyo Mhaga said: &ldquo;Yes, the minister did refer to Karabo as a beautiful yellow bone, but he was not being insensitive or trying to be funny. &ldquo;In his speech the minister touched on the fact that South Africa will never be considered safe until our women and children are protected. He emphasised that the brutal murder of Karabo should serve as an example to women not to subject themselves to abuse at the hands of men for any reason.&rdquo;However, many people have pointed out on social media that women are abused and killed across the country, and questioned whether Karabo&rsquo;s murder would have received as much attention if she was less attractive or darker- skinned. Karabo went missing over two weeks ago and a burned body believed to be hers was found in Bramley, Joburg on 29 April. It has been alleged that her boyfriend has confessed to killing her.
