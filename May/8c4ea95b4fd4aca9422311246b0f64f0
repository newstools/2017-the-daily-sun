BIDVEST WITS head coach, Gavin Hunt, is edging closer to joining a select band of coaches who have won the Absa Premiership title four times.&nbsp;But the no-nonsense Hunt, who won three league titles in a row with SuperSport United before joining the Clever Boys in 2013, is not getting carried away as The Students go into the final four games as favourites.If Wits win the championship for the first time in their history, Hunt will become the third coach after Gordon Igesund and the late Ted Dumitru to have won four league titles.He admitted he would tap into that knowledge of leading SuperSport to three league wins as he guides The Students into the final four matches, with a three points lead at the top of the table over defending champions, Mamelodi Sundowns.His charges face another stiff test when they host an improved Maritzburg United at the Bidvest Stadium today (3pm).He will be looking for his third straight home win after beating Downs 1-0 on Monday and Orlando Pirates by the same margin at their Milpark fortress on Thursday night.Hunt notched a remarkable record when the Clever Boys beat Bucs at a packed Bidvest Stadium on Thursday night to move to 54 points and open up a three points gap over Downs, who drew 2-2 at home to Platinum Stars the same night.Hunt admitted he&rsquo;s down to 18 fit players is expecting a battle from a fired up Team of Choice, who shocked third placed Cape Town City 1-0 at home last weekend.Said Hunt: &ldquo;I watched Maritzburg and they are good. There are no secrets in Mzansi soccer.&nbsp;&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t get ahead of ourselves.&ldquo;Maritzburg will give us different problems. We have to approach the Maritzburg game with the same desire and attitude. That&rsquo;s what football is all about.&nbsp;&ldquo;Forget about the people who are in cuckoo land and fairy land dreaming of pretty football. It&rsquo;s all about determination and a good attitude.&rdquo;Hunt said the key was to make the right substitutions as he did against Wits by bringing on Cuthbert Malajila who scored the only goal after replacing Sifiso Myeni.
