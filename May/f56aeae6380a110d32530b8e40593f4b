THEY live in fear of zama zamas, but not because of the crime and gun fights. In Matholesville, Roodepoort, west of Joburg, residents&rsquo; homes have become death traps.Zama zamas are burrowing away in the earth underneath their houses.They told Daily Sun they fear that their homes will one day collapse or simply get swallowed by the earth because of illegal miners who are mining in a nearby abandoned shaft.Roger Mabutha (57) said: &ldquo;I have been forced to leave my house because of these zama zamas. &ldquo;My kitchen floor has a huge hole in it. I fear my place will soon collapse and disappear underground and I&rsquo;ll go down with it.&ldquo;I am forced to seek shelter at a friend&rsquo;s house even though I have my own place. &ldquo;Sometimes we hear the zama zamas grinding and drilling underground and our floors vibrate. This is not fair. These are our houses and our lives are threatened.&rdquo;Nkosana Vundla said: &ldquo;We also fear for our children&rsquo;s lives. Recently a boy died when he fell into an old shaft in Boksburg.&ldquo;We have raised the matter several times with our councillor but he doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.&rdquo;City of Joburg spokesman Tony Turisan said: &ldquo;Residents have every right to complain because their lives are indeed in danger. &ldquo;It is the councillor&rsquo;s responsibility to forward the matter to the mayor so that the relevant department can survey the area. &ldquo;Government needs to deal with the situation and police must be sent there.&rdquo;
