HUNDREDS of gatvol villagers took to the streets in protest against suspected muthi killings on Monday.They marched to their cop shop, where they handed over a memorandum demanding the immediate arrest of those behind the killings! They believe the killers live in their village, Rooiboklaagte outside Acornhoek near Bushbuckridge.Protest leader Thabiso Mashaba claimed that resident Findley Ubisi (30) was kidnapped by two men. His bloodied body was found along the R40 in Hoedspruit on 13 March.Sipho Malope (26), who is from the same village, was apparently also kidnapped but managed to escape.&ldquo;Community members now fear for their lives,&rdquo; said Mashaba. &ldquo;Another man, who was almost kidnapped and killed for his body parts, also came out in public to name the perpetrators. &ldquo;We tried to engage the police and even opened a case, but nothing has happened.&ldquo;What angered the community more was that the man who opened a case against the people who tried to kidnap him was then arrested for intimidating those suspects.&rdquo;Acornhoek acting station commander, Colonel Nicholas Ntiwane, signed the memorandum. Ntiwane said police were investigating the cases. He urged the residents to come forward with information about the suspects.
