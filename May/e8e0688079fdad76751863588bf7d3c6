TRADITIONAL leaders got a chance to share their concerns with government yesterday. Members of the Congress of Traditional Leaders of SA met ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and deputy traditional affairs minister Obed Bapela at Mthatha Town Hall, Eastern Cape.Contralesa has in the recent past that it felt sidelined and disempowered by government. Contralesa provincial chairman, chief Mwelo Nonkonyana, said for years they have raised concerns around land but government chooses to discuss land matters with municipal councils instead of them. &ldquo;Traditional leaders have no power. Our concerns are not heard, although we have made numerous submissions to the ANC,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Government now wants to take land away from kings and queens. That is why the ANC deemed it fit to put King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo in prison.&rdquo;Mkhize said: &ldquo;Traditional leaders are important. They work towards rural development. We will find ways to resolve these issues and move on.&rdquo;
