MASALENG residents can&rsquo;t bury their loved ones in peace or visit their graves. This is because the graveyard in Meqheleng, near Ficksburg, has a blocked sewerage drain. This causes shitty water to run all over the place. Residents say the municipality does not care about kasi people.But the municipality knows about the problem. It started in 2007 when the wrong drainpipes were installed.Sello Mohapi (38) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We live in a cursed area without basic human rights.&ldquo;Andries Tatane was killed fighting in this kasi over water and we&rsquo;ve had problems with sewage too. &ldquo;Our streets are flooded with the dirty water that is coming from the graveyard in Masaleng. &ldquo;I have seen municipal workers trying to fix the problem but there is no permanent solution.&rdquo;Ntsoaki Mosieleng (40) says she is worried about her eight-year-old niece who attends school near the leakage.Ntsoaki said: &ldquo;My sister&rsquo;s daughter goes to St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary. She and other pupils have to walk past the sewage. &ldquo;The place stinks badly and could harm our children&rsquo;s health. &ldquo;We cannot even attend funerals because the sewage overflows into the graveyard. &ldquo;It is difficult for families to visit their loved ones who have been buried there.&rdquo;Jonas Mohapang posted a photo of the sewage on Facebook and wrote: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think if this was happening in town it would have lasted more than an hour.&rdquo; Tshepiso Ramakarane, the manager of Setsoto Municipality, said they are aware of the manhole that keeps on leaking sewage into the graveyard.He said: &ldquo;In 2007 small pipes were installed and the design was wrong. The manhole keeps on getting blocked and our workers keep on unblocking it. &ldquo;It is a continuous problem. &ldquo;We have reported the matter to the national office of water and sanitation and they have appointed a company that will hopefully fix the problem.&rdquo;
