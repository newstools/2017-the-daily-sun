FARMERS are used to being plagued by stock theft.But residents of Makahlule Village, outside Malamulele in Limpopo, have an even bigger problem.Their cattle are being hunted down by hungry lions!Unemployed single mum Mphemphu Hlungwani said she depends on her livestock to support her family of six. But she keeps losing her cattle, she believes to lions.On Tuesday morning she found yet another of her cows killed just a kilometre from the village. Mphemphu (55) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My cow didn&rsquo;t return to the kraal on Monday evening so I went to the bush to look for it on Tuesday morning. &ldquo;I had barely walked a kilometre when I found my cow lying on the grass.&rdquo; Mphemphu said she reported the incident to the Kruger Park rangers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m appealing to the rangers to hunt these lions down before they kill all my livestock.&rdquo; Another victim, Gezani Chauke (50), said he lost one of his cows last Saturday.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost count of the stock that I&rsquo;ve lost to predators so far.&rdquo; The affected villages include Makuleke, Kavele, Magona, Mtititi, Govhu, Josefa, Qaza and Matiyani. Thomas Chauke of SA Wildlife Trade said: &ldquo;We encourage farmers to make sure that their livestock are locked in their kraals at sunset until the lions are captured.&rdquo;Kruger Park spokesman William Mabasa told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We advise community members to inform our rangers in Punda Maria if they see lions roaming outside the park. &ldquo;Lions are very dangerous and people should be extremely careful.&rdquo;
