MINA Shezi used to be proud of her son, but these days he sends chills down her spine. The worried mum often comes home to find her son has been sprinkling muthi around the house &ndash; and she hears him praying in a strange language! Mina told Daily Sun her son, Khotso (21) prays with red and white candles in his room and has even sprinkled muthi on her bed. She said whenever she and her husband return from work to find muthi around the house, they feel terrified. The mum from Buhle Park, near Germiston in Ekurhuleni, said she did not know where to get help. &ldquo;Last Wednesday I came home to find muthi on our bed and on the floor. When I asked Khotso what he had done, he just became aggressive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He threatens to harm us and we live in fear.&rdquo;Mina told the People&rsquo;s Paper she and her husband had visited prophets and churches, but they have not been able to help. &ldquo;I asked Khotso why he uses red and white candles and he said the candles help him to connect with God.&ldquo;He was an electrical engineering student, but he no longer goes to college,&rdquo; she said. Khotso said he did not like his parents interfering in his affairs.He said he performed rituals to strengthen their home. &ldquo;My religion is directing me to perform these rituals and I have to do as I am directed,&rdquo; he said. When the SunTeam asked him what religion he followed, he just said: &ldquo;We live in a democratic country where everyone has a right to choose their religion.&rdquo;
