THE woman convicted of killing her husband will wait another two weeks to hear if the court will show her any mercy.Noluthando Baleni appeared briefly in the Mthatha High Court yesterday.Her case was postponed because the presiding judge, Richard Brooks, was not available.State prosecutor Nomapha Mvandaba requested that the case be postponed until the judge was available.The mum of four was her usual smart self, sporting a different hairstyle from the one for her court appearance last month.She shocked many when she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to murder and murder charges relating to the October 2015 death of her estranged husband, Kholisile Baleni.The two were said to be finalising their divorce when the deputy school principal was shot dead at close range in his car.Following Noluthando&rsquo;s detailed confession, Judge Brooks convicted her of the charges.The process around her sentencing has been delayed often. Nosakhiwo Ngxaza, the social worker allocated to assess Noluthando&rsquo;s personal circumstances, did not provide all the information needed by the court.Brooks ordered Ngxaza to get more details, particularly those relating to Noluthando&rsquo;s financial standing. In March this year, 20-year-old Bonga Skolpati was convicted and sentenced for pulling the trigger and killing Baleni.Skolpati, with Noluthando and her father, Reverend Oliver Mgutyana (69), were arrested in February last year. However, Mgutyana was acquitted on all charges because of a lack of evidence linking him to the killing. Noluthando claimed that a young traditional healer known as Khayalethu Makhubalo approached her and said he had been hired by Baleni to kill her.The two allegedly ended up having an affair and planned the murder of her husband instead. She claimed she also bought a car for Khayalethu, who died in a car accident last year.Noluthando is due back in court on 29 May.
