The deaths occurred at Tintswalo Hospital, which has registered the highest number of malaria cases in the Bushbuckridge area between April and May this year. Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: &ldquo;During April and May a total of 585 malaria cases have been reported in Mpumalanga. About 294 of the malaria cases have been reported in the Bushbuckridge area, and 235 of those are local transmissions. Only 59 are imported from neighbouring provinces and countries such as Mozambique and Zimbabwe, where malaria is endemic.&rdquo; Malamule said more cases were coming from Acornhoek, Welverdiend, Marite, Dum-phries and Seville villages. The public was advised that any person showing signs and symptoms of malaria should immediately visit a local health facility to be tested and treated. The symptoms include fever, headaches, cold shivers and hot sweats, muscle pain or general body pains, weakness, dizziness and loss of appetite.
