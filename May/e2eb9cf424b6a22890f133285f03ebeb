WORLD champion, Siviwe &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Soyizwapi, counts himself lucky to be part of the Springboks Sevens side that won the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series title.&nbsp;Soyizwapi, who debuted for South Africa at last season&rsquo;s tournament, had his first full season with the Blitzbokke, who won the series with a game to spare.The last time South Africa won the tournament was in the 2008/2009 season when coach Neil Powell was still a player.They had finished second in the last three seasons &ndash; to Fiji and New Zealand.The 25-year-old said it had been an honour for him to play a full season and help the team get the title.Said Soyizwapi: &ldquo;It was a huge experience for me. It was my first full season to play and my first start in the games. I always used to travel as a reserve and i finally got my chance this season.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot. It&rsquo;s a huge honour and a privilege to be part of the team that won the series.&rdquo;The former Southern Kings wing said although they were disappointed to lose the Cape Town leg of the series, they were still hopeful they would collect enough points to win the tournament.He said: &ldquo;It was disappointing to lose at home. You could see with the supporters and the media that they were disappointed that we didn&rsquo;t win our home tournament. But with Cape Town games being early in the year, we knew we still had a shot to accumulate points to win it.&rdquo;Powell had called up the likes of Selvyn Davids and Zain Davids, who are younger players to strengthen the team when the likes of Seabelo Senatla and Kwagga Smith chose to take a break from the Sevens to focus on the 15s rugby format.But Shakes, unlike his other teammates who will be competing in the normal format of the sport, will take a break to recharge his batteries for next season.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still not sure if I&rsquo;ll go and play some 15s,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve committed myself to the Sevens full-time.&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have a lengthy break,&rdquo; he added.
