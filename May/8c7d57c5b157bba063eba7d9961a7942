POOR organisation in defence and lack of killer instinct are the main reasons why South Africa&rsquo;s Under-20 failed to progress to the next round of the Fifa Youth World Cup in South Korea.Amajita are coming home after a disappointing performance in the World Cup where they only scored one goal and managed to get a single point out of a possible nine.&nbsp;This was a third World Cup appearance for Amajita and the most disastrous youth World Cup performance by South Africa.&nbsp;Thabo Senong&rsquo;s charges failed to make it past the first round after losing two of the three group stage matches. Amajita lost 2-1 to Japan in the opening fixture, it was then followed by 2-0 lost against Italy midweek.Senong&rsquo;s future with the national team is now hanging in the balance and he will know his fate once new Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter has made his decision.Yesterday, South American champions Uruguay confirmed Amajita&rsquo;s exit in the worldshowpiece when they held them to a goalless draw at Incheon Football Stadium.&nbsp;In past World Cups, Amajita managed to score at least more than three goals. Against Uruguay they were much better compared to midweek where they lost to Italy.&nbsp;The last time Amajita were part of the World Cup in Egypt 2009 managed to reach the Last 16 of the competition under coach Serame Letsoaka.&nbsp;This year&rsquo;s group failed to emulate the Class of 2009.&nbsp;Uruguay topped Group D with seven points and qualified for the next round of competition as they defeated Italy 1-0, Japan 2-0 and drew with South Africa.Meanwhile African champions Zambia cruised to the next round of the competition despite suffering a 1-0 defeat to Costa Rica yesterday.&nbsp;They topped their Group C with six points. So far Zambia is the only African continent that managed to progress to the last-16.Until now Ghana have been the only African team to have won the tournament in 2009.&nbsp;
