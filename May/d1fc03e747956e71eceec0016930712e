CALL Cash Paymaster Services about the recent R1bn profit posting.The Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini told Parliament today.Dlamini told MPs today that Parliament can summon CPS, after a media report revealed it made a R1bn profit from the last financial year on the social grants contract.The Constitutional Court made it clear in a ruling that CPS is in fact an arm of government when doing business with government.Due to this it has to account in the same manner, Dlamini told the portfolio committee on social development.Dlamini stuck to her guns by saying the CPS contract has always been kept at R16.44 per grant beneficiary over the proposed five-year term.According to the Social Development Department, it will as directed appoint an independent panel at the end of CPS' term to look into the financial implications of the contract and the handover.She admitted that the regulation governing beneficiary deductions has been abused.Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza told the committee that they could not account for CPS' profit on their side. Magwaza said they could only handle the financials when they received it from elsewhere, but a private company's profit was not in their hands.He said the one-year extended contract was ordered to have the exact same terms as the previous, unlawful contract.Dlamini also agreed that they need to speak up in order to restore confidence in the Sassa brand.Committee chairperson Rose Capa said the ability to call in CPS will definitely be examined. It was supported by ruling and opposition MPs.Sassa also updated the committee on its progress in talks with the Post Office.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/parliament-should-summon-cps-dlamini-20170531
