STREET vendor Sirena Mohapi says he is in severe pain after being beaten by police officers. The 53-year-old from Ivory Park, Joburg told Daily Sun he was devastated that the people who were supposed to protect him had left him with a bloody mouth, torn lip and bashed head on Saturday. &ldquo;I was at the corner where I sell fruit and vegetables when I was approached by three cops. &ldquo;They told me I was not supposed to be selling there. When I told them I had been doing it for 10 years without a problem, they said I needed to pay them R200 to keep working there. &ldquo;All hell broke loose when I refused.&ldquo;They threw my stock on the ground and said they would teach me a lesson. When I tried to protect myself they beat me.&rdquo;Daily Sun contacted Thabo Lerumo from the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, who said an assault case had been opened. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to investigate because the victim doesn&rsquo;t know the names of the officers who assaulted him. We need to check who was on duty during those hours,&rdquo; Lerumo said. &ldquo;It could be officials from a number of departments but we will see how we can assist.&rdquo;
