DRUGGED, CONFUSED and terrified, Hloni lay on the back seat of the car and sent a desperate, one word WhatsApp message.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; she asked her mentor and friend Melody Miya.&nbsp; WHILE MELODY TRIED ALL HE COULD, THE COPS DID NOTHING TO HELP. It was about 8pm when Bona Retsang and UJ FM Breakfast Shake Up presenter, Melody Miya, got a message from a 22-year-old woman only known as Hloni. Earlier yesterday, at about 6.40pm, she sent a message saying: &ldquo;I am so scared. I&rsquo;m in town and there is a GTI following me.&rdquo; Melody, not knowing if the message was real, asked for clarity. At 7.55pm he got the one-word message pleading for help. Melody now realised it was serious, but he did not know she had been kidnapped on the Nelson Mandela Bridge in Braamfontein, Joburg, and was being driven to GaRankuwa, Tshwane. Melody called for help from the police and the Crime Air Network and also took to his Twitter page. He tagged the @SAPoliceService, which did nothing. Speaking to Daily Sun, Melody said Hloni, a final-year student at Wits, was on her way home when she realised she was being followed. &ldquo;I got a WhatsApp text saying she thought she was being followed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to overreact, but when I called she did not answer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I gave the Crime Air Network her number and they managed to trace the phone and give me a location,&rdquo; said Melody.&nbsp; He waited for 20 minutes on the phone inorder to speak to Ga-Rankuwa cops. &ldquo;My two friends and I drove to Ga-Rankuwa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;While heading there we came across a police van in Parktown.&rdquo; Apparently the police in the van said the situation was not in their area.&nbsp; After a 20-minute wait on the line he managed to speak to Ga-Rankuwa cops. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the place where her phone had been located without backup, so we went straight to the police station.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the meantime, Hloni was battling to save her life. When the car stopped at a traffic light, she stumbled out of the car and ran into the yard of a nearby resident. This is where the police found her, and they took her to the police station. Melody said: &ldquo;We took her to the Dr George Mukhari Hospital, where she was treated and placed on a drip.&rdquo; Hloni told Melody that after she was abducted, the men in the car injected her with an unknown substance to keep her sedated.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me that the kidnappers were talking to their boss and they told him they had &lsquo;fresh meat&rsquo; for him,&rdquo; said Melody. At 11.44pm Melody was finally able to tweet: &ldquo;I found her. Thank you, Lord.&rdquo; Hloni was discharged from the hospital yesterday and she went home with her parents. Ga-Rankuwa SAPS confirmed that the incident took place on Tuesday evening. SAPS spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said they were following up on allegations of a student being kidnapped. &ldquo;The information was seen on social media and an interview conducted with UJFM. &ldquo;A case will be opened for investigation and to trace the suspects,&rdquo; said Dlamini.
