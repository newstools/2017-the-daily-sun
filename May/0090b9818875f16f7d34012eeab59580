RELATIVES of a mum who tried to burn her six kids to death before hanging herself believe she did it because she suspected her fiance was cheating. The 32-year-old mum from Esidinsi Village in Nongoma, northern KZN, killed herself on Saturday. A family member (55) told Daily Sun the woman &ndash; who cannot be named to protect the identities of her kids &ndash; thought her fiance was cheating on her because he didn&rsquo;t come home for the Easter holidays and had no real excuse. The mum poured paraffin in the house where her kids were sleeping and left a candle burning before going to another house where she hanged herself! The relative said she left a suicide note but didn&rsquo;t want to share its contents. The relative said the woman&rsquo;s 14-year-old daughter woke up when the fire started and rescued her younger siblings. &ldquo;She is in hospital in a critical condition while her younger siblings are recovering at home,&rdquo; said the relative. Another source said: &ldquo;They argued over the phone and we could tell she was very angry about her fiance&rsquo;s sudden change in behaviour.&rdquo; When the SunTeam contacted the fiance, he refused to talk about the matter. &ldquo;There is nothing I want to share with you. Please stay out of my affairs.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that an inquest docket was opened at Nongoma cop shop after a 32-year-old woman was found hanging in a house. &ldquo;Cops also found a suicide note on the scene. &ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated.&rdquo;
