AWARD-WINNING rapper, Refilwe &ldquo;Fifi Cooper&rdquo; Mooketsi, and her ex-boyfriend Notshi &ldquo;Killer Bee&rdquo; are rumoured to be at each other&rsquo;s throats.This after Fifi allegedly sent him messages bashing his new album. Notshi, real name Kabelo Oageng, and the first lady of Motswako broke up when she rose to fame.&nbsp;Notshi from Itsoseng, North West, is allegedly angry about SMSes and phone calls from Fifi, who says his album will fail.&nbsp;But Notshi denies this: &ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;m hearing about this. We don&rsquo;t talk at all. We don&rsquo;t have a good history. But that sounds like something she would say about me.&rdquo;&nbsp;A source sings another tune: &ldquo;When they were together, Notshi was about to break through into the hip hop scene, but he was busy supporting Fifi. As soon as she blew up, she forgot about him,&rdquo; said the source.The showbiz mole added: &ldquo;When Fifi was still finding her way in the music industry, Notshi was there for her. It&rsquo;s shocking that she&rsquo;s acting like this.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second source claims now that Notshi is putting all his energy into his work, Fifi starts texting and saying all this.&ldquo;Maybe she wants him back but is ashamed because of how they parted.&rdquo;Fifi said: &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not true. I haven&rsquo;t sent messages or called that person in a while. I don&rsquo;t know what you talking. Everyone knows I&rsquo;m Notshi&rsquo;s fan since way back.&rdquo;&nbsp;
