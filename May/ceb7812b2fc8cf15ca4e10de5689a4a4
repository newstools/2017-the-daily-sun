THE trial of a Limpopo man who allegedly killed his ex-girlfriend's son and dumped the boy's body in a bush is set to start today in the Limpopo High Court.Jimmy Makhubele was arrested in May after he allegedly killed Katlego Lesenya in May last year.It is alleged that he kidnapped Lesenya who was playing soccer with his friends, and made calls to the boy's mum about their broken relationship.At the time, residents blamed cops for the boy's murder because of their apparent slow response in tracking down Lesenya and arresting Makhubele.They alleged that after Makhubele made phone calls and promised to return the boy, police relaxed and failed to track his movements.Makhubele apparently repeatedly told police that he would bring the boy back.However, he failed to show up for more than three days and Lesenya's family approached senior police in the province for help.Lesenya's body was later found dumped in bushes near Lephalale.Makhubele allegedly led police to the scene hours after he was arrested.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/suspected-limpopo-child-murderer-in-court-20170508
