THEY say good things come in pairs, and top actor Mike Mvelase is no exception.&nbsp; This as public opinion suggests that the former Generations star, popularly known as Khaphela, has a twin.&nbsp; In fact, maskandi singer Khaphela Thusini has been said to be the spitting image of the actor by most people, especially those from Msinga in Umzinyathi, KwaZulu-Natal, from where both artists hail.&nbsp; Asked for comment, the maskandi musician said he only discovered in 2007 that he looked like Mike.&nbsp; Said Khaphela: &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m delighted to look like a celebrity, it was difficult for me at first. I&rsquo;d sometimes spend time indoors because people would mistake me for him.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to Khaphela, people from his community refused to accept that they were not twins.&nbsp; The musician said community members would even stare when the duo was at the Nazareth Baptist Church, of which they are members.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve never spoken to him despite the many rumours, endless speculation and fanfare about our &lsquo;identical looks&rsquo;,&rdquo; Khaphela said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose us being similar in structure, height and in how we talk was really what kick-started the rumour mill.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Khaphela, also a music promoter, said looking like Mike had its perks.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessing because many people who see my posters think they&rsquo;ll meet the star on stage,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;During events, people ask to take photos with me and also request autographs. Whenever I try to explain who I am, they always assume I&rsquo;m lying about my identity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Khaphela, who now lives in Tembisa, east of Jozi, is married to three wives and has nine children. He wishes to meet the actor one day &ndash; and even spend time together.&nbsp; An irritated Mike, on the other hand, seemed less thrilled when asked about having a twin bother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a twin brother, and I&rsquo;ve never had a twin brother,&rdquo; Mike said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look, Khaphela Ngcobo was my stage name on Generations. I can&rsquo;t really say much about him looking like me. Besides, you are disturbing me &ndash; I have other things to do.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&thinsp;Thusini will host the Sivundulula Ikhono event at eSiqongweni Sports Ground in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on 4 June from 9am till late. Tickets are available for R25 at the door.&nbsp; Some of the musicians on the line-up include Buselaphi, Thokozani Langa, Shilisi and Ezeqhawe Lembazo, among others.&nbsp;
