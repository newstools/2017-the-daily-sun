THESE men drive around the squatter camp in flashy cars, promising women office jobs. The women are then taken to an &ldquo;office&rdquo; to sort out the details. But apparently the place turned out to be more of a place to poke than an office! Last week, two Zandspruit women were allegedly kidnapped and found the &ldquo;office&rdquo; to be a room on a Honeydew plot.&ldquo;It looked as if they were going to sell us,&rdquo; they said. They were locked inside a room containing a bed, mealie- meal and a bottle of fish oil. &ldquo;We became suspicious as it looked nothing like an office. It seemed something evil was going on. &ldquo;We found another girl from Soweto who told us she was recruited for an office job.&rdquo;They said a man pushed the lever down to lock the door. &ldquo;He was gone close to 30 minutes when we managed to open it and fled. The girl we found there went to the gate to ask security to open.&rdquo; The women say the man was captured, but when people wanted to burn him alive, community leaders intervened.Community leader Kenneth Lekalakala said they took the man to Honeydew Police Station.&ldquo;He was questioned and released. The police said there was no evidence.&rdquo;The women are worried as the man is still roaming the squatter camp, probably still scouting for women.Captain Balan Muthan said a case will be opened so the place can be raided.
