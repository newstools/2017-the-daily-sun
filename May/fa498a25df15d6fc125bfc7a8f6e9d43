A SUPPOSED ransom demand over missing Elsie's River 3-year-old Courtney Pieters turned out to be a prank.''It was children who were playing,'' said an angry family spokeswoman, Celeste Adonis, to whose phone the message was sent.The community and police have looked for the child for over a week since she disappeared from near their home on the morning of 4 May.According to the Daily Voice, R35 000 was demanded from Courtney's family for information on her whereabouts.Mom Juanita Pieters and father Aaron Fourie and their other two children have been waiting since last Thursday for Courtney to come home.They have already ruled out two possible sightings of their child, with the help of CCTV footage provided by cops.She was last seen at the corner of Milky Way and Grand Vue Drive wearing a yellow and white top and blue shorts.Pieters said she was very worried about her daughter, and battled to sleep, but counselling was helping her get through each day.Tomorrow, their neighbours are planning to form a big search group to walk through the area yet again to see if they can find any clues that will lead them to the child.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/pranksters-send-ransom-demand-to-missing-courtneys-family-20170512
