THE father of a two-week-old baby that died at around the same time that a protest was taking place blames the police . . . The sad, angry Receive Khoza (29) has demanded that the KZN Community Safety and Liaison Department owns up by burying his son! He believes Jayden died as a direct result of cops’ decision to fire teargas at protesters. It happened in Foreman Road squatter camp in Sydenham, Durban, on Monday. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsser5LLl_QJg_6lAqrLGNsOauZS2TeJDfiS0pOlYLgehJGREowT_Ic_7sJp0d7oK4xoKhwGxWBD_S1pSxifopXo7OmV5hKkJigUHo4XBe3NTpzb6lQn0MbqEgxOfXrRj6XgbVsh73HQRlnoljYQH2cLtUpAdLSkGzjxFBMxJ2QWZuy-Our5O01dah06Xstyheg-vINTiR3GJ1eakW3FDK6txRJqekmot9J5CHoCv6L27n6Ao8CXTJiJ43jv3nlx2iF2pBmooY_3jvqf4aZHABmIy3V4puU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzK1DtOK33EKHEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I demand that they pay funeral costs. If they had not fired teargas, my son would be alive.” He said: “We were inside the shack during the protest when the baby suddenly struggled to breathe.“We called an ambulance, but paramedics declared him dead when they arrived. The police called a mortuary van and told us they would conduct a post mortem.” He wanted to bury Jayden in his home province of Mpumalanga but didn’t have money to transport the body. Councillor Mohammed Hanif said police were handling the matter. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: “An inquest docket has been opened. Residents were protesting illegally and the cops were on the scene to calm the situation.” The cause of death was unknown, but a post mortem would be conducted to find out what killed the baby.
