TWO deadly snakes slithered into bedridden gogo Khulukazi Mdayi&rsquo;s RDP, coiled themselves around her and bit her on Saturday! The 69-year-old from Chris Hani in KwaNobuhle, Nelson Mandela Bay, died hours after being bitten. Since the horrific incident, residents of the kasi have been living in fear of the evil snakes. The gogo&rsquo;s nephew, Thozi Lolwana (50), said after his aunt died, residents sprinkled diesel around their yards, which are metres away from thick bush. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to live without fear in this area.&rdquo; Thozi said neighbours rushed to help his aunt after hearing horrible screams coming from her house. &ldquo;When they got there they saw two snakes coiled around my aunt&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;One was black and the other was brown,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They threw objects including vegetables at the snakes, which had slithered under my aunt&rsquo;s blankets. The black snake was clinging to her shoulders and the brown one to her leg.&ldquo;The brown snake was biting into a wound she had on her right leg. After neighbours dragged my aunt out of her room, they killed the black snake but the other one disappeared.&rdquo; Thozi said gogo Khulukazi died at Uitenhage Hospital the same day. He said on Sunday, a day after his aunt died, a swarm of bees came buzzing into the gogo&rsquo;s RDP. &ldquo;They camped outside the room where she was bitten by the snakes. We are planning to visit a sangoma to get opinions on these events. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusual for two snakes to slither into your blankets and kill you.&rdquo; Thozi said the gogo, who attended the Reformed Holy Church in Zion, would be buried on Saturday. Sangoma Lifa &ldquo;Khandiyeza&rdquo; Noda said the bees were a good sign and that someone in the family will be rich. &ldquo;Two snakes are usually sent to kill an old family member who is a woman. Those who saw the brown snake were unable to hit it because it is a snake of ukuthwala.&rdquo;
