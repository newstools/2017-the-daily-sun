KWAITO legend Eugene Mthethwa of Trompies fame has a bone to pick with ANC chief whip Mathole Motshekga.He claims Mathole stopped his proposed national dialogue &ndash; meant to address the non-existence of the rainbow nation &ndash; in 2012.Taking to social media to vent, Eugene &ndash; on his Facebook page &ndash; posted: &ldquo;I wish Cde Mathole Motshekga could admit his blunder for stopping the national dialogue I had proposed after discussing [the idea] with the president." "Now, five years down the line, the former presidents are calling for a national dialogue. Visionary leadership dololo (lacking).&rdquo;Eugene&rsquo;s frustration was prompted by a national dialogue that was held on Friday, chaired by former presidents FW de Klerk, Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe.A disappointed Eugene told the SunTeam: &ldquo;The president was in favour of this idea and gave me his blessing. This would&rsquo;ve helped us find ourselves as Africans. &ldquo;But Mathole didn&rsquo;t like the idea." "He just cancelled it just as it was about to start. I know he will never apologise for cancelling it, but I know his conscious will deal with him.&nbsp;&ldquo;All I really wanted was to remind him of the blunder he made back in 2012.&rdquo;In response, Mathole said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his opinion. Who am I to stop a national dialogue? If he thinks that I&rsquo;m living in my own world, that is his own opinion.&rdquo;&ldquo;I used to work at the president&rsquo;s office, as the stakeholders&rsquo; relation. I observed that previous presidents Dr Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki had left their legacy.&nbsp;&ldquo;I then confronted our president and asked him what will be his legacy? He told me he wasn&rsquo;t sure. I then proposed that since he was a traditionalist, we needed a national dialogue. I explained to him that South Africans claim to have a rainbow nation, but that it was non-existent. He loved it and gave me his blessing.&ldquo;This would&rsquo;ve helped us find ourselves as Africans.&ldquo;Mathole didn&rsquo;t like the idea. He just cancelled it before the breakfast event was held. I know he is that type of person who doesn&rsquo;t like anything that involves religion. "Mathole will never apologize for cancelling it but I know that his conscious will deal with him. Whether he apologizes or not its up to him. All I wanted is to remind him of the blunder he made in 2012. "The national dialogue was going to be about the morals, values and norms,&rdquo; he said. People don&rsquo;t know that the president is surrounded by wolves in sheep skin,&rdquo; he said.Motshekga said: &ldquo;That is his opinion. Who am I to stop a national dialogue? If he thinks that I&rsquo;m living in my own world, that is his own opinion. I&rsquo;m entitled&rdquo;
