FURIOUS squatters took to the streets on Tuesday after some of their shacks were demolished. Public order cops fired rubber bullets at protesters in Florida, Joburg after they barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks. About 100 families had been occupying a vacant piece of land in the area for six months and refused to move when the Metro cops arrived to evict them. Most of them ended up staying as the Metro police suspended the operation because there were not enough cops. Community leader Wilson Mawete told Daily Sun the law did not allow for anyone to be evicted if they had been living in a place for more than 48 hours. &ldquo;We have been here for six months now and the issue is with the court.&ldquo;Without any court order or ruling, no one has the right to demolish our shacks,&rdquo; said Wilson.Joburg Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar confirmed the operation was suspended. &ldquo;If anyone wants to live on a piece of land they must rent or buy it.&ldquo;We will continue the operation soon,&rdquo; he warned.
