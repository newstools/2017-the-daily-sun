WHEN Edward Tsotetsi’s four-year-old daughter went missing a month ago he consulted sangomas, who told him she would come home alive. But on Tuesday, little Pontsho’s remains were found by cow herders in the bush! The 54-year-old father from Mokgoba in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni was able to identify his daughter’s body as she was still wearing the clothes she had on when she went missing. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstLt9HTBfO6MbWQyZgbAcqyQBYmlIcLpYIMJ44sxVTqU3wHjfQmX7WrzAKrwd1VE7OuoDQBJk1_U1mprIBUYHw_rH43PlU4hZBAcBCE_t40KUHKkFHGxmPCyTZ52GNnmYYkMtqEaH-vqV6vM20_h7hOl53zVWujcTVHHM9sUGaYtDHDEfNCpUvmLxIGKCM-ZOVFt_gC4Wqo0AmV0n3GNvloeJXmsS0MtYsWHmBIj2Ue7veVTb-Oe4kBJbUD_hwmrGnienfx7SWeaDvN4rUfpfKLhagKY0k\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCCiVBktnFJ6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

To make matters worse, he has given all his money to sangomas and has nothing to bury his daughter with.Edward said Pontsho went missing last month while playing in front of his house with other kids. “None of the other kids noticed she was gone. We only discovered she was missing when her mum went to check on her. “We are relieved we found her remains but we are appealing to the public to help us bury her.”Resident Mpumi Zwane said the herders told her when they found the remains and she went to check. “I was shattered when I saw from the clothes she was wearing that it was Pontsho. “We looked for her in hospitals and mortuaries but she was nowhere to be found. We never thought it would turn out like this.” Police spokesman Captain Ramothakhi Maqabe said the remains were taken for forensic testing. Cops were not sure how she was killed.
