PEOPLE in his village said Maime Petje (52) is going crazy and getting into fights with everyone.But he said he&rsquo;s not losing his grip on reality &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that someone who is jealous of his new two-roomed extension is making his life hell.His family is allegedly tormented by a tokoloshe that jumps on their house at night and loosens the nails of the new extension.Maime, from Jiyane Village outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo, said his torment started a year ago after he extended his house.&ldquo;The noise sounded like a hammer hitting the corrugated iron. &ldquo;The next day I climbed on the roof and was shocked to find all the nails loose.&rdquo;The father of four said he had no explanation other than it must be the work of a tokoloshe. He was unable to find any footprints.&ldquo;The person doing this is invisible. &ldquo;I sometimes wake up at night to check in the hope of seeing who is doing this, but I don&rsquo;t see a thing. &ldquo;The noise stops for a while, but as soon as I get back into bed, it starts again,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.He said he no longer sleeps in his bedroom but in the sitting-room as the noise there seems less.He said his situation was once raised at church and the pastors prayed for him, but nothing changed.Kedibone Thamaga from the village said she suspects Maime is no longer well in the head. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fighting with everyone he suspects of causing the noise,&rdquo; she said.
