TO the north is a coal mine that is churning out hundreds of tons of coal a day, and on the other side are boreholes and sand excavations.&nbsp; In the middle are the owners of the land, who live in shacks and mud houses.&nbsp; They should be rich, yet only a handful of them even own a car, let alone a decent dwelling.&nbsp; These are the residents of Nkomeni, near Evander in Mpumalanga. They are the owners of just over 342&thinsp;hectares of land, following the handing of the farm back to the community in 2005.&nbsp; Sasol has been paying them R291&thinsp;291,50 a year since 2010 to operate a mine on their land, as well as several thousand rands each month for leases on a number of boreholes. The Sakhisizwe Communal Property Association, chaired by Steve Shabangu, is supposed to represent the 48 families who make up the community.&nbsp; Resident Mbulelo Vilakazi (35) claimed they had not seen a cent of the money the association has generated over the years.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never tells the residents anything unless he needs signatures for another scheme he is working on,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;This land is rich in coal. Sasol is mining it. They also lease parts of the farm for boreholes and have been paying between R3&thinsp;000 to R5&thinsp;000 a month for the past nine years.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mine alone has been in operation for six years now, which means more than R1,7&thinsp;million has been paid to us. We have not seen that money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sasol spokeswoman Matebello Motloung confirmed that the company had been liaising with a Mr S Shabangu and Mr SP Ndlovu, who were mandated by the community. Shabangu said: &ldquo;We used the money to install water taps and fence the entire farm, but the same people complaining have now vandalised these things.&nbsp; &ldquo;They also stole tractors and sold them and refuse to do agricultural work.&rdquo; Shabangu said an AGM was held this year at which he was re-elected as chairman, a claim denied by residents.
