She claimed to have run away from an evil stepmum.She soon met the father of her children, but later left him. &ldquo;I wanted to hurt him, so I took my kids with me. Now I can&rsquo;t find him and this is affecting my kids,&rdquo; she said.Bukiwe has two girls, Nosisa Tshabalala (18) and Vezukuhle Tshabalala (16). Her son Qondisani Tshabalala (27) works for a construction company.Bukiwe said Nosisa is writing her matric exams this year, while Vezukuhle is in grade 11. Bukiwe said: &ldquo;What makes the situation worse is that I also don&rsquo;t have an ID. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to apply for an ID since 2006, but with no luck. I love my kids and want the best for them.&rdquo; Thabo Mokgola, a spokesman for Home Affairs, said the matter has been referred to Pearl Pota, their office manager in Soweto. &ldquo;If the family qualifies to have Mzansi IDs, they&rsquo;ll get the help they need.&rdquo;
