SCHOOLING at Topaz Secondary School in Lenasia, south of Joburg, has ground to a halt.Teachers embarked on a peaceful protest on Wednesday against their principal. The teachers said the principal disrespected them and misused the school&rsquo;s money. They claimed the school&rsquo;s academic performance had got worse since he arrived in 2010.When Daily Sun visited the school yesterday during school hours, pupils were seen outside class. While some were playing football, some snoozed under the trees while others were seen sitting in twos, fondling and kissing.Teachers said they wouldn&rsquo;t start teaching again until their complaints were heard. They said they wanted the principal to be investigated. &ldquo;He does as he pleases. He doesn&rsquo;t respect us. When he speaks to a teacher, you&rsquo;d swear he was speaking to a two-year-old,&rdquo; said one teacher. &ldquo;Since his arrival the school&rsquo;s matric results have dropped drastically. The department needs to do something urgently,&rdquo; said one woman teacher. Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said: &ldquo;We have requested officials from head office and the district to visit the school and meet the protesting teachers. &ldquo;We need to stabilisethe situation and ensure that teaching and learning resume as soon as possible.&rdquo;
