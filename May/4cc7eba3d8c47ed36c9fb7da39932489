SERVICE delivery protests flared up yesterday, this time making Diepkloof, Soweto a nightmare for motorists.Major routes such as Chris Hani Road and the Soweto Highway were blocked by burning tyres and rubbish.The police fired rubber bullets, stun grenades and teargas to disperse protesters who had allegedly stoned cars.The protesters also caused chaos at Bara Taxi Rank and vowed to protest until their demand for houses was addressed by human settlements MEC Paul Mashatile.Mashatile&rsquo;s spokesman, Keith Khoza, said the MEC was not available as he was in Etwatwa in Ekurhuleni, where he was handing out title deeds.Khoza said the right approach for the community was to have a memorandum ready and to elect a representative to take it to Mashatile&rsquo;s office.&ldquo;The MEC will respond to it,&rdquo; Khoza said.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said motorists whose cars were damaged should go to a police station and open a case of malicious damage to property.&ldquo;The cops are investigating a case of public violence. No arrests have been made,&rdquo; Makhubele said.In Pimville, residents took to the streets over electricity. They were outraged by constant power cuts in the area.Traffic was smooth in Lawley but roads were still littered with the burnt remains of an overnight protest for electricity.
