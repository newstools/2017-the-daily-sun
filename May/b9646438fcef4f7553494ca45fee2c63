A-LIST celeb Brenda Ngxoli has swapped city life for the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; that comes with farm ownership.&nbsp;&ldquo;People can say what they like, but I don&rsquo;t owe any bank here.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve built my home from scratch and, for me to work in Jozi while I&rsquo;m here at home, is great.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s peaceful and financially stable,&rdquo; the internationally-acclaimed actress, nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007.&ldquo;Look, you can stay in Sandton and live that posh life.&nbsp;&ldquo;But when you lose your job and can&rsquo;t pay your bills, the bank will repossess its cars and houses. I don&rsquo;t want that.&rdquo;The renowned Eastern Cape-born actress, who&rsquo;s starred in several local dramas and played Vuyo in the SABC1 telenova Home Affairs, said she really wanted to give rural life a &ldquo;good&rdquo; go.Brenda hoped her recent move back to Tsomo in the Eastern Cape would inspire young people to consider investing their hard-earned money in farms.Said Brenda: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to invest here than in big cities.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only is there ample space, but you get to enjoy your privacy.&ldquo;I love it here. I&rsquo;m at peace. In fact, this year alone, I haven&rsquo;t bothered to buy meat.&nbsp;&ldquo;If I want some, I slaughter a cow, goat or a chicken. I have it all!&ldquo;I have big land to plant and have learnt a lot in a small space of time about farming.&nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, I don&rsquo;t like to call it farming, but prefer to refer to it as sustainable living and homesteading.&ldquo;I do everything I want here, without having to worry about owing some bank or landlord.&rdquo;According to Brenda, big cities were designed to put pressure on rural people to go to them, so they would empower owners.&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t believe in that system,&rdquo; she said.
