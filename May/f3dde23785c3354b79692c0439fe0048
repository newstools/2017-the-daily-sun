While some held up the store owner at gunpoint, demanding cash, others were moving up and down outside the shop, checking the coast was clear. In the end they managed to get away with about R70 000 in cash and booze. Rossouw said as they entered the store, cops going into the shop to buy airtime were alerted by workers to the robbery in progress. &ldquo;The cops observed the situation and then confronted the two suspicious looking men who were roaming around the shop,&rdquo; said Rossouw. He said one cop was shot in his left thigh and his state gun taken by the thugs. A mother and child and two other adults were almost shot in the crossfire. He said during the confrontation, more men came running out of the store carrying boxes containing money and booze.
