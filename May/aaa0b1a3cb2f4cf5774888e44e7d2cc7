ANGRY parents at a primary school in Richards Bay, north of KZN have expressed anger over the behaviour of teachers at the school. Video footage showed a teacher slapping a grade 7 pupil repeatedly on the face in front of other pupils in class. The video, which hit social media platforms towards the end of last week, has evoked widespread anger. One parent (34) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;One of my twins who is now in grade 8 at another school was beaten badly by two different teachers at this school while still in grade 3. &ldquo;I went to the school to inquire about it but nothing was done. &ldquo;I found out about the incident when I sat down with the twin sister of the victim. &ldquo;She told me that the teacher slapped her twin several times in class.&rdquo; The current video, which is very brief, has chalked up about 2 258 views on YouTube. The teacher is heard shouting: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your problem? &ldquo;My girl you&rsquo;re wearing even takkies this day. &ldquo;Empty-headed,&rdquo; before she slaps the pupil hard across the face. KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said the department condemned the act in the strongest possible terms. &ldquo;We are going to send a team of investigators to find out more about these allegations and then take a decision based on our findings,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.
