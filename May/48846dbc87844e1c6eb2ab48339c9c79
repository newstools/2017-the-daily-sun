&ldquo;WE NEED service delivery, not this rubbish.&rdquo;These are the angry words of New Brighton residents in Port Elizabeth who have been waiting since last February for work on Sangotsha Street to be finished. In that time it has turned into a filthy, muddy place.Resident Silumko Dladla (67) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We live like pigs because the municipality did a half job.&ldquo;We have been waiting for our road to be tarred since last February, but the contractors left it incomplete without telling us what the problem was.&ldquo;When it rains, we are like pigs because we walk in mud, and when it is windy the dust rises high and is a health hazard. &ldquo;When it is dry this place becomes dusty.&ldquo;It is unacceptable for the municipality to take two years to develop an area with only nine streets. They finished only three streets and that is a disgrace,&rdquo; he said.Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We were not aware of the problem, but we will investigate it.&rdquo;
