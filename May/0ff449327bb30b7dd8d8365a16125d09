BONGI Mngomezulu, who is also known as Bravo the acrobat entertainer, is looking for help to fulfil his dream.&ldquo;I was invited to one of the world&rsquo;s biggest street festivals taking place in Scotland in August.&ldquo;I need R35 000 for food, transport and accommodation. &ldquo;I hope to find a sponsor,&rdquo; said Bravo.The SunTeam caught up with him at his usual spot, the V&amp;A Waterfront in Cape Town, where he was surrounded by locals and tourists amazed by his acts. He lifts a wheelbarrow in the air with his hands before balancing it on a stick tightly gripped in his teeth!&ldquo;This is not magic. &ldquo;It requires years of training,&rdquo; he said.Bravo said he recently represented South Africa at a festival in Dubai and hoped to represent the country in Scotland. Bravo started performing 18 years ago and has gone to various countries in Africa and overseas. The father of two daughters told Daily Sun that the money he makes from performing has helped him look after himself and his family.He adds jokes to his performances so his audience puts more money in his box. Bravo said he hoped a generous sponsor would fund him so that he could make Mzansi proud.
