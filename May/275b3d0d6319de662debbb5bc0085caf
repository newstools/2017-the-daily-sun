THE use of religion in schools will be the order of the day
this morning when the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools
(Fedsas) and the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD) face-off
in court.According to Fedsas CEO Paul Colditz, many South Africans
are religious people who want to exercise their freedoms.OGOD's chairperson Hans Pieterson says he doesn't have an
issue with religion but has a problem with public schools using government
funds to actively promote evangelical or schools imposing a dominant religious culture
over another.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvtEWbZNitO3pcnLJ2o0QTFmuQGyK0em7lRrtGGW2Th6uQ0IBir_7bBLkaeZ6dQbuoN_h5GZ4FAwmEV3gzB2p9M3_J30CPyLslTIWXx3kvr9o5tmrUugGAxB0x0By6m5yhRi0XHhBxpDKDEySseZarc4lczv_nGhtgq7kHLCI4hKhmpLy4_-o6yd8kbR7v3TV8jH1aK7WRdmVn8KYrJqmxx6skVvG2AthFKLZcOzFMDneF7tJDKYAmeE5nsGb2parn_V5Y062v_xyzBSpEPPPJfI8P3CTo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzB4q4ZfpI7JoEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

that the opportunity be given to everybody involved in the school to practice their
religion of choice."South Africa doesnâ€™t have an established clause that
has strict separation between church and the country, like the United
States" said Colditz. AfriForum will have its legal team present as a friend of
the court in favour of a religious culture in schools, the organisation says it
has committed itself to assist schools facing such legal issues.In 2015 AfriForum initiated a campaign to keep religion in
schools to raise awareness and support around the case.The South African Constitution specifically makes provision
for freedom of religion which means freedom of religion in private and public
spaces.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/fedsas-prepares-to-square-off-with-ogod-over-religious-ethos-in-schools-20170515
