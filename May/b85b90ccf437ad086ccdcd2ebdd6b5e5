BEING a pastor goes hand in hand with being parliamentary secretary, because both roles are about serving people.National Assembly secretary Masibulele Xaso said: &ldquo;Pastoral work is all about people, and parliament belongs to the people. The same applies to the church environment and parliament. &ldquo;It is always about what is best for the people.&rdquo; When not dealing with politicians, issues such as the no confidence vote or working with speaker Baleka Mbete, he takes on his other role.Xaso exchanges parliament&rsquo;s rule book with the Bible to serve as the founder and senior pastor of Christian Worship Centre headquarters in Mandela Park, Khayelitsha.The centre was founded 16 years ago and now it has spread throughout Western Cape, with branches in Gauteng and Eastern Cape.Xaso started spreading the word of God in 2001 and he has worked in parliament for more than 21 years.He said there is no contradiction between the two roles as he needs to be highly ethical, both in parliament and in church.&ldquo;These two roles complement each other. The two keep me in a straight line in whatever I do. The combination is good. &ldquo;I am not a politician. I am an official who serves all parties equally. I must be objective. The fact that I am a person of faith carries me wherever I am. I always have hope and faith in everything, even if we face difficult situations,&rdquo; Xaso said.
