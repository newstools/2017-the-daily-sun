PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma yesterday faced another motion of no confidence from members of the ANC’s NEC. The previous attempt, some six months ago, saw Zuma going nowhere. Minister Derek Hanekom, who tabled the motion, was soon dumped with others, including Minister Pravin Gordhan, in a Cabinet reshuffle on 31 March. This time the motion was tabled by NEC member Joel Netshitenzhe. He was said to have been supported by, among others, Hanekom, Gauteng ANC chairman Paul Mashatile and Gauteng ANC secretary Hope Papo, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and his deputy, Joe Phaahla.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvL1Y0AK5vh0JKClcur7jbGDgyAeVGGa1S9Fx0i4zn2IWOisa9p_QP3Tf-0dTH3MIPjcGR4A5zU10UFf2S9gQL6bckBxLYBqf9YlNwbHD952E6o-VdIlkJjXL26THIwUQxlEYkzsddrgHEjQ5izV8t_aDTB5b1Q32bIf082QdDDE-4rtd70ojEWmlIaI9HR4Ih3y6bR__B4Jh5iZnw3irsTkoKM_YgnKiUcONpfEidaT0V_zjqoXGVzB5olE0RRF-Rp5Vqz2Ai1F6gRxtT61VVGIMcqs0U\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDM_1cEBIHMcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A week ago, the South African Council of Churches said the country was inches away from becoming a mafia state. The council said it had lost confidence in the ANC. Zuma’s supporters argued that removing Zuma now would play into the hands of opposition parties. ANC stalwarts and veterans wrote a letter to NEC members before this weekend’s meeting, pleading for the removal of all those who are party to state capture.
