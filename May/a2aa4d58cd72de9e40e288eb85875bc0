SOME of the karatekas said they felt as if they were being struck by lightning each time a kick landed on their faces! Some of the young men who took part in a karate tournament at the weekend claim their opponents used muthi against them. The Meibukan karate tournament, held on Saturday at Jeff Masemola Hall at Kwanobuhle kasi in Uitenhage, involved just over 13 clubs and about 10 black belts. The tournament was brutal, with many walking away with swollen faces and blood coming out of their mouths. Apparently, some participants even fell to the floor, even though their opponents had not laid a finger on them . . . Sensei Xolisile Netnout, who organised the tournament, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;What we know is that one of the karatekas, who is a black belt, uses muthi. &ldquo;He often wears iintsimbi like a sangoma, and it smells of muthi. He claims he wears them as part of his culture.&rdquo; One of the karatekas who claimed muthi was being used, Masixole Blou (22), said: &ldquo;I think one of the fighters used muthi against me, but I won the fight.&rdquo; But his sensei, Wilson Fiyani (53), said: &ldquo;All I can say is that the tournament was well organised &ndash; muthi or no muthi. I had five fighters. Three won and two lost.&rdquo;
