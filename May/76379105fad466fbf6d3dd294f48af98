MUSICIAN Alek Blak has thrown all manner of restraint out the window and finally made his presence felt.This as the self-taught guitarist, pianist and songwriter&rsquo;s alter ego broke out of the creative&rsquo;s dreary journo persona &ndash; known for his stellar work in the Destiny Man magazine.And an excited Alek (real name Yamkela Mdaka) said he was ready to claim his spot among the stars. A mood he exuded in his optimism about prospects of his budding music career, following the release of his much-anticipated single, New Day, this week.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any one person was born to live for only one passion,&rdquo; Alek told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;I have two. So, why can&rsquo;t I express them both?&rdquo;According to the artist, his song was something fresh, raw and emotional.&ldquo;I wrote the song after realising I&rsquo;d been stuck in negative emotion for a very long time,&rdquo; Alek said.&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s true that time heals all wounds, it had gotten to a point where I needed to give time a hand by contributing toward my emotional recovery.&rdquo;And when he realised this, Alek said that&rsquo;s when it dawned on him that every new day was an opportunity to start afresh.&ldquo;It was a chance to forget my pain and move on, let go of the things I couldn&rsquo;t change and, as my chorus so emphatically points out, to find new ways to make the sun shine.&rdquo;He said the song took him only 15 minutes to write because there was very little he needed to think about.&ldquo;I knew what I wanted to say, so I wrote a song to ensure that I remembered my conviction,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been inspired by left-field artists the likes of Lauryn Hill as a songwriter.&ldquo;My surroundings, the world and the special people in my life also play a huge role as inspiration for my lyrics.&rdquo;
