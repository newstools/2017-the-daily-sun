Then I saw the fire jumping to her skirt and other school clothes.” Luckily, they managed to put out the fire.On Friday, vutha again allegedly attacked the girl and pastors were called in to pray for the girl.Resident Violet Ramadiehe (34) said she heard people screaming in her neighbour’s yard and ran to investigate. “I saw the girl running with flames coming from her skirt. We came out with a hosepipe and buckets of water to put out the fire. It was the most terrible thing I have ever seen,” said Violet.The mum said this has never happened in her family. “I’m scared to sleep in the house.” Community leader Rendani Mandiwana (42) said she had organised pastors to pray for the teen. “Pastors saw the fire and the girl climbing onto the roof of the shack. They prayed and persuaded her to come down. We put out the fire completely.” She said after the prayers, the girl was calm.“We don’t know what will happen if the fire starts at night when she is asleep.”When Daily Sun visited the family, they had removed the furniture and blankets that caught fire when the girl’s shoes were placed on it.
