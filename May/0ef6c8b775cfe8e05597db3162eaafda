FOREIGN-OWNED shops were the target of angry residents who accused foreigners of kidnapping children.Shops were looted and burnt in parts of KwaMashu, north of Durban, after rumours were spread that children were being kidnapped from schools.The announcement was allegedly made from a car fitted with a megaphone. The car drove around KwaMashu on Monday as the announcer allegedly told parents to fetch their kids because children had been kidnapped from the local school.During the rampage which took place from Monday night until Tuesday morning, the residents blockaded roads with burning tyres. An ATM was bombed and five shops near KwaMashu Hostel were looted and destroyed.Tamiiat Bodoat (27), a shop owner in KwaMancinza, said he was woken on Monday night by his landlord, who told him to run for his life.&ldquo;He said residents were coming for my blood. My brother and I spent the night in hiding. When we came to the shop yesterday, everything was destroyed.&rdquo; Tamiiat said he was worried by the false accusations made against foreigners.&ldquo;But we will continue with our business once the situation has calmed down.&rdquo; Mzwamandla Cele (47), Tamiiat&rsquo;s landlord, said he begged residents not to burn the shop because his house would also be burnt. &ldquo;No one has reported their children missing,&rdquo; he said.Most of the looted shops in the township and surrounding areas were closed yesterday. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said the violence was caused by fake reports of children being abducted.He said: &ldquo;Those responsible for co-ordinating the violence, looting and damaging property, will be brought to book.&rdquo;
