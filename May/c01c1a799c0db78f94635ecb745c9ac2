ON THURSDAY South Africa celebrated 23 years of democracy. The birth of democracy was supposed to bring freedom from discrimination for all.Sadly, people with albinism are still suffering.They continue to experience abuse and their human rights violated because of the harmful attitudes and beliefs associated with albinism.As recently as three weeks ago, Daily Sun reported on the murder of Lorraine Makgwahlela (18).When her body showed signs of being mutilated, all hell broke loose. Three houses, including that of a sangoma, were burned down. Some refer to people with albinism as cursed while others associate them with good luck.Either way, they are often treated differently because of these labels.From being insulted to having to deal with prejudice, people with albinism say there are still many issues to be addressed.Children are still being marginalised at schools.This is mostly attributed to the ignorance of pupils and teachers.In many communities they are still called inkawu, which means monkey, or leswafi, which means monster.A further drawback is that Mzansi does not have enough doctors who specialise in dealing with albinism, which means there often isn&rsquo;t adequate medical care when it is needed.Finding a job as a youngster is almost impossible, and chances of being promoted are slim because many view people with albinism as incompetent.BIGGER PROBLEM Government also admits the stigma is a problem.At a conference on Albinism last year, Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Lulu Xingwana said matters that had to be addressed include the reduction in medical and health costs for people with albinism. She said the cost of sunscreen and spectacles was escalating on a daily basis.The minister called medical professionals to create partnerships that will assist people with albinism. She added that there was a need for South Africans to do some soul-searching regarding the myths and harmful cultural practices that undermine the dignity of people with albinism.SOCIETY OF SUPPORT But while people with albinism are often victimised and even attacked, they still keep their heads high. Despite the odds, they still fight for their rights, because they are no different from other people.In this regard, the Albinism Society of South Africa is there to support them.The society was established in 1992, and is the brainchild of executive director Nomasonto Mazibuko. The whole idea behind establishing the organisation was to enhance people&rsquo;s self-esteem, enable and support parents to care properly for children with albinism and to create socially acceptable conditions for people with albinism. This is achieved by running a number of projects and programmes, as well as hosting workshops and seminars.
