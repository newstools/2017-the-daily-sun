THE family said goodbye to their gogo when she left with a relative for a traditional ceremony on Sunday . . . Later that same night the relative came rushing back, saying the gogo had fallen and was unable to get up!The family ran to her aid, but instead found her covered in blood and severely bruised.The fragile 87-year-old woman was rushed to hospital, where she died on Tuesday.Now the family from Nquthu, northern KZN, said they suspect jealous relatives were behind the gogo&rsquo;s death.A family member (42) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We were shocked to find her covered in blood because we had been told she just fell. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t even speak and had several bruises on her head. The relative couldn&rsquo;t answer us when we asked about the gogo&rsquo;s injuries.&ldquo;We suspect the relative is behind this. We&rsquo;ve heard from our neighbours that when the relative and the gogo left the ceremony, they didn&rsquo;t take the usual route home.&ldquo;Some of our relatives have always been jealous of our gogo because she had money. &ldquo;They blamed her for their lack of jobs and accused her of using muthi on them so that they wouldn&rsquo;t succeed in life. &ldquo;They said she wanted to be the only member of the family who had money.&rdquo;He said the gogo didn&rsquo;t have children and had saved her money while working in factories in Durban. &ldquo;We will make sure that those who are behind her death don&rsquo;t get a cent of her money,&rdquo; he said. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated by Nquthu police.
