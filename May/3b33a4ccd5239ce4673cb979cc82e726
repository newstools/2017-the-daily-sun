MUSA Mkhize says his uncle&rsquo;s affair with a younger woman has left him with an empty house. The 33-year-old from Germiston, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he regretted the day he helped his father&rsquo;s brother, because his lover stole everything she could from his home last week. &ldquo;My uncle was not feeling well, so my family asked if I could look after him. I did not mind and invited him to stay a few weeks ago, but it proved to be a big mistake,&rdquo; he said.As the weeks went past, Musa&rsquo;s uncle, Patrick Mkhize (58), started feeling better.He met a younger woman and fell head over heels in love. Patrick told the SunTeam: &ldquo;This woman has betrayed me. Last week, I went out while she was visiting and when I came back the house was empty. &ldquo;This evil woman and her friends stripped my nephew&rsquo;s house.&ldquo;They took his belongings including his plasma TV, a sound system and silver cutlery. &ldquo;He worked hard for those things. I feel it is all my fault because I brought her here.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa confirmed that a case of theft is being investigated and they are looking for the suspects.
