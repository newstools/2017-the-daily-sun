ORLANDO PIRATES go into today&rsquo;s Nedbank Cup semifinal match against Golden Arrows with their back against the wall.&nbsp; Set to play at the Princes Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu&sbquo; Durban, Bucs&rsquo; form this season has been poor. This was evidenced by the side&rsquo;s failure to qualify for next season&rsquo;s MTN8 competition.&nbsp; In fact, Pirates are left with only the Nedbank Cup to save their disastrous season.&nbsp; And new head coach Kjell Jonevret is a worried man. His side has racked up a whopping 15 draws in 29 Absa Premiership matches.&nbsp; Said Jonevret: &ldquo;That (15 draws) must be some sort of record. I&rsquo;ve never heard of a club drawing so many games.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Swede said Bucs badly needed goals. This, as the side had not scored in its last four league matches.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the side played to another 0-0 league draw against Ajax Cape Town at Orlando Stadium midweek, which dashed their top eight hopes.&nbsp; Bucs need an overhaul for the next season. But Jonevret was not sure how the system at Pirates worked regarding the recruit of new blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure how things work here. We&rsquo;ll sit down in the off-season and go through what went wrong. We need to improve our offensive, but I&rsquo;m not saying we need to go out and buy a striker.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jonevret, who came in February to save Bucs after Muhsin Ertugral and caretaker coach Augusto Palacios jumped ship, admitted he was ready to get to the cup final on penalties if his strikers fired blanks against Arrows today. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we reach the final and make our fans happy. We create chances, but we don&rsquo;t score,&rdquo; Jonevret said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Defensively, I&rsquo;ve been happy. But it&rsquo;s on the offence that we fail. We should be more clinical in our finishing. But if we have to go the penalty route to get to the final, then I&rsquo;ll take it that we are not an easy side to beat.&rdquo;But the return to the starting line-up of striker Dove Wome and midfielders Riyaad Norodien and Mpho Makola will boost his attacking options.&nbsp;The two sides will meet again in the final league match of the season at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium next Saturday.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope to make three trips to Durban before the seasons ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cup final will be played at the Moses Mabhida Stadium on 24 June.
