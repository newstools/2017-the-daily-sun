FIRST Thabang Tsakoa&rsquo;s wife came to South Africa and refused to go back home to Lesotho. Then on Sunday, while he was trying to get help, Mzansi took another precious thing from him when his car was stolen! The 36-year-old told Daily Sun his silver Toyota Noah with Lesotho registration number was taken while parked in Dobsonville, Soweto. He parked it to go to the police station to ask cops to escort him to his wife&rsquo;s workplace at a tavern. She had refused to let him in. Thabang said he and his two cousins were in the cop shop for no more than 10 minutes, but the car was gone when they came out. They were forced to sleep at the police station for three days as their passports, licences, cash and clothes were in the car. Now the heartbroken husband regrets ever going after his wife. He said when he went to the tavern his wife came out with four men and he was told to leave. &ldquo;I called her, but she did not want to come home. She knew we were going to the police to ask the cops to accompany us to her workplace,&rdquo; he said. Thabang said he suspected his wife had another man in her life and that was why she didn&rsquo;t want him any more.Thabang&rsquo;s wife, Nthabiseng, said she was working and could not go home.She refused to say whether she had a new man. Constable Mzwakhe Xazi said a case was opened but details could not be circulated because the car was not registered in South Africa. He said the theft was being investigated.
