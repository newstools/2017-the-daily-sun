SIFISO Mbanjwa was taken to the police station on Sunday two weeks ago for stealing an old TV &ndash; and that was the last time his family saw him alive.Cops at the Tsakane, Ekurhuleni police station told the family the next day that 33-year-old Sifiso had hanged himself with a belt in the police cells.&nbsp; But family spokeswoman Gloria Mathike (67), said: &ldquo;Sifiso does not own a belt and when he was arrested he didn&rsquo;t have one on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gloria told Daily Sun she thought her dead sister&rsquo;s son would be safe when he was taken away from angry residents by the police. She said Sifiso&rsquo;s brother, Linda Mathike (33), went to court on Monday but he didn&rsquo;t find Sifiso&rsquo;s name on the court roll. &ldquo;He then went to the police station where he was told Sifiso had hanged himself,&rdquo; said Gloria.&nbsp; Family member Girly Mbanjwa (44) said they were given three different times when Sifiso had supposedly killed himself. Girly said one cop told them that he didn&rsquo;t know how Sifiso got into the cells because there was no record of him being there.&nbsp; Spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Moses Dlamini, confirmed that a case has been opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;At this stage there are no findings about what caused Sifiso&rsquo;s death. The matter is still under investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
