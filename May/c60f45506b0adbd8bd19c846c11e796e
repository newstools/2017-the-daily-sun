MAMIKI Letlala (41) said she couldn&rsquo;t understand why she stayed in an abusive relationship.That was until she discovered muthi under her bed on Sunday.&ldquo;I could not say no to him.&ldquo;Instead I loved him more because he used the muthi to control me. When he realised that I was on to him, he tried to burn my shack down.&rdquo;Mamiki from Khayelitsha, Mangaung in the Free State, found muthi under the bed in her shack.She has a protection order against her boyfriend, whom she claims is abusive.&ldquo;We met in June and we decided to live together after two weeks. He gets piece jobs sometimes but I was the one supporting him.&rdquo;Mamiki said last week she came home from work and noticed her handbag was gone. He allegedly told her he had family visiting and they may have taken it. Mamiki said she was shocked when she looked under the bed and found the muthi. &ldquo;When I confronted him he became angry and told me it was to help him find work. He said he got it from a local prophet. I told him to leave and never come back.&rdquo; Mamiki claimed a witness saw him carrying a 5 litre container full of petrol.&ldquo;He got scared when he realised that he had been seen. I took out a protection order against him.&rdquo;Vusi Xwazi admitted the muthi was his but said it wasn&rsquo;t to trap Mamiki. He strongly denied the abuse allegations.&ldquo;I work as a taxi driver and I went to a sangoma because I keep having accidents but I didn&rsquo;t tell Mamiki about the muthi. I was in Welkom on Sunday. I would never burn her shack,&rdquo; said Vusi.
