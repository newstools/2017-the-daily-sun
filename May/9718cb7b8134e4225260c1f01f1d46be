FAKI Mosweu&rsquo;s parents never thought his death would spark violence and racial tension in the tiny North West town of Coligny.Protests rocking the town last week saw the total destruction of three properties. Yesterday, Daily Sun met with the parents of the grade 6 pupil, Faki (12). Saki Dingake (45) and Agnes Mosweu (43) from Scotland squatter camp said they were informed of his death on Sunday. &ldquo;Faki left on Thursday to buy paraffin. He brought it back and left.&rdquo; They never suspected the dead boy was their son. He will be buried on Saturday.Meanwhile, the men charged with Faki&rsquo;s murder, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, appeared in court on Friday.The case was postponed to 9 May.A police van carrying the men had to escape through another gate as residents waited at the main gate. People then held a meeting at a local hall. On their way some helped themselves to booze at a bottle store and blocked the road to the kasi. Cops first said Faki had fallen from the back of the farmer&rsquo;s bakkie, but a witness came forward to say he was attacked. The witness is being kept in a secret place for his safety, said police spokesman Sabata Mokgwabone. Magistrate Mattheus van Loggerenberg recused himself from the case, saying he was worried for his family&rsquo;s safety. Van Loggerenberg said the state attorney indicated that the post-mortem would be available at the next court date. The suspects did not plead. Residents agreed to stop their service delivery protest to give the task team a chance to resolve their issues. The team and community leaders addressed people at Blydeville Sports Ground yesterday. MEC Wendy Nelson noted their demands and said some will be met soon, while others will take longer. The team will meet with community leaders and officials daily and could possibly report back to residents by 12 May.
