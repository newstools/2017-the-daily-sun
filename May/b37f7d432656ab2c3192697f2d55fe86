You are the only person who can truly visualize your goals and journey. If you let other peoples opinion hold more weight than your own then you have lost the game of life already. Be fearless in the face of judgement. Be the person you are because of you. Trust yourself... As long as you see it and really believe the vision, EVERYTHING will come to life for you." ??: @yeahlenzo ------------------------------------------------------------ DOWNLOAD "KLY ft Riky Rick - Too Much" NOW.
