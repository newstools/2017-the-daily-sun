FIRST they had to suffer the indignity of using buckets when nature calls.Then, to add insult to injury, the municipal truck meant to collect the stinking buckets was late. Usually it is there at 4.30am, to the relief of residents. However, on Tuesday the truck only pitched up in Missionvale kasi at 2pm.Furious parents pelted the Nelson Mandela Bay municipal workers with insults when they finally arrived. About 12 schoolkids were seen coming to the workers&rsquo; aid to save them from more insults as they too rolled up their sleeves. Noni Mahlungulu (54) of Missionvale told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Ever since the municipality built us new RDP houses they always come late. By 2pm the sun was hot and the whole area was filled with smelly air. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t open doors or windows and couldn&rsquo;t cook the whole day. The municipality must take us seriously and give us flushing toilets.&rdquo;Annesty Adams (34) said: &ldquo;Boyfriends from other areas don&rsquo;t like us because of these buckets. &ldquo;Our relatives also don&rsquo;t visit regularly because they hate the bucket system. We need improved service delivery. &ldquo;Danny Jordaan promised before the election that we would soon have flushing toilets. The current mayor, Athol Trollip, also came and promised us that our RDPs would receive flushing toilets.&rdquo; Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;When there is a delay we always inform the councillor. The metro does have a set deadline for the bucket system.&rdquo;
