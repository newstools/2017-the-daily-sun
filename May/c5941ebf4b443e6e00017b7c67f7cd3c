AWARD-WINNING gospel artist Hlengiwe Mhlaba has been mocked for her dress sense.&nbsp; This after nasty comments were made live on air on Thursday morning, after Vuma FM breakfast show co-host, Zandile Dladla, allegedly started a discussion around Hlengiwe&rsquo;s dress sense.&nbsp; On the #GoodToGo! Breakfast show, airing weekdays from 6am to 9am, Zandile, popularly known as &ldquo;DJ Zeal&rdquo;, said the singer needed a makeover.&nbsp; Listeners began debating on the topic, which was about how to dress and look smart, but some comments seemed to have offended a few of Hlengiwe&rsquo;s fans.&nbsp; One fan, Eryck Dee, posted on Facebook: Eish! Sidinga isiguqo eMzansi, konakalephi ezweni lethu? Abahlukane noHlengiwe phansi. Umuntu abheke izindaba zakhe. (We really need a prayer in Mzansi. What&rsquo;s wrong with our country? People must leave Hlengiwe alone).&nbsp; One of the listeners named Nongcebo Ntshangase posted: Ayi akakhe amnike imakeover uHlengiwe uhlulwa ukugqoka. Sikhathele phela wuye namashirt akhe omgxobanyawo. (She must just give Hlengiwe that makeover. We&rsquo;re sick and tired of Hlengiwe dressing horrible in those traditional attire shirts).&nbsp; Listener Pinky MaHlongwa Ngcungama wrote: Ukuthi uyisdudla akusho ukuthi akalenge nje. Worse, she&rsquo;s in the entertainment industry, she must pay more attention to her image. Mina ngivumelana naye. (The fact that she&rsquo;s fat doesn&rsquo;t mean she must dress trashy. Worse she&rsquo;s in the entertainment industry, she must pay more attention to her image. I agree with Zandile).&nbsp; Hlengiwe refused to comment on the matter. &ldquo;I have no comment,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Vuma FM Public Relations Officer, Tony Mallam, said he was unaware of the debate. He asked to be sent an email, but failed to respond.&nbsp; Zandile refused to comment and hung up the phone.
