IN WHAT could be viewed as a moment of madness, desperation or even frustration, Chippa United boss, Siviwe &ldquo;Chippa&rdquo; Mpengesi, has allegedly ordered Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela to return to work today.&nbsp;Malesela was put on &ldquo;special leave&rdquo; weeks ago accused of poor results that saw the club rubbing shoulders with teams battling relegation.Things went from bad to worse for Chippa on Friday wen the Chilli Boys lost 1-0 to fellow strugglers Highlands Park, which saw them drop to 15th on the log with 24 points.Mbuyiselo Sambu also failed to turn the club&rsquo;s fortunes around since appointed caretaker coach as this was his third successive defeat.Collins Mbesuma took Highlands slightly out of the relegation zone by converting an all important penalty, which saw them move to 14th place with 25 points.Chippa are tied on 24 points with bottom side Baroka FC with goal difference separating the two sides.SunSport has reliably learnt that Mpengesi sent Malesela a letter on Friday afternoon, asking him to come back to work today.According to our source, Malesela agreed to return to Chippa.&nbsp;Chippa have always been on a downward spiral and they could find themselves campaigning in the National First Division next season or even negotiate their way back to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) via the promotion/relegation play-offs.Our source at the club revealed that Mpengesi realised his blunders by putting Malesela on the senseless &ldquo;special leave&rdquo;.&ldquo;Now chickens have come home to roost, as their hope of retaining their PSL is hanging by a thread,&rdquo; said the club official.&ldquo;Players and the majority of the club&rsquo;s employees were totally against the idea of sacking Dan.&ldquo;These are desperate times for Chippa and the players passionately asked the chairman to recall Dan who can make them play.&ldquo;But remember, technically Dan is still an employee of Chippa United. Being put on leave doesn&rsquo;t mean he was fired. Dan made a careful decision, considering he has seen the club&rsquo;s trust in him,&rdquo; the source added.Malesela is a big fan of the club and that is why he decided to go back to work to try and collect the remaining six points.On Wednesday&rsquo;n Chippa face the ambitious SuperSport United and complete the season with another relegation battle against Free State Stars on Saturday.
