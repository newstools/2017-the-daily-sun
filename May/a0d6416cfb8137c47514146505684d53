AN Abaqulusi local municipal council meeting had to be cancelled after IFP supporters disrupted it by throwing sour milk, oranges and eggs at councillors. The IFP-governed municipality is north of Durban in KZN."What transpired, a special council meeting couldn't finish because of the disruption, because IFP supporters disrupted it," municipal spokesman Arnold Ramodibe told News24.The meeting was scheduled to swear in Mncedisi Maphisa as the municipality's new mayor after the previous mayor Martin Mtshali issued his resignation. IFP supporters are believed to have protested Maphisa's appointment as mayor. "Roughly 90 supporters threw mostly eggs and oranges. Police later intervened when pepper spray was used," Ramodibe said. Ramodibe said he was not aware that teargas was used to disperse supporters. Council member and KZN DA leader Zwakele Mncwango said: "The pepper spray really made people really sick; people threw up. There were eggs and oranges everywhere." Mncwango believes the IFP will find solutions to the issue soon. "Previously you found intra-parties tension where political parties fought against each other. Now, increasingly we are finding parties fighting amongst themselves," he said. "Ultimately the community suffers the most when political parties fight."IFP KZN community organiser Mfanje Mbango said he was unable to provide comment on the incident at the moment. "We are in a meeting and discussing the incident, I cannot provide comment at the moment," he said. KZN police were unable to confirm the incident. &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eggs-oranges-fly-between-ifp-supporters-at-abaqulusi-municipal-meeting-20170512
