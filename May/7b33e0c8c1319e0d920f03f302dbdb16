take over their jobs.The survey also revealed that 78% of South Africans believe
the economic system favours the wealthy.South Africans (71%) want government to implement new rules
for multinational companies to “end abuse” of workers through supply chains. “Too many governments have compromised people’s prosperity
in the face of corporate greed with low wages and insecure work,” said ITUC
general secretary Sharan Burrow. According to Burrow, rules of the global economy have been
distorted to put the interests of the richest 1% and corporations ahead of
working people, and this power imbalance is driving mistrust in governments.The BRICS countries demand most action from their
governments, the report says, the concerns are linked to wage increases,
regulation of the digital economy to protect workers’ interests and protecting
secure employment rights for domestic and migrant workers.http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Labour/almost-all-working-south-africans-fear-losing-their-jobs-survey-20170516
