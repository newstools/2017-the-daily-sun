A DISPUTE over a family home almost cost a 36-year-old woman her life. The woman from Diepsloot, north of Joburg, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said her 26-year-old brother has been trying to get her out of their late mum&rsquo;s house since her mum died in 2002.She said last Thursday, he attacked her with a pickaxe handle. She was left with gashes on her head, a broken left arm and fractured ribs.&ldquo;He wanted to kick me out of the house so he could live there with his girlfriend.&rdquo; She said her brother fled after the attack but vowed to return. She and her two nieces were so scared that they have been sleeping at a friend&rsquo;s house. Marike Keller from Sonke Gender Justice advised the woman to get a protection order. &ldquo;I would also advise her to seek legal advice about the inheritance of the house.&rdquo; Constable Moyahabo Morata confirmed that a case of assault was opened at the Diepsloot cop shop. She said the suspect has not been arrested as they are still trying to find him.
