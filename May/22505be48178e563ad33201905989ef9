PATIENTS at one of Mthatha&rsquo;s busiest clinics will at least be able to sit down while waiting to be seen.On Friday the Ibandla Lasemthini Evangelist Movement donated 170 chairs to Gateway Clinic.This comes after the church&rsquo;s bishop, Tshepo Machaea, visited the clinic. He noticed that patients coming from various Mthatha townships had to stand in long queues before getting medical care at the clinic, which sees over 400 people a day.The clinic has only 10 nurses and they say serving scores of people is a job that weighs heavily on their shoulders. Nurse Lucia Blaai said every day they have people asking for chairs, especially for elderly people.Senior pastor at the church, Khanyisa Mtshazi, said: &ldquo;We decided to practise what we preach in church &ndash; that is, doing good in our community. We have to give the little we have to people in need.&rdquo;OR Tambo mayor Nomakhosazana Meth said more still needed to be done to help the clinic.Dr Singilizwe Moko from the office of the health MEC praised the church for being activists in society, and said the department of health will follow suit.
