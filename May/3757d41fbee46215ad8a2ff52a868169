THE people of this kasi are fed up!This was after a municipal truck broke down while collecting kak buckets in Clocolan, near Ficksburg, last Friday.Now the people are complaining about the smell of kak in their area. Resident Mary Molotsi (66) said: &ldquo;I was asleep when I suddenly smelt kak coming from outside. &ldquo;When I went to investigate, I was greeted by a broken truck in front of my yard, with kak splashed all over my gate. &ldquo;I had to close my doors and windows for hours until the truck was removed.&rdquo;Another resident, Joy Konto (48), said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time that residents have been affected by the bad smell of kak&ldquo;Last month, the very same truck spilled kak as it was moving around the kasi streets. This is not fair because our kids play barefoot in the streets and they sometimes get skin rashes.&rdquo; Moroesi Gaba, spokeswoman for Setsoto Municipality, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The municipality is aware that the truck was collecting sewage buckets at Thethe section when it broke down. &ldquo;Municipal workers attended to the matter immediately. &ldquo;As far as the claims of spilled sewage are concerned, the truck didn&rsquo;t spill any sewage and the residents didn&rsquo;t report any such incident.&rdquo;
