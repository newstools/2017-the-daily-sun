SEWAGE caused a lot of chaos when it flooded shacks in Masakhane, near KwaZakhele kasi, Port Elizabeth on Friday.The SunTeam arrived on Saturday morning as residents were trying to clean their homes.Others were hanging their wet clothes in the sun and cleaning their furniture.Resident Lindile Siyelana (64) said: &ldquo;The main drain in our area got blocked at about 5pm on Friday. It was the second time in two weeks.&ldquo;Last time the blocked drain was opened by plumbers, but on Friday we had the same problem again. By 8pm the kak water was pushing against our doors. Our councillor called many times but the municipal workers did not come.&ldquo;By 11pm the kak was inside our shacks. We battled the whole night and couldn&rsquo;t sleep. The whole area was stinking.&rdquo;A 35-year-old man said: &ldquo;I was called by my girlfriend and I found my room in a mess. We tried the whole night to get the sewage out of my shack but it kept on coming. Since the municipality installed new pipes in our area, the sewage is troubling us.&rdquo;Councillor Kholekile Boqwana slammed municipal plumbers who are on standby and said: &ldquo;I called them five times and said the people are suffering. Each time I called them they would promise to come soon. The infrastructure and engineering department failed us by not doing research before installing these pipes.&ldquo;The new pipes are too small to absorb the pressure. What will happen if the area is flooded by rain? People will swim in the water and kak.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani said: &ldquo;Our aim is to provide service 24 hours a day. I strongly urge the councillors to put pressure on the municipality to do its job.&rdquo;
