PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has been ordered to make public his reasons for reshuffling his cabinet in March. Judge Bashir Vally of the North Gauteng High Court yesterday ruled that Zuma must hand over records explaining why the decision was made. The reshuffle which saw Pravin Gordhan being axed sparked protests, a public outcry and a credit downgrade. The DA took the matter to court, arguing that the decision was subject to legal review. The DA earlier wanted the court to set aside Zuma&rsquo;s decision to dismiss Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, but the party&rsquo;s Advocate Steven Budlender was unable to do so, as Zuma refused to file the record and reasons for his decision. Budlender told the court in Tshwane yesterday that the records were essential as they would show whether Zuma&rsquo;s reshuffle was rational.He said it would also show whether Zuma claimed he was relying on an intelligence report, information which was publicly criticised by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. Pierre de Vos, a constitutional law expert, took to Twitter to explain aspects of the case. He explained that the only legal objection to Zuma&rsquo;s decision could be that he had given conflicting reasons for the reshuffle. &ldquo;But as this is a political decision, and there are no objective criteria for hiring or firing ministers, it will be very difficult to convince a court the decision was irrational,&rdquo; said De Vos. &ldquo;Every exercise of public power must be subject to the principles of legality and rationality, especially the exercise of all of the president&rsquo;s powers, which includes decisions to appoint or dismiss ministers and deputy ministers.&ldquo;The president ought to have reasonably foreseen the dire consequences of this reshuffle, given what happened in 2015 when he fired then finance minister Nhlanhla Nene.&rdquo;
