VUSI watched in horror as the raging flames grew in intensity.He had been tied up with his own shoelaces and was forced to watch as the hijackers built a bonfire to set him alight.But then the ancestors heard his prayers and the shoelaces became undone. Vusi escaped the fire.Vusi Ndlovu (53) from Jackson&rsquo;s Drift squatter camp near Eikenhof, Midvaal, said he was loading sand in his Nissan Hardbody bakkie last Monday when two thugs pounced on him.&ldquo;They pointed a gun at me and demanded the car keys. They told me they wanted to search the bakkie but they couldn&rsquo;t tell me why.&rdquo;Vusi was tied up and the fire was started before the men drove away in his bakkie. &ldquo;I thank the ancestors for saving my life.&rdquo;Residents of Jackson&rsquo;s Drift said the dense bush around their area is a problem. &ldquo;People are raped, robbed and hijacked here,&rdquo; said a resident.Community leader Nelly Goba said three cars have been hijacked in the bush.&ldquo;The hijackers wait in the bush for motorists who live in the squatter camp. It is not easy to see them coming because the bush is dense. &ldquo;We want the government to cut down the trees. We are not safe anymore,&rdquo; she said.A case of hijacking was opened at Mondeor Police Station.
