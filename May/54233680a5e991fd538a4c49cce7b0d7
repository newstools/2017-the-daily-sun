STELLENBOSCH University has distanced itself from neo-Nazi styled posters on the university&rsquo;s main campus.The posters have the words &ldquo;The Anglo-Afrikaner student&rdquo; written on them and call for students to &ldquo;fight for Stellenbosch&rdquo; by attending a meeting at the university&rsquo;s library on Thursday at 5pm.They appear to be photoshopped versions of posters used by Nazi&rsquo;s during their brutal reign in Germany.On the posters, the organisation called itself &ldquo;the new right&rdquo;.University spokesman Martin Viljoen told News24 that the university will not allow an event promoting racial superiority to take place on campus.&ldquo;[We] condemn racism, racial superiority and any attempts to polarise our campus community in the strongest possible terms,&rdquo; Viljoen said.He said the posters were placed on the university&rsquo;s campus without the university&rsquo;s knowledge.Reports surfaced on social media that the university&rsquo;s JS Gericke library approved the meeting, but Viljoen said the library only received a &ldquo;query&rdquo; about the meeting and no official booking was made.&ldquo;At this stage the origin of the posters are still unknown, but the university is currently following up on information received about the organisers,&rdquo; he said.On social media, South Africans and students criticised the university for the posters.Electronic music duo the Kiffness said: &ldquo; When you're photoshopping skills are on fleek but you're also a Nazi at Stellenbosch University.&rdquo;Student Khadija Omar Bawa said: &ldquo;This university already breeds Afrikaaner-dom, white supremacy and racial segregation.&rdquo;&ldquo;White Afrikaans "allies" hold your own accountable. Time to shine,&rdquo; she added.Just another normal day at stellenbosch university.... pic.twitter.com/3C4p2A6DMR&mdash; TeeKay Khumalo (@Royal_Khumalo) May 9, 2017http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/stellenbosch-university-condemns-far-right-poster-20170509
