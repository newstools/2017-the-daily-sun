WORLD Hypertension Day may have happened last week, but its message needs to be heard for a lifetime.Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition in Mzansi that often goes undetected. If undiagnosed, it could seriously damage your blood vessels and heart which causes heart failure, strokes, kidney disease, even vision loss.But why should we die from something that, if detected earlier, could easily be managed?Life Healthcare, one of Mzansi&rsquo;s leading hospital groups, encourages you to get tested. They want you to know your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose levels to prevent and control high blood pressure.Dr Vinod Thomas, a cardiologist and cardiac electrophysiologist at Life Vincent Pallotti Hospital in Cape Town, said while there may not be any symptoms, people should still get regular medical checks.&ldquo;If you are not consistent in making sure that your blood pressure is under control, you put yourself at increased risk of life threatening conditions.&rdquo;Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to your blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. With 6,3 million people living with high blood pressure, Mzansi has one of the highest rates of hypertension in the world. Prevent hypertension - Eat a well-balanced, low-salt diet.- Limit your alcohol and quit smoking.- Enjoy regular physical activity. - Maintain a healthy weight.- Check your blood pressure every yearKnow your numbers - If your blood pressure is below 120/80 then you have a normal healthy blood pressure. The first number is systolic &ndash; blood pressure during a beat &ndash; and the second is diastolic &ndash; blood pressure between beats.- If your blood pressure is above 140/90, you have hypertension and need treatment to avoid heart disease or worse.
