But there are many ways an abuser can inflict pain that don&rsquo;t involve fists.Although women can also be abusers, most often men are the ones doing the abusing. Every abuser has as his aim one thing and one thing only: to dominate and control the person he&rsquo;s abusing.There are many emotional weapons an abuser can use to make a person feel powerless and useless. These include using fear, guilt and shame to wear down the abused person and keep her under his thumb.What can make things really confusing is that abusers often don&rsquo;t take responsibility for their actions. Instead, they blame the victim for their cruel behaviour.
