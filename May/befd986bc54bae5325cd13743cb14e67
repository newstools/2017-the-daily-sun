ANOTHER meeting of the Nelson Mandela Bay city council has ended in chaos. The meeting at the Wool Board Building in Port Elizabeth yesterday saw deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani and ANC Councillor Siphiwo Plaatjies kicked out by the council speaker, Jonathan Lawack.The disruption comes after an announcement that the UDM and DA had sorted out their disagreements.The DA had proposed the sale of land in Algoa Park situated near the library and which is being used by driving schools.Bobani rejected the proposal and EFF and ANC councillors agreed with him. Verbal clashes continued all morning and the item was discontinued on three occasions. Bobani and Plaatjies were ordered to leave the chamber, but the two shouted back and refused to go, saying the speaker was attempting to reduce voting numbers. Bobani wasted no time in addressing the media after being shown the door.&ldquo;We were not consulted about the land issue by our coalition partner and raised objections.&ldquo;It just so happened we spoke the same language as the ANC and EFF. &ldquo;Rule 37 allows me to speak. I told the speaker he was behaving like Baleka Mbete, abusing his powers.&rdquo;He said the UDM remained a partner in the coalition and the ANC was still the opposition, but declined to speak further on a decision to leave the issue in the hands of UDM president Bantu Holomisa and DA leader Mmusi Maimane.Bobani was sacked over misconduct last week as head of health by mayor Athol Trollip.Lawack told council that Bobani and Plaatjies were disruptive and disrespectful. &ldquo;The rules allow me to give them marching orders.&rdquo;Trollip&rsquo;s spokesman, Sibongile Dimbaza, said the mayor had deferred the sale of the land for further consultation.
