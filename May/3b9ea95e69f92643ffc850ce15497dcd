IT SEEMS tension between Lerato Kganyago and Dineo Ranaka is allegedly so thin, you can cut it with a butter knife. According to sources, the two have allegedly been at each other’s throats since being paired up for Metro FM’s The Bridge show, airing weekdays from 10am to noon. The first mole claimed the two were putting up with each other for the sake of the show. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Said the mole: “Tension is brewing. Many of us are scared something bad is on the horizon. In fact, they recently faced off following a sexual joke by Dineo during the show.” When asked to comment, Dineo dismissed the claims as nonsense. She said: “Seriously guys, stop it with this nonsense. Lerato and I get along very well. You’ve officially spoiled my weekend.” And Lerato also dismissed the allegations as “utter rubbish”. But according to a second source, Lerato thought the joke was in bad taste – and didn’t find it funny. “But Dineo told her where to get off, and things got ugly. It was so bad, they came close to being physical with each other,” the source claimed. “Dineo became the bigger woman about things. She left the studio to clear her head. When she came back, the show continued.” A third source claimed the show’s producers were always shooting down Dineo’s ideas. Claimed the source: “Because of this, Lerato feels like she’s the main driver of the show and Dineo is just a passenger. “But she forgets that Dineo has more radio experience and credibility. Phela, she’s a real broadcaster, not just a pretty face.” When asked to comment, SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, said: “We are unaware of any beef between Dineo and Lerato.”
