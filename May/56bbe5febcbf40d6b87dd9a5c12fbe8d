FOLLOWING the escape of five lions from the Kruger National Park, SANParks has urged the public not to fear the animals. People should call the authorities instead of confronting animals spotted outside the boundaries of the park. Danie Pienaar of SANParks said: &ldquo;When people try to chase lions away or run away from them, it becomes dangerous.&rdquo;Four of the lions were caught and the search for the fifth has been called off. Pienaar said the fifth lion could have walked back into the park. &ldquo;It may have been in communication with its pride. Animals leave their smell behind,&rdquo; he said. He said the park&rsquo;s fencing cannot be made stronger and 24-hour monitoring is not possible. &ldquo;Fences are broken by large animals. Trying to keep a lion in with a fence is difficult because they can get through a small hole. &ldquo;The danger that lions pose to the public depends on the situation, but predators don&rsquo;t hunt people.&ldquo;When they see people during the day they run away, but it&rsquo;s a different story at night. Lions are more aggressive then.&rdquo;
