IF YOU are on the run, it&rsquo;s a good idea just to keep running.But these two awaiting trial prisoners who escaped from police holding cells not only stopped running but tried to find jobs. When they failed to get work, the tired escapees took to bed. Cops launched a manhunt for three awaiting trial prisoners who escaped from the Machadodorp Police Station holding cells in Mpumalanga on Thursday afternoon.Police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The three men escaped while the police were conducting a routine cell visit. &ldquo;The three inmates allegedly attacked the cops. During the scuffle, a shot went off and hit one of the inmates who was wrestling with a police official over a firearm. He was found dead next to police station fence.&rdquo;The other two prisoners, Themba Nkosi (21) and Sibusiso Lusenga (25), who were facing charges of common robbery, kidnapping and assaulting an inmate, managed to escape. They fled with a cop&rsquo;s gun. &ldquo;On Saturday, cops received a tip-off about the pair&rsquo;s whereabouts. The cops cornered them at a farm 30km from Machadodorp. Both men were found fast asleep. We understand that they came to the farm searching for jobs. &ldquo;They were given food and a place to sleep. The firearm was found in their possession and they were arrested. The investigation continues,&rdquo; said Hlathi.
