GOLDEN Arrows forward Lerato Lamola has promised to pull off a surprise upset this weekend when they host Orlando Pirates in the Absa Premiership at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday (3pm).He says they cannot surrender to the same team twice in a row, as they also have the ambition and goal to finish the season in a good position.Bucs knocked Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende out of the Nedbank Cup thanks to a solitary goal by Abbubaker Mobara to qualify for the final. &ldquo;This time around we will make sure we take our chances,&rdquo; said the 30-year-old.&ldquo;Now we know what we need to do to win &ndash; and we will do it.&rdquo;Arrows need all three points against Pirates and Ajax need to lose or draw for the Durban outfit to get that top eight spot. The Urban Warriors currently occupy eighth spot with 36 points and Arrows are ninth with 35. Lamola added: &ldquo;In football there are no favours, so we don&rsquo;t expect Pirates to do us any. &ldquo;We expect a tough and competitive match.&rdquo;Any result apart from maximum points could see Arrows having a repeat of last season &ndash; missing out on a top eight finish in the last match of the campaign. They were level on points (40) with SuperSport United last season but lost out to them on goal difference. The same could happen again if they draw with Pirates and Ajax lose to Baroka. This would result in Arrows ending level on points with Ajax, but Ajax will be in the top eight on superior goal difference.
