AUTHORITIES have successfully recaptured four of the five lions believed to have escaped from the Kruger National Park today.SANparks spokesman Reynold Thakhuli said a second chopper was dispatched to reinforce the search operation and this has really helped in the capturing of these animals.Thakhuli could not confirm how close they were to recapturing the fifth big cat, saying it has become dark.Earlier, Thakhuli said the five adult males were cast out by a large pride of lions."This is not uncommon behaviour for these animals. They tend to fight for territory."He said the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Authority were leading the search operation with SAPS and SANparks.People in the area were advised to take care and not go out on foot.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/fourth-kruger-park-national-park-lion-recaptured-20170509
