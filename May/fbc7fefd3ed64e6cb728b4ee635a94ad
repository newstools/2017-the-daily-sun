FREE State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka is cracking the whip!Letsoaka has reconstructed his technical bench by demoting Themba Sithole and calling in David Vilakazi as Ea Lla Koto pull out all the stops in a bid to avoid relegation.SunSport has reliably learnt that Stars boss Rantsi Mokoena has agreed to the appointment of Vilakazi as assistant to Letsoaka and the Sithole demotion after they apparently had a falling out. Ea Lla Koto are in real danger of relegation, seeing that only one point separates them from bottom club Highlands Park. They are tied with second from bottom Baroka FC on 23 points with four games to play.Said the source: &ldquo;Sithole questioned Serame&rsquo;s selection policies and tactics, which affected the team&rsquo;s performance.&ldquo;But Serame was not prepared to take advice from his assistant and complained to management that Sithole was interfering with his job and disrespecting him. This led to Sithole&rsquo;s demotion, as management is more worried about avoiding relegation than petty squabbles.&rdquo;However, Mokoena said there was no bad blood between Letsoaka and Sithole.He went on: &ldquo;This was a straight swap, there are no issues. Sithole is happy to be in charge of our development structures. Vilakazi was with our youth and will now be the assistant. He has been associated with the team for a long time as a player and coach. His knowledge of the game will help the team and Letsoaka is happy to work with him.&rdquo; Sithole has helped Stars on an interim basis on many occasions whenever the management got rid of a coach due to poor results. But that relationship seems to have deteriorated. However, it remains to be seen whether Letsoaka and Vilakazi will be able to save Ea Lla Koto from the dreaded axe.
