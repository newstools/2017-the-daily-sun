SHE was bedridden for two years and was confined to a mattress . . . But gogo Flora Nene (85) from KwaMbewunye Village in Nquthu, northern KZN, has now been given a wheelchair and can move around!It was donated to the gogo by the ANC&rsquo;s KZN chairman, Sihle Zikalala, last week.This happened during the party&rsquo;s door-to-door campaign, ahead of the by-election that takes place next Wednesday.Zikalala visited the Nenes after the ward committee had told the ANC about gogo Flora&rsquo;s problem.Her son Mphumuzeni (50) said that, as Nquthu was in a deep rural area, they had not known where to seek help.&ldquo;The by-election is a blessing in disguise because, without it, my mother would still have been on the mattress,&rdquo; said Mphumuzeni.He said since 2015 the elderly Flora, had been unable to walk, hear or speak.&ldquo;I was forced to quit my job in Joburg and had to come back home to look after my mum.&rdquo; &ldquo;She was confined to the mattress, day and night. It was so sad. In her younger days she used to wake up early, before the sun came up, to prepare food and clean the house.&ldquo;But for the past two years she was unable to do that. She couldn&rsquo;t walk.&ldquo;Joy was written all over her face when she received the wheelchair, even though she can&rsquo;t speak or hear anything. Apparently, she even started playing with her wheelchair, almost as if it was a new toy.
