FIRST madala Sonosakhe Ntanzi (65) looked at the roof and said he saw lighting there and then he complained of pain. He collapsed and died on Tuesday. His wife, Paulina Koma (55), saw the same thing on the roof at about the same time her husband died.She also felt pain &ndash; and died on Wednesday night.And now the Ntanzi children fear they will be next!This was after a prophet revealed to their daughter, Salamina Koma (36), that jealous church members were allegedly behind the strange deaths of her parents.The incidents have left the community of extension 2, Nellmapius, in Tshwane in shock. Salamina told Daily Sun her parents were killed by the same thing and believes they died because they helped people for free. She said both her parents were bishops of the Apostolic Church and prayed for people without charging them. Salamina claimed that those who wanted to make the church a business bewitched her parents. &ldquo;My parents had enemies who wanted their positions at church and they died for those positions. I consulted a prophet who confirmed my suspicions.&rdquo; She said she was afraid their enemies might come for her and her brother because they were also both believers and would continue running the church. &ldquo;If I had my way, I would sell this house and go to an informal settlement, but I have to be strong for my four siblings.&rdquo; Salamina&rsquo;s brother, Thapelo Koma (32), said they would continue to run the church. &ldquo;If I die for the Lord then let it be. My parents&rsquo; deaths were not natural and it is clear this was the work of evil people. But I believe God will protect us,&rdquo; he said. A sangoma, Sibongile Maluleka, said the family should consult a healer so that the killers can be stopped.
