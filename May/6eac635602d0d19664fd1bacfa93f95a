DA police shadow minister, Zakhele Mbhele, wants Speaker Baleka Mbete to hold a debate on violence against women.This is in light of recent killings of women such as Lerato Moloi, Popi Qwabe, Bongeka Phungula and other women and children. &ldquo;The sad truth is that this is not new. Women in South Africa are routinely subjected to these horrific acts,&rdquo; said Mbhele.The DA wants Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, Women Minister Susan Shabangu and Justice Minister Michael Masutha to take part in the debate.According to the NPA, 19 children have been killed in the Western Cape since January. Spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said: &ldquo;The State and police can&rsquo;t deal with this on their own. It would help if we got help long before a stage of finger pointing.&rdquo; Organisation Ilitha Labantu urged South Africans to speak out. &ldquo;We need to break the silence which breeds men who abuse women,&rdquo; said spokesman Siya Mamkeli.Daily Sun asked readers what their opinions were.Nokhanyo Mathe (38) said: &ldquo;We fear what will happen to our kids. When they&rsquo;re not home we worry if they&rsquo;ll come back alive.&rdquo;Thando Ngobane (41) said: &ldquo;Children are killed by their own parents. Drugs are the problem.&rdquo;Zanele Xakata (46) said: &ldquo;Corruption is the problem. Drug lords work with cops and will kill us.&rdquo;
