IT IS a story Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is more than willing to share as proof that Wednesday&rsquo;s African Champions League tie against AS Vita Club will separate the boys from the men.He is happy to recount the developments since last year when Downs were eliminated from the biggest African club competition by the Black Dolphins of DR Congo on the away-goal rule after a 2-2 aggregate final scoreline.Fast forward to this Wednesday and Mosimane will again come face-to-face with his No 1 African coaching rival, Florent Ibenge.Mosimane said: &ldquo;It is all about having the best tactics,&rdquo; agreeing that their clash on the artificial turf of Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa (4.30pm) will be a grudge match.&ldquo;They actually went as far as making the ridiculous claim that we stole their trophy! They believe they would have won the trophy had they not been replaced by us after getting suspended by Africa&rsquo;s football controlling body.&ldquo;It was not our fault they used an ineligible player.&rdquo;He admitted Ibenge is a big achiever in Africa, which makes him his big rival, &ldquo;like Gavin Hunt is my big competitor in South Africa&rdquo;.But the Sundowns coach believes getting maximum points is crucial, saying they will go out on an all out attack.However, he will be forced to start with Thabo Nthethe as centre-back in the absence of injured defenders Ricardo Nascimento, Wayne Arendse, Soumahoro Bangaly and Motjeka Madisha.Some good news for Sundowns is the return to action of Sibusiso &ldquo;Villa&rdquo; Vilakazi, who could add some much-needed firepower and fresh legs up-front. &ldquo;Look, we know the Champions League, we know how to win it &ndash; and how it feels to win it,&rdquo; Mosimane added.&ldquo;The important thing for my players to do is buy into my philosophy and follow instructions, which they normally do. Fatigue could be our biggest challenge, as you have seen with the drop in form of Khama Billiat, Percy Tau, Denis Onyango, Anthony Laffor and Hlompho Kekana. But we will fight for our crown.&rdquo; Sundowns, as defending champions, will be under serious scrutiny and attack from their Group C opponents, which also include Esperance of Tunisia and Saint George of Ethiopia. Vita started the tournament on a losing note with a shock 3-1 loss to Esperance, which sees them at the bottom of the table.
