LINDA Gongotha said he can&rsquo;t sleep at night because of his worries about sharing his identity number. The 54-year-old from Protea Glen, Soweto, is one of the tens of thousands of South Africans with a duplicate ID number. Linda told Daily Sun he found out about the problem when he went to the bank to get a statement and was told his fingerprints didn&rsquo;t match those on the system. He was sent to Home Affairs, where he made the shocking discovery. &ldquo;I feel as if I&rsquo;m cursed. This is the second time I have had to apply for an ID. I can&rsquo;t sleep because I think about who this person is.&ldquo;Whoever they are, they have made my life a living hell.&rdquo; Linda, who has a wife and two daughters, said the matter was affecting him and his family. &ldquo;I spend all day at work thinking about this. I can&rsquo;t get the time off to fix it.&rdquo;Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola said the department was trying to sort out the issue of ID number duplicates. &ldquo;I advise Linda to approach his nearest Home Affairs office for assistance.&rdquo;
