BIDVEST Wits midfielder Phumlani Ntshangase says the battle lines are now drawn as the PSL reaches its final stretch and the Students, Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City bid for top honours.Only three matches remain before the 2016-17 season comes to a close and the three clubs all hope to bag the haul of nine points on offer.Ntshangase reckons concentration will be key if they are to win their first PSL trophy. The last three seasons have served as a lesson for the Clever Boys not to get ahead of themselves just to let it slip in the last days of the campaign.Wits currently have bragging rights at the summit of the Absa Premiership table with 57 points &ndash; three points more than second placed Sundowns. Hot on the heels of Sundowns are the Citizens in third place with 52 points &ndash; five points fewer than Wits.Ntshangase said they had been in this situation before: &ldquo;We know this race now. We&rsquo;re aware it&rsquo;s not going to be easy. &ldquo;I think focus, concentration, dedication and togetherness as a team will help us through.&rdquo;Wits have won their last three matches by just an odd goal, but are just happy to get much-needed maximum points. The Under-23 international admits it won&rsquo;t easy to return with three points from Serame Letsoaka&rsquo;s Free State Stars when they clash at Goble Park tomorrow (7.30pm).He said they were expecting a dry pitch which would make things difficult: &ldquo;We are fighting for the league &ndash; everyone wants to beat us and we want to beat everyone.&rdquo; Meanwhile, coach Gavin Hunt is hopeful that the Free Staters will deal them better cards this time. Ea Lla Koto aren&rsquo;t safe from the relegation axe and getting a victory over Wits will give them some relief.Said Hunt: &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s our time now. We are going to go there with a positive mind set. &ldquo;They are a hard side to play down there but we are fighting on the other end of the table.&rdquo;
