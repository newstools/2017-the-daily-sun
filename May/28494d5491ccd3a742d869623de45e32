LETTY Ngalanga (37) believes that her mum will never rest in peace until she fulfils her dying wish.Letty from Mamelodi, Tshwane said her late mother, Nomthandazo Ngalanga-Zondi, has been haunting her.&ldquo;She is demanding that I find my two cousins,&rdquo; she said.After burying her mum in March, Letty found a letter while cleaning.The letter, written in Zulu by Nomthandazo, said the two cousins, Thembi and Sibongile Khumalo, were missing and Letty must find them. The cousins are the daughters of Deliwe, who was Nomthandazo&rsquo;s sister.Letty said before her mum died she always spoke about finding the missing cousins but the family never did anything about it. She said since she found the letter her mother has been visiting her every night, saying &ldquo;ba nyake&rdquo; (find them), then she disappears.&ldquo;I have never met them or even seen their pictures,&rdquo; Letty said.Deliwe allegedly left her daughters with their father, only known as Khumalo.&ldquo;No one knows where Deliwe went but Khumalo took Thembi and Sibongile to Bapsfontein, near Bronkhorstspruit. &ldquo;I was not yet born then but now I need to find them to end this nightmare,&rdquo; Letty said.Her mum said she last saw the cousins at their father&rsquo;s funeral years ago.&ldquo;I need to see them so I can sleep at night again,&rdquo; Letty said.
