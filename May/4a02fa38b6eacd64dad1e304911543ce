JOBS are scarce in the Eastern Cape and residents will do anything to find work. Greedy people use this to rob people of their money in jobs-for-cash offers. Government departments are not spared in these scams. The Eastern Cape transport department has warned residents to be on the lookout for a man who scams desperate jobseekers.Khuselwa Rantjie, a spokesman for the department, said: &ldquo;The department received information regarding a man called &lsquo;Madiba&rsquo;, who allegedly goes around promising people posts as drivers at the department.&rdquo;The man, who allegedly operates in the Joe Gqabi area in Sterkspruit, asks for R500 be deposited at one of the big supermarkets.&ldquo;The department would like to distance itself from this criminal activity, as there have been no driver&rsquo;s posts advertised by the department. &ldquo;The public is also warned that government departments would never request payment to supply an application form. &ldquo;Anyone who comes in contact with this man should contact the cops or call our customer care centre on 0800 644 644.&rdquo;
