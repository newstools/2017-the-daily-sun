TODAY marks World No Tobacco Day, which encourages people to quit smoking. As almost a third of Mzansi&rsquo;s population smokes tobacco, the African Christian Democratic Party is marking the day to bring attention to the health problems that smoking causes. MP Cheryllyn Dudley told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Tobacco causes pollution and health problems. &ldquo;Preventable healthcare costs alone make efforts to encourage people to stop smoking worthwhile. In line with this thinking, the minister of finance increased tax on tobacco products by 8% in February. &ldquo;But a review of cigarette retail prices shows prices have not increased and on average, have become cheaper.&rdquo; Dudley said the party was joining calls for the Treasury to make cigarettes less affordable to reduce the harm done to society, especially to poor people. It&rsquo;s believed that 44 000 people die in South Africa every year from smoking related illnesses, including lung cancer and heart disease. Although research shows that the number of smokers has decreased in Mzansi, one in five people still smoke. According to statistics, 30% of men and 5,8% of youths smoke, most having their first cigarette at the age of 10.Tips to quit: Remove tobacco products from your home environment Ask people around you not to smoke Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise and drink water to avoid headaches, coughing, weight gain and tension while quitting Try medication or nicotine gum to fight cravings and tide you over for the first few weeks.
