INYANGA Lizwi Madida owes his life to the cops! The 54-year-old from KwaDlangezwa in Empangeni, northern KZN, believes that if the cops hadn&rsquo;t stopped the car he was in, he probably would be lying dead somewhere . . . &ldquo;I thank my ancestors for saving my life from Isikebhe members,&rdquo; he said. The Isikebhe forum fights stock theft in northern KZN. Madida was in town on Friday morning when he was allegedly approached by four armed men. &ldquo;They accused me of stealing goats in a certain area,&rdquo; said Madida. &ldquo;I told them I knew nothing about the goats, but they went ahead and locked me up in a house near the taxi rank.&ldquo;Later, they forced me into the back of a van and drove off with me.&rdquo;&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t tie my hands with any rope, nor did they cover my face. But their faces were serious enough to frighten me.&rdquo;The van was stopped by police . . . &ldquo;The police started searching the van and I screamed loudly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the cops found out I was kidnapped. They rescued me and arrested the four men.&rdquo;Madida said he was glad the men were caught because they had threatened to do something terrible to him on reaching their destination. &ldquo;They told me about another man they beat up so badly he became paralysed. &ldquo;They had accused him of stealing livestock, too.&rdquo;Madida, an inyanga, has helped and healed many people. Some grateful ones give him livestock. Isikebhe president Joseph Manyathi confirmed that the arrested men are members of the forum. He said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t harm livestock theft suspects, but we take them to residents &ndash; where they are asked about the theft. &ldquo;When they admit their wrongdoing, we get them to show us where the livestock is. &ldquo;We must highlight that through this initiative, we have been able to recover hundreds of stolen livestock.&rdquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;The four suspects will appear in the Esikhaleni Magistrates Court on Tuesday to face a kidnapping charge.&rdquo;
