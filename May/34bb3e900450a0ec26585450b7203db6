THE decision by the Umhlabuyalingana mayor to freeze all municipal projects has sparked outrage. Furious workers have claimed that mayor Nkululeko Mthethwa did not consult anyone. Yesterday, they downed tools and protested outside the offices of the northern KZN municipality. They won&rsquo;t go back to work until the mayor reverses his decision. The workers said Mthethwa sent them a letter on Wednesday, telling them to stop work on all municipal projects and service delivery. They told him they wouldn&rsquo;t. Worker Sibonelo Bhengu (31) said: &ldquo;After he gave us the letter, we asked why he made the decision, but he failed to give us a valid explanation. He just told us to follow his orders or leave.&rdquo; Another worker (34) said as municipal workers, their duty was to provide services to residents. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him do this to residents. We can&rsquo;t let people suffer because of one man. We are not going back to the office until the matter is resolved.&rdquo;Mthethwa said he froze projects because service delivery was not equal. &ldquo;I want to fix that. It should be distributed equally. I wrote the letter because I want what is good for residents.&ldquo;All workers on strike will face the consequences for not coming to work.&rdquo;
