HENDRICK Chandaga loves the minister of police, Fikile Mbalula . . . Hendrick (27) loves Mbaks so much that he&rsquo;s even prepared to give up his beloved creation, a home-made chopper that looks like a police helicopter! &ldquo;Minister, we&rsquo;ll fly high and fight crime together!&rdquo; said the man from Dilopye Village in Hammanskraal, Tshwane.He said the chopper was a symbol of his love for law enforcement. He had always wanted to become a cop, but it didn&rsquo;t work out that way.&ldquo;Even though I couldn&rsquo;t be one of the men in blue, my talent has helped me to have something that connects me to my dream,&rdquo; he said.But now he is ready to hand the chopper, which is made from scrap metal and even has a sound system, over to the police minister.Hendrick said he wanted Mbalula to have the helicopter to show his appreciation for the way the minister has changed the department in such a short time.&ldquo;Since he became minister, I have seen dedication and hard work from the cops. Mbalula showed that he truly wants to fight crime,&rdquo; he said. Hendrick took his gift to Mbalula when he was at Soshanguve cop shop on Friday, but the minister was busy. &ldquo;I still hope I&rsquo;ll get a chance to meet him and give it to him,&rdquo; said Hendrick.The minister&rsquo;s spokesman, Esethu Hasane, said the minister had been the helicopter on Friday but didn&rsquo;t have time to talk to Hendrick. Hasane said they would make plans to meet Hendrick when the minister is in Tshwane again.&ldquo;The minister is in Cape Town at the moment, but we will meet with Hendrick,&rdquo; he said.
