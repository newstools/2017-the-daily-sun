All nine of us in the house rely on the grants of the three grandchildren, which is at least R900 per month,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;As I speak, I don&rsquo;t have food and don&rsquo;t even know how any of us are going to survive, let alone this week.&rdquo;Zizi told the People&rsquo;s Paper she had even turned to gambling, sometimes playing Fafi (also known as mo-china) with R5 &ndash; in the hope of winning enough money to buy her family food.Zizi, who sometimes gets gigs at festivals in September and December, appealed to the government to help legendary musicians.Her plea also went to event organisers and the business fraternity to &ldquo;book the golden oldies&rdquo;, as their music was &ldquo;still relevant&rdquo;.Dropping her pearls of wisdom, the artist cautioned up-and-coming musicians to invest their money.&ldquo;The music industry is a beast that has more downs than ups,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Young people should make sure that they spend and invest their money wisely, so they don&rsquo;t end up as paupers.&rdquo;Zizi said the local music industry was riddled with &ldquo;many things&rdquo; that sought to &ldquo;tempt the uninitiated into making poor decisions&rdquo; that would lead them down a path to poverty.
