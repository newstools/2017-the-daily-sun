IN a new twist, President Jacob Zuma has demanded that the DA provide him with the so called Operation Checkmate report within five days. Zuma&rsquo;s lawyers wrote to the party on Tuesday asking for all the details of the report, including its author and the date it was produced. The DA has alleged that the president might have relied on the contents of the report to justify firing Pravin Gordhan as finance minister and Mcebisi Jonas as his deputy. The report apparently claimed Jonas and Gordhan were meeting with foreign businesses to discredit Zuma. The letter sent by Zuma&rsquo;s lawyers also said the full details of the document must be provided. This comes after last week&rsquo;s order by the North Gauteng High Court for Zuma to provide the record and reasons for his decision to fire Gordhan and Jonas. He is required to hand over the information by tomorrow.The DA previously applied to the court to set aside the firing of Gordhan and Jonas until Zuma gave his reasons for axing them on record and shared the information he relied on. Judge Bashir Vally said Zuma had remained silent on the issue of whether the report existed, which left him no option but to order the record of the decision to be handed over. &ldquo;There is not a soupcon of evidence concerning a record from the president. The president has elected to remain completely quiescent on this aspect,&rsquo; said Vally.
