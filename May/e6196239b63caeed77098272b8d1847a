EVEN though teaching started again on Thursday at Hlengiwe Secondary School in Illovo, south of Durban, parents still want the education department to intervene in challenges facing the school. They told Daily Sun the school was not operating for two weeks because it did not have enough resources. Parent Nokubonga Mavundla (36) said: &ldquo;The school has not had a principal since November last year, and that is why things are falling apart. &ldquo;The school does not have paper, chalk and other stationery. Teachers cannot do the job without the necessary resources. &ldquo;We had several meetings with the school&rsquo;s management and they said they do not know where the school&rsquo;s money is. &ldquo;The acting principal is having a hard time because she is clueless about many things.&ldquo;She is unable to answer our questions.&rdquo; Another parent, Bongumusa Mgobhozi (49), said they want the department to explain who is handling the school&rsquo;s budget. School governing body member Sthe Mchunu confirmed that the school was having some difficulties. &ldquo;The pupils protested two times this year.&ldquo;They are not happy about the quality of their education. We want the department to intervene immediately,&rdquo; she said. She added that ward Councillor Bhekumuzi Thabethe and parents had collected R4 000 for the school to buy some of the things it needed.Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they were not aware of the situation, but promised that MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana would attend to the complaints.&ldquo;The MEC said on Thursday he will make sure he hires teachers and principals to fill all the vacant posts at KZN schools. We believe this will normalise the situation at Hlengiwe Secondary too,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.
