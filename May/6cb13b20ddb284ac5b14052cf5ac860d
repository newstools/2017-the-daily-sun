WHEN blind couple Kgaugelo and Margaret Madua tied the knot in April, SunLanders toasted their love.WATCH: BLIND FAITH ENDS IN MARRIAGEBut the Madua couple from Mamelodi, Tshwane, does not have it easy these days. They are having difficulty trying to register their kids online for school.&nbsp;They told Daily Sun that officials at Mamelodi&rsquo;s Teacher Centre keep sending them from pillar to post.Kgaugelo and Margaret said they were losing hope that their children&rsquo;s school registration will be sorted out in time.Their two children were staying in Hammanskraal with Margaret&rsquo;s parents but now they want to live together. One of the kids is supposed to start grade&thinsp;1 next year, and the other is ready for grade&thinsp;8.&nbsp;&ldquo;We went to the Teachers&rsquo; Centre. The queues were so long and to add to our misery, people jumped us in the queue because we cannot see,&rdquo; said Kgaugelo.&nbsp;The couple left empty-handed and returned the following week.&ldquo;When we got there, we were told that they were offline and that we should try the next day,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Margaret said they decided to go and try at Mamelodi High School but they were referred to the same centre.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think they were tired of seeing us and they gave us an address in Sunnyside. I tried to explain that we were both blind, but they just said we should get our kids to accompany us,&rdquo; said Margaret.&nbsp;&ldquo;This new system was not planned with disabled people in mind. What will happen to kids whose parents are illiterate or disabled like us?&rdquo;&nbsp;Gauteng Education Department spokesman Oupa Bodibe said that the department would like all parents who are facing challenges with online applications to give them their contact details.&ldquo;We will assist with the necessary intervention. Our tollfree number is 0800 000 789,&rdquo; he said.
