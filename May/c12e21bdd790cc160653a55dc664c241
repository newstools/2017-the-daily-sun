A never-say-die attitude and absolute commitment has paid off for the University of Pretoria&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s hockey team.The Tuks team&rsquo;s performance over the past two weekends in the Varsity Tournament has been really impressive. In eight games they scored 28 goals and conceded only three. The team only lost one game. In Monday&rsquo;s semi-final in Potchefstroom, Tuks beat Wits 3-2. Inky Zondi (Tuks head coach) can justly feel like saying: &ldquo;I love it when a plan comes together.&rdquo;He realized from the start the importance for his team to put in a 100% effort every time they played. With each victory, they came closer to securing a home final. In Monday&rsquo;s semi-final against Wits Zondi proved his tactical wizardry. With about four minutes remaining the Wits players were launching attack after attack. They only needed to score one goal to secure a victory. That is when Zondi indicated that he wanted his team to take their &ldquo;power play&rdquo;. That meant Wits had to take two players out of the game for two minutes. In doing they lost their momentum in the attack.But Zondi isn&rsquo;t claiming the glory.&ldquo;It was the players who did the job. Any coach is only as good as his players. Over the past two weekends, every player did what was expected. That led to us being able to dictate the game each time we played.&rdquo;The final will be played on home ground next Monday.&nbsp;
