LENA van Zyl said she regrets the day she allowed her son&rsquo;s 17-year-old girlfriend to come for a visit. The mum (52), from Ferreira in Bloemfontein, told Daily Sun the girlfriend refuses to leave and since she had been living with the family, her son had stopped respecting her.Lena said she had explained to her son, Kathazile (22), that she didn&rsquo;t believe in &ldquo;vat en sit&rdquo; relationships, but he refused to send his girlfriend away. &ldquo;We used to live in peace and harmony before this girl came to our home. When she first arrived, she said she was just visiting but she&rsquo;s been here for nine months,&rdquo; said Lena. &ldquo;My son doesn&rsquo;t respect me any more. &ldquo;He swears at me every time I tell him to send this girl back home to Wepener. &ldquo;This girl doesn&rsquo;t have an ID and doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about school. &ldquo;I suspect she ran away from home because of something bad she did. I cannot allow her to come between my son and me. I want her out of our lives.&rdquo;Kathazile said: &ldquo;My mum is not telling the truth about my girlfriend. I am in the process of getting her an ID. She is not going anywhere because we are in love.&rdquo; The girlfriend, Puleng Ntatamane said she was living with her aunt in Wepener before she moved to Bloemfontein. &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t want to go back home. My aunt knows I&rsquo;m alive and I will be visiting home soon to get my birth certificate. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy here.&rdquo;
