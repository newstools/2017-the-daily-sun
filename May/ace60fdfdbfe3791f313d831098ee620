OWEN DA GAMA will have to vacate his post as Bafana Bafana assistant coach and coach of the SA Under-23 squad.&nbsp; This was revealed by new Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter at the weekend.&nbsp; Da Gama was appointed in July 2014 as former coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba&rsquo;s assistant and the SA U-23 coach.&nbsp; Baxter last Thursday named his 25-man squad to play Nigeria, in what will be a tough baptism for the Scot, in Uyo on 10 June in Bafana&rsquo;s opening 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.&nbsp; Baxter said he would bring in his own technical team. He explained: &ldquo;I have nothing personal or any malice towards Owen. It would not be right for me to have the person who was in the job before me as my assistant.&rdquo;Names such as Steve Komphela and Roger de Sa were mentioned but Baxter stated: &ldquo;We can throw in a lot of names, but yes, I would consider Steve if he was available. But he is under contract with Kaizer Chiefs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also stated he wanted to bring in a young coach as his second assistant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will be looking at a former Bafana player to mentor for the future,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He is likely to keep current SA Under-20 coach Thabang Senong and make him the new SA U-23 coach. Senong guided Amajita to the Fifa Youth World Cup which is being played at present in South Korea.&nbsp; Said Baxter: &ldquo;I like the fact that Thabo has got his side to the World Cup. I&rsquo;m not worried by the fact that the side bombed out after the first round. There were a lot of positives, and players gained valuable international experience which will benefit us in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said speculation that he wanted to bring his son Lee on board as the new goalkeeping coach was not true &ndash;&ensp;but did not ruled out Lee who works for SportSport United.&nbsp; Explained Baxter: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll appoint the best man for the job at the right price.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lee has worked hard over the last nine years and has done well at SuperSport. But the goalkeeper coach will be appointed on merit, not because he&rsquo;s my son.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he had consulted a number of club coaches before selecting his first squad, and would continue to have a dialogue with club coaches in future.&nbsp; Asked about his head coach salary, he told the Sunteam: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here for the money. I earn what top coaches get in South Africa.&rdquo;&nbsp;
