I tried to ask the mayor to ask him if there was no better way to confront residents than bringing in the cops. “But he grabbed me by my clothes and started to hit me with his head on my forehead. Then he continued to hit me with his fists.“He accused me of being on the side of people committing a crime, saying he didn’t have time for thugs who stole electricity. “I want to see justice being done. I am planning a lawsuit and I have opened a case.” Mogoje told Daily Sun: “Mafojane has opened a case against me. I won’t comment on the matter. We will meet in a court of law.”Police spokesman Captain Stephen Thakeng confirmed that a case of common assault was opened against the mayor but said no arrest had been made. “The docket will be taken to a senior prosecutor for a decision. We will also take statements from witnesses.”
