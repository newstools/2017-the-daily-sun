THREE men were arrested yesterday afternoon after a seven-hour hostage drama. Residents cheered as police and army staff brought out suspected hostage-takers from the Shoprite store at Nyanga Junction in Cape Town. According to cops, hostage negotiaters and special units had to be called in to deal with the situation. A 25-year-old security guard was apparently injured. Yesterday morning Jean-Pierre Smith, the Cape Town MMC for safety and security, said it was believed the men took hostages after a cash-in-transit robbery went wrong. Throughout the day, Duinefontein Road, which leads to the shopping complex, was closed to traffic. The incident came a day after a daring robbery in Delft which led to a security guard&rsquo;s death. Residents of Nyanga and Manenberg said they believed the thugs wanted to steal their grant money. As events were unfolding, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula shared his views on Twitter. He said: &ldquo;Those Nyanga Junction criminals are under our watch as we speak. They have taken people hostage.&rdquo; Constable Noloyiso Rwexana, police spokeswoman, said at one point the hostage-takers were shooting blindly at cops with high-calibre weapons. Yesterday afternoon, Mbalula finally confirmed the drama was over. He wrote on Twitter: &ldquo;The suspects at Nyanga Junction have been apprehended following a hostage situation. We can&rsquo;t be controlled by criminals.&rdquo;
