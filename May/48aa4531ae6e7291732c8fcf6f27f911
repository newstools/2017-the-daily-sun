WHEN Tsepang Mohlakwana&rsquo;s son (9) went missing last Tuesday, she hoped against hope she would see him again. But on Friday, she received the worst news. His body was found in a field in Lenasia, south of Joburg. The 22-year-old mum from Orange Farm told Daily Sun that Keketso&rsquo;s body was found by a passerby. She said she wanted her son&rsquo;s killers to be caught so they could face the full might of the law. Tsepang reported Keketso missing at the beginning of last week. After investigating, cops discovered the little boy had been kidnapped by a woman and two men who were driving a white taxi with no registration number and tinted windows. Keketso was playing outside Flamingo Primary School in Lenasia when he was approached by the three adults and dragged into the taxi. A case of kidnapping was opened but just days later, police got a call telling them a child&rsquo;s body had been found in the veld opposite Lenasia Secondary School, in extension 11B. The man who found the body was relieving himself in the veld. He told Daily Sun he was shocked when he saw the body of the young boy.&ldquo;I went to the school and told the teachers. They called the cops,&rdquo; he said. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela confirmed the body was found by a passerby. Police are now investigating a case of murder.
