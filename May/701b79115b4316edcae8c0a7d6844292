MAMELODI SUNDOWNS coach, Pitso Mosimane, is aware that a defeat to sleeping Soweto giants Orlando Pirates could seriously dent his hopes of defending the Absa Premiership title.&nbsp;Kick off is today at Orlando Stadium at 3pm.The Brazilians failed to win their last two league games, giving leaders Bidvest Wits an advantage to win their first ever league trophy.&nbsp;Downs lost 1-0 to Wits on Monday and drew 2-2 with Platinum Stars on Thursday.Downs are three points behind the Clever Boys on 51 points with four games to play.&nbsp;A win for Wits against the unpredictable Maritzburg United at Milpark&rsquo;s Bidvest Stadium, at the same time, could see Downs lose their grip on their title.This will be an interesting clash, considering Bucs will be eager to avenge the humiliating 6-0 defeat by the Brazilians in the first round at Loftus Stadium.&nbsp;Pirates fans couldn&rsquo;t stomach the defeat on the day and resorted to violence.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;We want to win the league all the time. But after a result like this, it&rsquo;s not good for us, to be honest.&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever happens from the other side, we need to win and concentrate on our games.&nbsp;&ldquo;Football is funny, you never know what will happen in the end. If we don&rsquo;t get the title, then it won&rsquo;t be a train smash.&nbsp;&ldquo;But it would be nice to get it. We&rsquo;ve got to give our best until the end, that&rsquo;s more important.&rdquo;Mosimane insisted that a defeat to Bucs won&rsquo;t be the end of their title defence.He admitted his players are anxious and that&rsquo;s why they failed to increase their four-match unbeaten run.&nbsp;&ldquo;They are nervous. It&rsquo;s normal, we are human beings. I wish I could say we know what to do, so there are no slip-ups.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our preparations are the same from the first to the last game. I can&rsquo;t control what happens on the pitch,&rdquo; he said&nbsp;His counterpart, Kjell Jonevret, hopes his players will create more scoring chances and emulate Wits.Said Jonevret: &ldquo;I hope we will go out there and play some good football.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should not be the team that kicks long balls.&rdquo;Jonevret was not keen to talk about the previous shock defeat to Downs as he was not yet in charge at the time.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about what&rsquo;s in the past. I can only talk about the time I have been here,&rdquo; said Jonevret.
