LEBOGANG Makwela is outraged that Mamsy Leshaba used Lebogang&rsquo;s photos to advertise her slimming products. Lebogang (34) from Hammanskraal, Tshwane was obese and decided to take steps to lose the excess weight. She said she joined a gym and worked hard to get rid of the weight by also watching her diet. Impressed with her results, said Lebogang, she decided to post her photos on Facebook. Unbeknown to her, her pictures were seen by Mamsy, from Steelpoort, Limpopo, who decided to use them to promote her slimming product. She took the photos and some of another woman, also not her client, and posted them on her page which advertises her slimming product.Mamsy denies misleading her clients by using Lebogang&rsquo;s photos. She claims to have mistaken Lebogang for one of her sister&rsquo;s customers. Lebogang does not buy Mamsy&rsquo;s story. She said: &ldquo;I was alerted by a friend on Monday who wanted to order the slimming products. She referred me to Mamsy&rsquo;s Facebook page. &ldquo;Lo and behold, there were my &lsquo;before&rsquo; and &lsquo;after&rsquo; photos.&ldquo;These are my pictures that I used to create a group page for people who want to lose weight. I worked hard and some stranger wants to take credit for it,&rdquo; said angry Lebogang.Mamsy said she has since removed Lebogang&rsquo;s photos.&ldquo;I apologised to her but she went on Facebook and sent me nasty messages that she wanted to teach me a lesson.&rdquo; Lebogang said Mamsy will not go unpunished.&ldquo;I am still seeking legal advice.&rdquo;
