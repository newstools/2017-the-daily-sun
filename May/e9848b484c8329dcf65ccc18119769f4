Having a catch-up with the girls is a fabulous way to wind down after a rough week.READ:&nbsp;HOW TO EAT HEALTHY FOOD AT WORKAdd good food, and maybe a couple of drinks too, and you&rsquo;re in for a real treat. But what are you to do when you&rsquo;re trying to stick to healthier foods? The answer: it&rsquo;s not only about eating healthily, but eating smartly. Here are some tips to show you how:&nbsp; 1. Read the menu carefully&nbsp; Gina Sunderland, who is a registered dietician, strongly recommends that you look out for words like &ldquo;pan-fried&rdquo;, &ldquo;crispy&rdquo; and &ldquo;dipped&rdquo; from the menu. These words indicate the amount of fats present in the dishes. Her word of advice is that you go for &ldquo;grilled&rdquo;, &ldquo;steamed&rdquo; and &ldquo;baked&rdquo; instead. 2. Salad first&nbsp; Start off your meal with a crunchy salad, rich in greens, tomatoes and carrots. In doing so, you&rsquo;re bound to feel fuller by the time your main meal arrives. 3. Starter + Starter = Meal&nbsp; In many cases, menus include sumptuous starters of veggies and seafood. &emsp;Combining a few should be sufficient to constitute a meal. &emsp;If you devour a couple of these, you&rsquo;ll be left with a happy, full belly. Because unless you&rsquo;re too hungry, or the portions are too small, you don&rsquo;t need a starter and a main meal. 4. Split the dessert&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to skip sweetness completely! Go easy on yourself and live a little! Cut down on your sugar intake by sharing dessert with a friend. Order one sinful sweet pudding to share with a friend. &emsp;This way, you&rsquo;ll save a few bucks too. And if you don&rsquo;t like to share, order a lower-calorie dessert choice like a sorbet or a non-dairy gelato. 5. Let water be your thirst quencher&nbsp; Water is the elixir of life. There couldn&rsquo;t be a better drink and if it&rsquo;s tap water, it will be free too! And there&rsquo;s another good reason &ndash; according to The New York Times, which reported that choosing water over other drinks makes you eat foods with more calories. 6 . . . if not, watch what you drink&nbsp; It&rsquo;s okay to occasionally spoil yourself with a tasty beverage instead of good plain healthy water. But when and if you do so, drink one with fairly low fat and sugar content. If you&rsquo;re having a glass of orange juice with your breakfast, The New York Times suggests having only half-a-glass in place of a full one. If you&rsquo;re sipping on a milky coffee, experts advise you to choose skimmed milk.The trick is balance. If you&rsquo;re very thirsty, have a glass of water first.
