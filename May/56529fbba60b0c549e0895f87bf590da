THE MOMENT of truth has finally arrived for South Africa&rsquo;s national Under-20 squad! Thabo Senong&rsquo;s charges will depart for South Korea for the Fifa Youth World Cup tonight. The event kicks off in less than two weeks&rsquo; time on 20 May. But the SA Football Association (Safa) is still scrambling to resolve the club-versus-county debacle with Bidvest Wits.There was no clarity yesterday on whether Wits would release duo Phakamani Mahlambi and Reeve Frosler for the event.Both are regular members of the Clever Boys head coach Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s squad and the club is serious about winning the PSL title this season. Wits are on course to bag the league title for the first time in the club&rsquo;s history and are therefore reluctant to release the two Amajita stars.Senong has been happy with the team build-up so far. Amajita showed a lot of improvement at their training camp in the Netherlands recently.This will be the third World Cup appearance for Amajita. In their last appearance in 2009 they were eliminated in the Last 16 round of competition. Senong said this time they hadn&rsquo;t set themselves a target. &ldquo;Playing in the World Cup is an achievement in its own. There are no targets set because it would put our players under unnecessary pressure and that is something we don&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; said Senong.He refused to comment on Mahlambi and Frosler, referring all enquiries to Safa&rsquo;s technical director, Neil Tovey.Tovey said yesterday: &ldquo;I cannot say much about this matter, we are still trying to sort it out.&rdquo;However, should Wits and Safa should not come to an agreement, Senong could be left with only 19 players for the tournament.Explained the former Bafana Bafana captain: &ldquo;The final list of players has been sent to Fifa and changes cannot be made at this stage. If the club does not release them it would be disappointing.&rdquo;The South Africans are in Group D with Japan, Italy and Uruguay.
