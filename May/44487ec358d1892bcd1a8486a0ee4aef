&ldquo;WE LIVE like animals. Every day and night, we walk around the farm looking for food!&rdquo; These were the words of five families that were evicted last year from farms they had lived on for many years. They told Daily Sun they have no water, toilets or electricity at their new homes. Their only source of income is their kids&rsquo; social grants! They were evicted from farms around Fouriesburg in Free State, and the Dihlabeng Municipality moved them to a farm between Fouriesburg and Bethlehem. Daily Sun first published a story about the eviction last June. Mofokeng Matshaya (35) said: &ldquo;We were moved to this farm after the municipality gave us temporary shelter on the Fouriesburg Showground.&rdquo; He said living at the showground was better as they had water, toilets and lights. Tshediso Maitse, the municipal spokesman, said the farm was used as a place of shelter for farm evictions victims, and that water tankers visited on a daily basis. &ldquo;At this stage, we can&rsquo;t provide electricity as we&rsquo;re in a legal dispute with the previous farm owner,&rdquo; said Maitse. There were plans to provide septic tanks and toilets.
