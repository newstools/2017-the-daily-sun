GWEN Ramokgopa said the Gauteng health department has closed 20 NGOs that used to house mentally ill patients. The health MEC spoke at a media briefing in Joburg yesterday about the relocation of patients to properly licensed facilities.About 750 patients were moved to three facilities over the past two months.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried at all times to be transparent, professional and cautious to ensure the patients&rsquo; health and well-being were not affected,&rdquo; she said.Some patients remain with NGOs. They&rsquo;ve refused to be moved, and in some cases their families didn&rsquo;t want to authorise the move.Some owners of NGOs have taken legal action against government.Ramokgopa said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing our best to attend to those issues. We&rsquo;re hopeful we will resolve them in the best interests of the patients.&rdquo; The transfer of patients from NGOs to licensed institutions follows the death of over 100 patients after they were moved from Life Esidimeni to community care NGOs in June last year in an effort to save money.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi then ordered the office of the health ombudsman, led by Prof Malegapuru Makgoba, to investigate the matter. This led to the resignation of health MEC Qedani Mahlangu.
