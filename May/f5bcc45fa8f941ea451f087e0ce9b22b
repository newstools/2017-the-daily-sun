DISGRACED former Kaya FM radio DJ, Katlego Mabusela, was allegedly turned down when he approached Bob Mabena.Bob left Kaya FM at the end of last month, for media company MSG Afrika Group, where he joined the company as its group head of programming in its broadcasting department.Katlego, who left the station under a cloud, is said to have approached the legendary Bob to seek employment at Power FM.Sources said Bob didn&rsquo;t hesitate to turn him down after allegations that he had left Kaya FM under a dark cloud.&ldquo;He thought Bob was going to give in simply because he used to like him a lot when he was still at Kaya.&ldquo;The guy let Bob down when he left Kaya FM. He waited for Bob to move from Kaya to join MSG before he could ask for a job. It&rsquo;s hard out there.&rdquo;&ldquo;You have to use each and every opportunity when you are on radio so that you will not starve. He thought he was going to make it easy without the radio,&rdquo; said the mole.&nbsp;Another mole said desperation was written all over Katlego&rsquo;s face.&ldquo;It was a shame that Bob had to take a decision on the spot. Katlego came back with his tail between his legs, because throughout the week, he had been bragging that Uncle Bob wouldn&rsquo;t turn him down.&rdquo;&ldquo;He thought Bob is just a boy, you can just manipulate with your unemployment stories. You can&rsquo;t do that to Bob because he knows what happened before Katlego left Kaya&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;When asked for comment, Bob said: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t spoken to Katlego in a while now. I last spoke to him before he was fired at Kaya FM. I don&rsquo;t know where he&rsquo;s at.&rdquo;Katlego said: &ldquo;As any radio professional would, I&rsquo;ve been in contact and conversation with a number of radio stations since my departure from Kaya FM.&ldquo;And yes, Bob is one of the people I reached out to.&rdquo;When asked why he waited for Bob to leave Kaya FM to approach him with a job request, Katlego said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a good relationship with Uncle Bob. He was one of the people who believed in and advised me while I was still at Kaya FM.&ldquo;Naturally, when I then found out about his new role at MSG, I reached out.&rdquo;&ldquo;I did take a few months away from mainstream activity for introspection after my Kaya FM contract was not renewed.&nbsp;On allegations that he was broke, Katlego said: &ldquo;Outside of radio, I&rsquo;m involved in multiple startups, and like any entrepreneur would tell you, this journey comes with its challenges.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been paid handsomely by radio, but I love the medium and understand its importance from a brand building point of view. I approached Bob because I love radio and welcome any chance to get back behind the mic.&rdquo;
