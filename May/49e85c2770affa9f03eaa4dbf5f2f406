FORMER SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng's disciplinary hearing will begin next Wednesday.The hearing stems from the findings former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela made against him in a report released in February 2014.Madonsela found that he lied about his qualifications, that he purged the SABC of staff, promoted staff and raised salaries, including his own, without having followed procedures.There would also be a parallel disciplinary process relating to his press conference on 19 April, when he hosted a five-hour long 'Hands off Hlaudi' press conference and ranted about the interim board.The hearing would have taken place last week, but was postponed at the request of Motsoeneng's attorneys due to his "ill health".The other disciplinary hearing follows the Western Cape High Court's dismissal of Motsoeneng's request for leave to appeal in February.The DA applied to have Motsoeneng's appointment as group executive for corporate affairs set aside.The court ruled in December that he could not go to work in any capacity at the SABC, pending the findings of a new disciplinary inquiry or a court review of parts of Madonsela's report on his conduct. Motsoeneng was removed as COO after the Supreme Court of Appeal in September rejected his bid to appeal the Western Cape High Court's November 2015 ruling declaring his appointment irrational and setting it aside.Khanyisile Kweyama, chairwoman of the interim SABC board updated the committee on the interim board's progress since it started its work in April.Apparently dodgy deals are being probed and the process to appoint a new CEO and COO had started.The SABC submitted a funding proposal to Communications Minister Ayando Dlodlo earlier on Wednesday.Kweyama, however, would not provide further details as she wanted to allow Dlodlo time to read the proposal first before it was made public.A figure of a R1 billion bailout had been reported recently.Kweyama said they wanted to restore the morale of SABC employees."Intimidation comes up a lot. It is up to us to show that we are there to protect against intimidation," she said.MPs from all parties welcomed Kweyama's presentation.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hlaudi-motsoeneng-to-face-disciplinary-hearing-20170510
