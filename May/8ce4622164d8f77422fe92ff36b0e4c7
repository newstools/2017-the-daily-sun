AN ANGRY President Jacob Zuma has threatened his detractors in the ANC not to "push him too far".&nbsp; Zuma addressed the party's national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Pretoria after surviving another motion for him to step down. The party's highest decision-making body between conferences debated the motion for two days, with the meeting ending late on Sunday evening.&nbsp; "He was very angry. It was the first time I have seen him so angry," said an NEC source.&nbsp;The source added that Zuma threatened ANC leaders in his closing address to stop criticising him in public as he will no longer continue to keep quiet.&nbsp;"I have been quiet because I don't want to harm the ANC, so continue attacking me in the media and you will see," Zuma is quoted saying to the ANC NEC.&nbsp; The president further warned the NEC that it should be the last time he faced a motion of no confidence.&nbsp;Zuma told the meeting he didn&rsquo;t understand calls for him to step down now as he was not standing for re-election at the party's elective conference in December.&nbsp;Zuma is also said to have slammed the Gauteng ANC for blaming him for the party&rsquo;s electoral decline, reminding the province that it had refused to distribute T-shirts bearing his name for the 2016 local government electoral campaign.&nbsp;He further blamed the party for losing the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality due to infighting that has plagued the ANC in the metro.&nbsp;Zuma also referred to an alleged plot to poison him in 2014, saying he knew who was behind the plot but did not want to harm the ANC.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-zuma-survives-bruising-anc-nec-meeting-20170528
