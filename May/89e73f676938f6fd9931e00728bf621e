UNSUSPECTING victims stopped the white Quantum taxi, hoping it would take them to their destinations. But it turned out they had boarded a ride to hell!The taxi would drive into the bush, where guns were pointed in the passengers&rsquo; faces and they were forced to hand over bank cards and PIN numbers!Another private car would then appear from out of the bush, heading for an ATM with their bank cards and PINs written on a piece of paper.The thugs would then withdraw cash with each card. Once they had the cash, their victims would be released in the bush.If no money was found, all hell would break loose!Men were moered and the women were forced into the bushes and threatened with rape.This is how witness accounts described the trauma of the white Quatum gang, which had been conducting their reign of terror since last year.But now that reign of terror is over!Ekurhuleni Metro cops bust the taxi last Wednesday.Clifford Shongwe of Ekurhuleni Metro Police said the Quantum was driving in Springs when it skipped a red robot.&ldquo;The cops instructed the taxi to stop, but it sped off.&rdquo; He said the taxi headed towards the KwaZenzele informal settlement in Endicott, Springs. Its occupants fired shots at the Metro cops, who returned fire.The Quantum drove into the squatter camp, but it ended up in a small dead-end passage and could not go forward. &ldquo;They abandoned the taxi and ran, but two suspects were arrested later when they returned to get the car radio.&ldquo;Another man who came forward claiming the taxi was his was also arrested and the taxi was taken to Springs police station,&rdquo; said Shongwe. He said the cops searched the Quantum and found IDs and bank cards.&ldquo;It was discovered that the IDs and cards belonged to victims who had been robbed by the gang operating from the taxi and who had opened cases at Springs police station,&rdquo; said Shongwe. Members of the community are advised to contact the Springs cop shop if they have been robbed by men driving in a white Toyota Quantum taxi.
