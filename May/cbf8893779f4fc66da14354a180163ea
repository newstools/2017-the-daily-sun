WHEN Meshack Gumbi was told that the welding company he was working for was going to close down in 1998, he didn&rsquo;t start worrying. He knew that he could use his skills to start his own business. The 52-year-old man from KwaMashu Men&rsquo;s Hostel is now known to meat lovers in his area as the master of braai stands.Meshack makes all sorts of different sizes. The father of two told Daily Sun that he started the business in 2000 after the company he worked for was closed. &ldquo;I worked for the Apex Company at KwaSithebe, Mandeni for 10 years doing welding, but unfortunately it closed and we became jobless. &ldquo;But I had enough experience to start my own business. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t attend any school to learn welding but learnt the skill while I was working for Apex. &ldquo;Now I do everything using steel. I decided to focus on braai stands because I know people love to braai meat. &ldquo;I can also make gates, windows, candle stands, irons, pot stands and burglar guards. The experience I obtained at Apex helped a lot.&rdquo;Meshack is originally from KwaMaphumulo, in the north of KZN, but he decided to stay in Durban because there are more customers there. &ldquo;During holidays I usually have many orders for braai stands. &ldquo;Since I started my business I have managed to support my family the same way I supported them when I was still employed.&rdquo; He has spent 17 years working in a small place outside the hostel. &ldquo;My welding passion keeps me going strong. I want to expand my business now and find a big place to run it.&rdquo;
