Model-turned-actress, Nandi Mbatha, says her role on Mzansi Magic&rsquo;s Isi Thembiso is a miracle and a dream come true.&nbsp;The 20-year-old from Newcastle in KZN plays Simi on the telenovela &ndash; a young village girl who comes to Jozi to study medicine.&nbsp;&ldquo;Simi is a sweet girl with a dream to become a doctor and hopes to make her grandmother proud. She tries to remain focused and is grabbing the opportunity to study with both hands,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Speaking to Sunday Sun, the newcomer said being on the show had been a humbling experience.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so humbling to see how people relate to my character.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m learning a lot from the storyline and my fellow cast members.&rdquo;&nbsp;Having modelled and participated in beauty pageants since she was in primary school, Nandi said her interest in acting was sparked by a question posed during one of the pageants.&nbsp;&ldquo;I remember being asked if I thought acting and modelling were similar and, when I took a moment to think, I realised they were.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when it dawned on me that it&rsquo;s something I could actually do. And from then on, I&rsquo;ve been working to pursue it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Auditioning for the role of Simi was a first-time experience for her and she managed to bag it.&nbsp;&ldquo;To land this role on such a big channel is really a miracle for a newbie like me.&nbsp;&ldquo;Working with the likes of Hamilton Dlamini and Meshack Mavuso was intimidating at first, but they share so much knowledge and want to see us, younger actors, doing our best. We&rsquo;re like family on set.&rdquo; Isi Thembiso airs on Mzansi Magic (DStv channel 161) every Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm.
