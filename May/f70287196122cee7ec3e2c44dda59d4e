BEFORE she was killed and burned, Karabo Mokoena (22) planned on giving young men a motivational talk.Karabo and her uncle, Tshepo Mokoena, were supposed to have launched the programme in July.&ldquo;She said, I want to come and speak to boys how to behave and to say no to certain things,&rdquo; Mokoena told the media yesterday during MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza&rsquo;s visit to the family. &ldquo;But now she can&rsquo;t be part of that.&rdquo; He added it was time that men told young boys that if a girl says no, they must just walk away. Men should think of starting a social media movement to raise issues of gender.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time men went to women to find out how we can start working together to ensure that what happened to Karabo does not happen again.&rdquo; Mayathula-Khoza said the department would like to help the family with counselling and psychotherapy.She said she sent social workers to visit the family. &ldquo;We came to pay tribute to Karabo. We are saddened by the senseless killing of someone showing she would have been a leader.&rdquo; A memorial service will be held on Wednesday and Karabo will be laid to rest on Friday.Meanwhile, according to reports, the 27-year-old murder accused told the court his family helped to clean up the house after the crime.
