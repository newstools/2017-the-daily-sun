BRIAN Molefe's skill-set must not be lost, but he must be removed as ESKOM chief executive. The African National Congress, National Executive Committee (NEC) decided this past weekend.One of the ANC sources told News24 that the NEC agreed Molefe&rsquo;s talents should not be lost. "Something must be found for him to ensure we do not lose him," the source said.Two ANC leaders, who asked to remain anonymous as they were not authorised to speak, told News24 today that the ANC&rsquo;s NEC agreed that Molefe had to be removed.Molefe returned to his former position at Eskom in May after his notorious R30 million early pension pay-out was cancelled.The board decision to bring him back has resulted in legal action, a Parliamentary inquiry and a Department of Public Enterprises inquiry into the matter.The ANC previously labelled his return to Eskom as "dangerous" and "reckless". Although the ANC has no power to appoint or remove officials, as the ruling party it can instruct its deployees in the executive to act on its decisions.Molefe resigned from Eskom in November 2016 following former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report.http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/anc-nec-molefe-must-leave-eskom-but-new-role-must-be-found-sources-20170529
