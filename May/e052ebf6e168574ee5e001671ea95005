THE train was on its way to KwaMashu on Wednesday night but never got there.It parked at Temple Station.Fed-up commuters allegedly burned three train coaches and assaulted guards and cops.Then they marched to Dumisani Makhaye Drive, where they allegedly blocked the road with burning tyres and stoned passing cars.Commuter Sandile Mchunu (39) told Daily Sun the train parked at 5.30pm without any explanation. After an hour, commuters became angry and started shouting.&ldquo;Some walked home. Others stayed, hoping they would be provided with transport,&rdquo; said Sandile. He said when no other transport was provided at 7pm, commuters became angry and started burning the coaches. &ldquo;This is unfair. We buy tickets for the whole month and don&rsquo;t have taxi fare.&rdquo; He said commuters wanted to show Prasa they were unhappy. Dumisani Mbili (50) said sometimes the train does not come at all. &ldquo;Earlier this month, we ended up sleeping at the train station,&rdquo; said Dumisani.
