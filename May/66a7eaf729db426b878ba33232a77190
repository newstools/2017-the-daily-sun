DIPUO Mkhabela believes a midnight prayer saved her life. The 33-year-old from Mmakaunyane in Winterveld, Tshwane, said she believed if she had not prayed before going to bed last Tuesday night, she would have been hit by one of the bullets fired at her house while she was sleeping. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t usually pray at midnight but something told me to kneel down and ask for God&rsquo;s protection,&rdquo; she said. Dipuo said after praying for an hour, she went to bed but she was woken by gunshots in the early hours of Wednesday morning. &ldquo;They were fired through my bedroom window. Three shots were fired.&rdquo; Dipuo said after everything was quiet again she rushed to her children&rsquo;s bedroom to check if they were safe. &ldquo;I found them sleeping, so I woke them up and warned them not to scream,&rdquo; she said. She then called tenants living in the yard of her rented house and they called the cops. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know whether we should shout or even move because we had no idea whether the shooters were still around or not.&rdquo; Dipuo said they only left the house after the police had arrived. She said she had no idea why someone would want to shoot at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have enemies. I never fight with people or even get involved in confrontations. I am shocked that people would want to kill me. &ldquo;It seems as if they wanted to kill me but because I prayed they couldn&rsquo;t enter the house.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Sergeant Thembi Nowate said a case of attempted murder was opened.&ldquo;No suspect was arrested. Investigations are still underway,&rdquo; she said.
