TRAFFIC came to halt when murdered lesbian Lerato Moloi (27) was buried on Saturday.Lerato’s friends walked 10km from Naledi Hall to Protea Glen Mall intersection to protest her brutal murder.As people watched from their homes, the group sang the famous struggle song, but adapted it to: “Senzeni na. Isono sethu ubutabane. (What did we do? Our sin is being lesbians.)”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsubTp0XA30882tr2umblHZFUaP3sHT-sti6q6TeYwaJ6E09U0RyTlAczI_hSxFULSC54CkjHdlUHeJNmO6n2qVf9di1bEf-Hk1gOVhgNoY7J6F6TwIzTlAA9JHiFpmSkxmKaQMtkVfydRwjKdvlLaIwi0bHvY1m7rPlw0pTxFyp9pEWHmlkDPHB0fUIfXbj5KdBLiuWKMos7E1OZHEeBB-ibH8nGqJ7eyYkaTUvYEHCHlyXWkArsIlAviBrxm-ZuEk68vkti9CxUVrVwHuv0_OMaF2R6NQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP8IAgOjOUM5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We want this to stop now. Today it’s Lerato, who knows who else it could be tomorrow? It could be me,” said Kgotso.The women said they had been to Kroonstad last week to bury another of their friends.The service started at the Moloi home and proceeded to the Naledi Community Hall, where scores of people including people from the the community, Lerato’s friends and government officials waited for them.Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said people should stop judging others and love one another unconditionally.“This thing of categorising people starts in our homes. When you see this child is smart, you love them.“ If they are a little bit slow, you don’t love them.“When she is a yellow bone, you love her, but if she’s black, you don’t.” She said it was time for South Africans to do what was right and love people equally.Speaker after speaker called for the return of the death penalty.The convoy then departed for Olifantsvlei Cemetery on the Golden Highway, south of Joburg where Lerato was laid to rest.Her friends marched in front of the convoy that shut down all the roads leading to the cemetery.
