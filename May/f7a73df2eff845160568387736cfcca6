AWARD-WINNING Afro-pop star Zahara is allegedly carrying umthwalo of her debt around the streets of Jozi.&nbsp; Sources close to the star say she skipped out of paying her drinks tab at a classy shisa nyama.&nbsp; Sunday Sun can reveal that Zahara and her publicist Oyama Dyosibo were out on the town recently and stopped off for a drink at Meat Lounge in upmarket Sunninghill, Jozi.&nbsp; Their bar tab came to R778. But sources close to the situation said Zahara didn&rsquo;t even have money for drinks.&nbsp; One source said Zahara and her publicist ordered a bottle of expensive wine Hamilton Russel Chad wine for R750 and one beer Heineken for R28. Oyama drank the beer, according to a source.&nbsp; Sunday Sun is in possession of the bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;But instead of paying after drinking, they walked away,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; Another source claimed that when&nbsp;the waiter realised they were running away, he called and asked them to pay.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zahara quickly said they were just going to the loo, and would come back to settle the bill,&rdquo; claimed the source.&nbsp; The source said the pair eventually came back from the loo with a long story.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told them she had left her wallet at home and would come back to pay,&rdquo; claimed the informant.&nbsp; When called for comment, Zahara told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oyama would know better if you ask him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the source added that Zahara and her companion never returned to the shisa nyama.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s happening with her,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; Yesterday, Oyama told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;I was hosted by the owner, hence we left without paying.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when the SunTeam got in touch with the manager, Michael Hlongwane, he was singing from a different hymnbook!&nbsp; Michael said refused to comment on the Zahara allegations, saying: &ldquo;The Meat Lounge does not discuss clients with the media.&rdquo;
