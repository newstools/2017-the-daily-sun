MANDLA Magandla (34) claims he could lose his left arm after cops allegedly marched on it! Mandla, from Mayfield, near Daveyton in Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun he was attacked last month after the shop in Alexandra, Joburg where he works as a store manager was burgled. &ldquo;Thugs stole money from the safes,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It happened at night while everyone was at home. &ldquo;When I arrived at work the following day, officers took statements from me and other employees.&ldquo;But after I knocked off, eight drunk cops came to my house and accused me of being behind the burglary.&rdquo; Mandla claimed they tied his hands behind his back with cable ties and made him lie down. &ldquo;They started beating me and stomping on me. I&rsquo;ve never endured so much pain in my life. They took turns parading on me with their heavy boots.&rdquo; Mandla said he pleaded with the officers to arrest him and prove he was connected to the burglary but they kept telling him he knew too much.He claimed he was then thrown into a Quantum taxi and driven to Alexandra, where they fetched some of his colleagues. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t do anything to the other employees but kept beating me. I was thrown into police cells for five days without receiving medical attention. My arm and ribs were left broken,&rdquo; he said. Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini said the case was reported to them and would be investigated.
