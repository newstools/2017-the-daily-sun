BISHOP Malusi Mpumlwana has described Mzansi as a failed state.The general secretary of the South African Council of Churches told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We have come to recognise that South Africa may be just a few inches from the throes of a mafia state, from which there may be no return.&rdquo;Mpumlwana was speaking during the council&rsquo;s report to the church public on the Unburdening Panel Process at Regina Mundi Church in Rockville, Soweto yesterday.He said the process undertaken by the churches was triggered by revelations made by former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas and ANC member Vytjie Mentor about the power of the Guptas, and state capture. &ldquo;What is crystal clear is that South Africa is in desperate need of divine intervention.&ldquo;We need prayer and action to work and reverse the national hurdle of mis-governance and chaos.&rdquo;The function was attended by many ANC heavyweights, including Pravin Gordhan, Reverend Frank Chikane, Anwa Dramat and many other unhappy top ANC members. &ldquo;We urge the ANC to examine itself and mend the ways of government before the country reaches the point of no return,&rdquo; said Mpumlwana.
