JOBURG mayor Herman Mashaba delivered his state of the city address yesterday, but the ANC was not pleased. The party&rsquo;s spokesman, Jolidee Matongo, said Mashaba had not lived up to the promises he made in a 10-point plan he shared when he became mayor nine months ago. &ldquo;The cancellation of the Jozi@Work programme has condemned 8 000 people to unemployment and prevented a further 50 000 Joburg residents from benefiting from the programme in the next four years,&rdquo; Matongo said. &ldquo;Mashaba has been chasing corruption ghosts and we&rsquo;re yet to see evidence of investigations done by him,&rdquo; he said. Mashaba&rsquo;s spokesman Tony Taverna-Turisan said progress had been made in achieving the goals set out in the 10-point plan. &ldquo;Much of this will be fully expressed in the budget to be announced later this month.&ldquo;We want residents to live in a well-run city where they don&rsquo;t have to worry about potholes and broken street lights&rdquo; said Taverna-Turisan.
