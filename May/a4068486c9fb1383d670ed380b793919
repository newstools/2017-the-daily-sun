PUBLIC Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown today ordered the Eskom board to cancel the reappointment of Brian Molefe as chief executive.Brown has asked the Eskom board to provide her with two names from the Eskom executive to become acting chief executive. She will announce who that acting CEO will be within 48 hours&rsquo; time, she said.&ldquo;We met with the Eskom board today,&rdquo; she said at a media conference in Cape Town. &ldquo;Collectively, looking at all the facts&hellip; I directed Eskom to rescind the decision to reappoint Mr Molefe.&rdquo;This follows the announcement by the inter-ministerial committee that it concluded that Brown should order the board to reverse the reappointment.&ldquo;It will be in the best interests of government, Eskom and the country that the Minister of Public Enterprises directs the board to rescind [reverse] the re-appointment of Mr Molefe,&rdquo; said inter-ministerial committee convenor Justice Minister Michael Masutha.The decision by the Eskom board to grant Molefe early retirement and then the decision to reappoint him were two mistakes that could have been prevented, the committee found."Both mistakes could have been corrected administratively and not by the board reinstating Mr Molefe," said Masutha.The inter-ministerial committee was appointed by President Jacob Zuma in May and consists of Masutha, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and Energy Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi.It was tasked with investigating Molefe&rsquo;s return to Eskom, after Brown agreed to the Eskom board&rsquo;s decision to reinstate him in May.Molefe told media yesterday that he wasn&rsquo;t worried about his fate as chief executive. "Whatever happens, happens," he said.Molefe agreed to return to Eskom after Brown discovered he had been granted a R30 million early pension payout by Eskom, which she refused to accept.She asked the board to find another solution, and his reinstatement was the result of this. The ANC previously labelled Molefe's return to Eskom as "dangerous" and "reckless". Brown was summoned to Luthuli House to meet with the party's top six and ordered to reverse Molefe's return.&nbsp;http://www.fin24.com/Economy/Eskom/breaking-brown-orders-eskom-board-to-reverse-molefe-reappointment-20170531&nbsp;
