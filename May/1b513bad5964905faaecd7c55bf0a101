THERE was a Hollywood-style jailbreak drama early yesterday morning at the Mthatha High Court. Thirteen dangerous awaiting-trial prisoners tried to escape! But heavily armed national intervention unit officers reacted quickly, shooting dead one prisoner and helping warders recapture the other 12.The prisoners were being escorted from Wellington Prison in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape to appear for their robbery trial. They were being held in connection with a 2015 armed robbery at Libode Post Office, where a cop was killed.Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela said a 38-year-old prisoner stabbed an officer in the arm with a knife as the cops were planning to put them in the holding cells before their court appearance.The prisoner and his accomplices ran from the court, using a back gate. But the men in blue chased after them. Cops managed to catch the 12 men. The escape mastermind was shot dead. No civilians were injured, but the court was closed for cleaners to remove bloodstains.Fatyela said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where the dead man got the knife, but we will investigate.&rdquo; He said that the 12 men would face the initial charges, as well as additional charges of attempting to escape from custody.In September 2014, cash-in-transit kingpin Sakhumzi Mvoko and Yandisa Bila shot an officer at the same court, but they both died in a hail of bullets in the ensuing gunfight.In December 2015, eight prisoners overpowered cops and drove off through the court&rsquo;s back gate. They were recaptured later that day.
