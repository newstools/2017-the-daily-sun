DRUG addicts are known for their reckless behaviour. But the latest trend among nyaope boys has shocked many . . . They have allegedly been stealing the ashes of dead people to smoke! Cases of nyaope addicts who allegedly stole boxes containing the ashes of cremated people have been registered at Mooifontein Cemetery in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni and Avalon Cemetery in Soweto. Workers at both cemeteries told the SunTeam many graves had been vandalised, supposedly by nyaope smokers looking for ashes. Families whose loved ones are buried in the cemeteries have asked the government to tighten security. Norkem Park Police Station spokesman Captain Lesibana Molokomme said a number of cases had been opened over graves being vandalised at Mooifontein Cemetery. &ldquo;We have opened over five cases of vandalism,&rdquo; he said. Three suspects had been arrested but the cases were still in court. Molokomme couldn&rsquo;t confirm that the graves were vandalised by nyaope addicts looking for human ashes to smoke. Funeral Industry Regulatory Authority chairman Johan Rousseau said the government needed to take action against vandals. Joburg City Parks spokeswoman Jenny Moodley said they had not received any complaints about stolen ashes.
