THE South African Weather Service has issued a warning that a cold front will be hitting parts of the country from tonight. The cold front was expected to arrive over the Cape yesterday and was expected to bring light rain and cooler temperatures. Forecaster Mbavhi Maliage said cold temperatures could be expected in Joburg today.&ldquo;There might also be showers and rain tomorrow morning in Cape Town, which could then head to Joburg. There will also be cool weather conditions and some rain in most parts of KZN this weekend,&rdquo; she said. The weather service said Eastern Cape might experience light snow today. &ldquo;Tomorrow further snowfalls can be expected in this region, spreading to include the extreme eastern Free State,&rdquo; said Maliage. However, she said by Monday temperatures were expected to rise again. Many regions will experience sunny, mild weather, although the Drakensberg will remain clear but cold. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said as winter was often cold and dry in Joburg there was a high risk of fire. &ldquo;During this season we see an increase in the number of fire cases we respond to, especially in informal settlements,&rdquo; he said. Mulaudzi urged residents to make sure safety measures are taken when they use candles, paraffin stoves and heaters.For life-threatening emergencies call 10177 on a landline, 112 on cellphones or 011 375 5911.
