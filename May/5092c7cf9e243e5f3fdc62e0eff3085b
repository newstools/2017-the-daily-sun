YOUNG girls are gifts from God and they need kindness and attention to grow. To help them grow well, Phindile Shwabede (38) formed a cultural dance group called Izithelozabazali with her two daughters and two other girls.Originally from KwaMaphumulo in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, Phindile landed in the Joburg CBD and set about showing that Zulu cultural music is alive and kicking.&ldquo;My producer, who trained me, is Zama Khumalo. Mzwakhe Mbuli bought the uniforms for the girls to perform in the halls and the busy streets of Jozi,&rdquo; said Phindile.Her daughters are Sibongakonke (14) and Sthembeleni Zungu (12).The other two girls, daughters of her friends, are Zama Vilakazi (20) and Yolanda Mlisa (14).&ldquo;Teaching the girls about their culture will make them strong in life,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s also a sign of bonding with them.&rdquo;The group aims to record their cultural CD soon.Philisiwe Ndlovu from Philisiwe music promotion has been a great help, said Phindile, and has motivated the group.Philisiwe told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Young girls are active and must be given support. &ldquo;Music keeps the kids healthy and helps them to stay focused.&ldquo;I started singing with the two maskandi stars, Mgqashiyo Ndlovu (who was in a wheelchair) and Tholakele Malunga,&rdquo; said Philisiwe.&ldquo;I later sang with my sister, Shiyendawo Shwabede.&ldquo;She is now married and lives in North West.&rdquo; The group rehearses in Philisiwe&rsquo;s flat in the Joburg CBD.
