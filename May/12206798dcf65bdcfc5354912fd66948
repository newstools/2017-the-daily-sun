We as residents are here to fight for her.&ldquo;We feel that her family failed her by letting something like this happen to her over and over again,&rdquo; said Phillip.The suspect was arrested at his home with the help of the extension 15 community.It is alleged that he had been raping his daughter for the past four years.A neighbour said: &ldquo;We approached the family a long time ago after we heard rumours.&ldquo;The mother was scared to talk to us. That is when we knew something was happening.&rdquo; The girl opened up to a teacher about what had been happening to her at home.The teacher took her to a doctor, who reportedly confirmed that she had been raped. This led to the man being arrested.He made a brief appearance in court yesterday and the case was postponed to Monday for a formal bail application.
