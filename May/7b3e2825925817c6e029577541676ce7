Dear MizzB I am a 15-year-old boy and I am worried about the upcoming exams. Is it safe to study through the night before exams? - Student Dear StudentIt&rsquo;s good that you are asking this question because many pupils use this method to study. Cramming in information the night before is a bad idea and will cause you problems in the long run. When you cram, you overwhelm your mind with a lot of information in one go. This can lead to mental exhaustion that will cause a mental block during your exams. It is wise to prepare in advance for your exams by starting to study at the beginning of every term. This will help create good habits and a timetable that will ease you into your exams. At that point you will be revising and you will know which subjects need your attention.
