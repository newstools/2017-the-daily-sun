THEY roam the streets of the squatter camp like scavengers.&nbsp; The horny single men wait for women&rsquo;s husbands to disappear and then they pounce.&nbsp; But the situation has now become an open war and husbands of Zenzele squatter camp in Mayfield, Ekurhuleni have vowed to kill single men preying on their wives.&nbsp; Last week, Willius Mpanzi beat a man after seeing his 39-year-old wife disappearing into the man&rsquo;s shack.&nbsp; Willius told Daily Sun he made the discovery after Johanna took a long time fetching water and he went looking for her.&nbsp; Willius claimed he found his wife in his neighbour&rsquo;s arms when he went to see what she was doing at his house.&nbsp; He got so angry he beat the man before calling other residents to join in.&nbsp; His neighbour managed to escape and has not been seen since.&nbsp; When the SunTeam spoke to Johanna, she admitted that she was caught with her neighbour but said he had forced himself on her.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told me to come and fetch some money while I was walking past his shack.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when I got inside he locked the door,&rdquo; said Johanna.&nbsp; She denied sleeping with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sleep with him and I never imagined he would take advantage of me like that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Community leader Minkie Maphosa said: &ldquo;We have a problem with men who live alone and are stealing other people&rsquo;s wives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Willius said he was disturbed by the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want that man to pay damages to cleanse my bed because he was disrespectful.&rdquo;&nbsp; One woman from the area said she saw nothing wrong with single men satisfying married women.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of us are in marriages where our husbands don&rsquo;t satisfy us.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes sleep with these men when my husband is at work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
