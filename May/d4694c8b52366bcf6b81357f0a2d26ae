PASTOR Willbro Ngwane’s church tent had barely risen on the piece of land when “block chairmen” came along with demands for payment!The pastor says he paid the first R1 500 they demanded, because he believed their claim that they represented the local councillor.But when they came again, with a demand that had shot up to R6 000, he refused to pay – and his church went up in flames!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvm5uWgS5JJXU1jn4b7SKQyDpsvEMcePJvCcjWo9_11GXJFCy_UEW7uILy4NQBIR6yceB3xB_QGYvYASkPaHoMC9cTTLsvLM3It4nwR5-kK-n3QXGSB3fhSPAeIOxkvJtO1fQ0BBuBCcy7zurxzrS7n8hGu9Vftvg7xWaI-weMeKEc0dLrvdcz7-wUxqXNlGaBwnksspYnaZZR4DYvd1nJNEsG161jSNU8xs_YFpfU6swTP1tyKC93fEizgeRZI6OTRx_3Bqgm_q8hrNNc5RvjpQjf1arc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFyeC-BuGxx2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When I tried to verify it with the councillor, he distanced himself from the matter.” Ngwane said that after that incident he received threats that his church would “leave the area in a painful way”.He said: “These threats came from unknown passersby as well as via private phone calls.”KZN police spokesman Thulani Zwane said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Umlazi cop shop. “No arrests have been made. The matter is still under investigation,” he said.Ngwane told Daily Sun his church would hold its service on Sunday as usual. “We will praise God here even if it means we have to do it under the trees,” he said. Councillor Mbangeni Mjadu said he knew nothing about the cash which was allegedly collected from the pastor: “I have never sent anybody to collect money from the pastor.”
