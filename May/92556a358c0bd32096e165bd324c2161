THERE was chaos at a Durban high school yesterday . . . Teachers allegedly wanted their acting principal to go, but parents wanted him to stay!The parents claimed they had seen changes since the acting principal took over last year, and that the matric results had improved. They claimed teachers were pushing personal agendas at the expense of their children&rsquo;s education.Parent Senzo Nhlawuzana (38) said teachers don&rsquo;t want the acting principal because he is too strict.&ldquo;That is exactly what we want, because we have seen matric results going up in a period of a year,&rdquo; said Senzo.The school obtained a 48,7% pass mark last year, compared to the previous 38% when the former principal was running the school.Senzo said teachers should iron out their differences and learn to work together. He said the teachers were ungovernable in the past.He said they used to come to school late and left early, and the former principal failed to stop that.But SGB chairman Bongizwe Ngcobo took the teachers&rsquo; side. &ldquo;The teachers get sick because the acting principal sprinkles muthi on the school grounds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe that being strict is a solution because our teachers become scared. He must go.&rdquo;The acting principal refused to comment.KZN education spokesman, Muzi Mahlambi, said: &ldquo;We have asked the teachers and the SGB to give us proof of the witchcraft allegations, but they have failed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve charged them with misconduct. We&rsquo;ll take action against them because they are tarnishing the acting principal&rsquo;s name and disrupting the process of teaching and learning.&rdquo;
