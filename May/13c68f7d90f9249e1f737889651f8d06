TWO SABC executives, Maijang Mpherwane and Nomsa Piliso, are allegedly accused of travelling to Los Angeles, in the US, two weeks ago, to attend a party of The Bold And The Beautiful.This while the public broadcaster faces a major financial crisis.According to sources, Maijang and Nomsa are accused of spending money recklessly by attending the glamorous event.&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that important for them to go on an overseas trip when the SABC is currently swimming in debt. They should have declined the invite, as it paints a wrong picture about the SABC,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;It simply says the SABC doesn&rsquo;t care about its financial status. It&rsquo;s emerged that they&rsquo;re hoping to ask Treasury for a bailout. It&rsquo;s unfair, as the SABC owes many productions houses.&rdquo;But SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, dismissed the claims as untrue.&ldquo;The people who attended this got invites and all expenses were paid for. It&rsquo;s a contractual agreement with The Bold and the Beautiful, and two SABC employees were catered for,&rdquo; Kganyago said.He said the show was celebrating 30 years, and &ldquo;all other things are just rumours from a malicious person&rdquo;.Another source said the production house for the The Bold And The Beautiful would have understood had they turned down the invite.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just greedy. They don&rsquo;t care about production. Not that everyone is unaware what&rsquo;s happening at the SABC. They keep spending instead of saving and paying stakeholders. "Actors haven&rsquo;t been paid and this poses a threat to production houses, operating on tight budgets. We&rsquo;re not sure if they&rsquo;ll be paid,&rdquo; said another mole.Nomsa and Maijang were not available for comment.This is an annual thing.&nbsp;
