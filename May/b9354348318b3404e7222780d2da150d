THE Dlamini family&rsquo;s misery is far from over. This comes after the municipality failed to deliver on its promise to release their relative&rsquo;s body. Dumisani Dlamini (22) of Section A3 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, was killed by a crowd in September and given a pauper&rsquo;s burial in March because no one claimed his body. His family learned of his death months later and preparations to give him a dignified funeral began. The Dlaminis said Dumisani&rsquo;s body was supposed to be exhumed for reburial last Wednesday, but Tshwane Municipality cancelled at the last minute.Dumisani&rsquo;s gogo, Martha Makhubo (67), said the municipality assured them that the body would be delivered on 26 April. &ldquo;We made preparations hoping that we would finally be able to move on, knowing that he was at rest among his ancestors.&rdquo; But her heart was broken when the family received the news on the morning of the burial that they would have to wait for another eight weeks!&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve run out of money and all the delays are affecting my health,&rdquo; said Martha.Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said there were processes that had to be followed and that the family had been made aware of these.&ldquo;The undertaker is in the process of acquiring the death certificate, but since the young man was buried without fingerprints and as a pauper, his fingerprints must first be verified by Home Affairs. That will take eight weeks,&rdquo; he said.
