THE Lejage family is offering R1&thinsp;000 as a reward for help to find their son.&nbsp; Karabo Lejage (21) went missing in February after he was allegedly snatched by security guards at a mall in Soweto.&nbsp; The guards accused Karabo, of Dobsonville in Soweto, of having stolen a bicycle two weeks earlier.&nbsp; His brother Tumelo Lejage (23) said he was with him at the time of the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have a stand where we sell food and the guards came there and accused my brother of stealing a bicycle. They said they were taking him to the guard room at the mall and were going to open a case against him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later that day Tumelo, with his father Edward Lejage (54), went to the mall to check on Karabo.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was told by the guards that he had been taken to the Dobsonville Police Station. We went there to check on him but were told there was no record of him being there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear something bad may have happened to him. I can&rsquo;t eat or sleep. My son just vanished. He used to tell me his every move even when he was spending time at his mother&rsquo;s house. I pray that he is safe, wherever he is.&rdquo;&nbsp; An employee at the mall said they were aware of the incident. She said Karabo had been taken to Dobsonville cop shop by the guards even though they did not open a case.&nbsp; However Aubrey Moopeloa, SAPS spokesman, said they had no record of the boy being arrested.&nbsp; Instead the police are investigating a case of a missing person opened by his father.&nbsp; &ldquo;If the family is not happy with how the case is being handled, they should contact the station commander,&rdquo; said Moopeloa.
