GOGO Liza Matabane hopes that when she dies, she will be buried next to her husband .But it seems as if the 64-year-old&rsquo;s wish may never happen.An unknown gravestone was placed on her husband&rsquo;s grave two years ago. Her husband&rsquo;s name was Ernest Matabane, but the name on the tombstone is Podile.The gogo from Naledi in Soweto said: &ldquo;I was very heartbroken to see that and for the past two years I&rsquo;ve been trying to get the officials at Avalon Cemetery to remove the tombstone. I can&rsquo;t even clean or visit the grave because I don&rsquo;t know who is in there.&rdquo; The gogo claimed that she also found out that her husband&rsquo;s name had been scratched off the record book.City Parks marketing manager Jenny Moodley said: &ldquo;There have been delays in locating the family that erected the headstone.&rdquo;Once contact is made, she said, both families would meet to discuss the matter.For any concern regarding burials, contact Reggie Moloi on 082 803 0655 or email him on rmoloi@jhbcityparks.com.
