&ldquo;HOW are cops supposed to catch thugs driving BMWs when they&rsquo;re driving slow old cars?&rdquo;CPF member Bongani Maqungwana questioned Police Minister Fikile Mbalula on Wednesday during his visit to Nyanga cop shop, near Cape Town.Maqungwana said another issue is cops&rsquo; transport to and from work. He said it is unprofessional to see officers standing on pavements waiting for taxis.&ldquo;The police shouldn&rsquo;t be transported by thugs and are easy targets.&rdquo; Nyanga CPF chairman Sandile Matini said the cop station in their area has remained unchanged for years.He said the problem was that detectives&rsquo; offices were too small and should be rebuilt so that interviews could be confidential. &ldquo;If we could have a new station, it would be better.&rdquo; Neighbourhood watch members asked the minister for training so they can protect themselves as they do not get police back-up. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t feel safe,&rdquo; said Khanyiso Mruqelo.One resident complained that cops don&rsquo;t respond urgently when they report crime. &ldquo;They ask for your name and surname and where you live. After that they tell the thug you reported them and that thug will look for you. If you report a crime, they ask your name and when you drop the phone, they just don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Mbalula said there was no money for new cars or police stations. &ldquo;The police must take care of themselves as thugs shoot first. Thugs must know we are coming for them.&rdquo;
