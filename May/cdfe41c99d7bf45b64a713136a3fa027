PARENTS&rsquo; demands for extra teachers at Emisebeni Junior Primary School in Mofolo, Soweto were partly met during a meeting yesterday of teachers, parents, Councillor Johannes Mofokeng and district officials. The school has eight teachers, including the principal, for 382 pupils. Education department spokesman Oupa Bodiba said department policy does not permit the school to get more teachers because of the pupil-teacher ratio. However, in a meeting held yesterday, the department relented and promised to hire one extra teacher for the school. Deputy SGB chairman, Lucky Mngomezulu (52), believes the lack of teachers creates a challenge for the pupils. &ldquo;Effective teaching is not taking place in the classrooms, which frustrates the pupils,&rdquo; he said.On Tuesday parents gathered at the school to raise their concerns. Parent Vuyokazi Ndlovu (45) said her kids complain that teachers rush through their lessons as they have other classes waiting to be taught as well.&ldquo;That is not right.&rdquo;
