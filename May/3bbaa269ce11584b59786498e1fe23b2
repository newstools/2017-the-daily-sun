COSATU has accused Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille of not doing enough to deal with the water crisis.Tony Ehrenreich, the federation&rsquo;s Western Cape general secretary, said: &ldquo;The water shortage is a disaster in the province and De Lille doesn&rsquo;t have measures in place to deal with the problem.&ldquo;The key responsibility of the mayor is to lead this place. If she can&rsquo;t, she must step down.&rdquo; Last week the City of Cape Town said water levels stand at 22,8%. With the last 10% of a dam&rsquo;s water mostly not useable, dam levels are effectively at 12,8%. The remaining water will last less than three months.Last week the municipality reduced the daily consumption target from 700 million litres to 600 million litres. The latest consumption is 680 million litres a day.Councillor Xanthea Limberg, the mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, said: &ldquo;We are trying to find ways to save more water. We are finalising proposals for further water restrictions. &ldquo;In the meantime, we repeat our plea for residents to stop using municipal water outside, including watering the garden and filling up pools.&rdquo;The mayor&rsquo;s spokeswoman, Zara Nicholson, said: &ldquo;We invite Ehrenreich to come for a meeting so that we can explain to him what we&rsquo;re doing about the crisis.&rdquo;In March, Ehrenreich threatened that Cosatu would march against De Lille for failing to deal with the water crisis. He said the rich are wasting water and the poor suffer. He said even if the rich are fined by the city for wasting water, they have lots of money so they will not feel the pain.&ldquo;The rich can offord to pay fines and more expensive water bills. Water shortages are going to lead to poor people dying of thirst.&rdquo;
