THE RIVALRY between South African featherweight contenders Rofhiwa &ldquo;War Child&rdquo; Maemu and Prince &ldquo;Fresh Prince&rdquo; Ndlovu is on full display two weeks before their African Boxing Union (ABU) championship contest.The two Limpopo boxers &ndash; Maemu hails from Hamavhuanda Village in Venda and Ndlovu from Seshego in Polokwane &ndash; will lock horns for the ABU featherweight title at Blairgowrie Recreational Centre on 11 June.This will be the second meeting for these fighters &ndash; Ndlovu won their first encounter on points. Now the Gauteng based Maemu has warned his arch-rival to expect war as he intends to level the score. &ldquo;Prince won our first encounter seven years ago when I was still inexperienced. This time he must be ready for a real war. A lot has changed. &ldquo;I have gained a lot of experience and he should be prepared for a real battle,&rdquo; said Maemu.The 25-year-old who is also eyeing the national title held by unbeaten Eastern Cape prospect Azinga Fuzile, believes he is hungrier than his opponent. &ldquo;Beating him will open more doors for me and give me an opportunity to be crowned champion,&rdquo; said Maemu.Hitting back, Ndlovu said he would repeat his performance of seven years ago. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see this boy taking that belt. I have beaten him before and will do it once more.&ldquo;I have been in camp here in Gauteng for the past three weeks to prepare against quality sparring partners. I will be crowned champion come fight day,&rdquo; he said.A win is important for both boxers, as neither have won anything big in their boxing careers. Ndlovu has a Limpopo provincial crown to his name. He has failed twice his quest for title glory, losing his SA title fight to Oscar Chauke and the International Boxing Federation Africa crown to Sydney Maluleke. Maemu lost his bid to become World Boxing Federation intercontinental champ, suffering a unanimous points defeat to Free State&rsquo;s Tello Dithebe.
