FIRST they robbed him and took his belongings, then they forced him to hold on to live izinyoka cables. Horrified residents of Zandspruit in Honeydew, Joburg stood staring at the body of the 55-year-old man with his hands still clenched on the cables. &ldquo;We are shocked and disgusted at how cruel these thugs have become,&rdquo; said community leader Kenneth Lekalakala. Lekalakala said the man worked at one of the factories in Honeydew. The body of the man was lying next to the footpath used by the residents to enter the squatter camp. Daily Sun saw the cables lying in the squatter camp. A resident claimed it was not the first time this had happened. &ldquo;You never know when and where these people are hiding. They rob innocent residents and force them to hold on to these live wires to die,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They have deprived this man&rsquo;s children of their father. &ldquo;P eople are ready to kill each other for something like a cellphone. &ldquo;The world is ending!&rdquo; Residents are blaming the Joburg Municipality for not electrifying their squatter camp. &ldquo;Thugs are taking advantage of these cables because the municipality is too slow to act,&rdquo; said a resident. &ldquo;Joburg Municipality promised to electrify the squatter camp but told us we had to be patient.&rdquo; An inquest docket was opened at Honeydew Police Station.
