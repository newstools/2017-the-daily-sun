GET ready to spice up your Sunday with Afro-pop group Encore!&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s show will serve as the precursor to Encore&rsquo;s upcoming tour, titled: Up Close and Personal.&nbsp;Billed under the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; label, popular Kaya FM host, Thabo &ldquo;Tbose&rdquo; Mokwele, said he was very thrilled to be part of the show.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m such a huge fan of Encore&rsquo;s music, and being among the friends who will play alongside this amazing group is refreshing,&rdquo; Thabo said of the I Got You hitmakers.&nbsp;&ldquo;This Afro-soul genre is usually dominated by talented Xhosa and Zulu musicians. But these Tswana boys have &emsp;taken it to another level &ndash; and they&rsquo;ve done it impressively, in their own tongue.&rdquo;&nbsp;Reflecting on the first time he got a taste of Encore&rsquo;s music, Tbose said he was convinced the group was onto something special.&nbsp;Said Tbose: &ldquo;It was at a Soul Session in Mofolo, Soweto. A DJ named Zozo Mafate played the song Ke Fela Pelo &ndash; and also sang along to it.&nbsp;&ldquo;This sparked my curiosity. I mean, this guy was singing along to a new hot song that wasn&rsquo;t even on radio!&nbsp;I asked him about it, and he was kind enough to give me the name of the artist and the title of the song.&nbsp;&ldquo;Thereafter, I immediately called the station&rsquo;s music compiler, France Nare, and asked if he knew Encore. He replied that he did know them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Tbose then invited Encore to his radio show, My Top Ten, for what turned out to be one of his most amazing interviews.&nbsp;Speaking about his DJ set, Tbose said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t plan my set, I just get to the venue with my CD bag and feed off the crowd&rsquo;s energy.&nbsp;&ldquo;The audience should expect an amazing show.&rdquo;&nbsp;The event will take place today at Da Side in Randfontein, West Rand. A cover charge of R100 gets you into the venue, and the gates open from 2pm until late.&nbsp;
