Besides the lahla'mkhonyanas, the sparaparas and the two-finger experts,&nbsp; there is some nice things on a train.&nbsp; Those who travel by Metrorail Gado everyday know that there is another world in the coaches of these trains.In one coach, every morning and afternoon, make no mistake, you will find a bible-wielding pastor&nbsp; screaming at the top of his voice, reminding everyone about their sins and telling them to repent before it's too late. Just next to him, there will be a group of guys playing cards, others dice and - not really concerning themselves with what the Man of God is saying.And then there will always be that someone who makes jokes about &nbsp;what the pastor is saying......leaving those who hear him laughing out loud......And then there's those Mamas in the pastor's audience who will give them that 'Mntanam, you are going to hell' look. At the same time, the vendors will be going up and down, selling almost everything, from amagwinya to airtime and cell phone chargers. Now these&nbsp; guys make all kinds of unique and interesting sounds to attract their customers. Everyone of them has a signature sound and everything is sold at a discount - the price of everything in there is usually cheaper.Just when you think you have seen it all, a blind man enters the coach singing a gospel song while playing his guitar in the background. He usually accompanied by someone holding a cup collecting donations on his behalf. No one tells the other that they are disturbing them. It's business as usual - all fighting for the attention of fellow passengers.Before you get off at your destination, you'll have seen it all.A Metrorail ride is like family - it is full of joy, wonders, sorrow and fantasy.&nbsp;As an African child, share your story or what you like most about living in Africa.Happy Africa Day Mzansi
