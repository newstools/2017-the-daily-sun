THE AREA around the Khuthuza and Madala hostels in Thokoza, Ekurhuleni is well-known for terrible deeds. But the horror has moved to another level. The police found the severed head of a two-month-old baby there. Yesterday, cops got a tip-off that chopped up body parts had been found in Khuthuza Hostel.The parts were taken away by forensic officers but when cops on the scene questioned residents, they were led to the open area linking the two hostels. Here the gruesome discovery of the baby&rsquo;s head, lying on a bed of cold gravel, was made.According to a resident, there has always been talk of body parts being sold in the area.&ldquo;I thought it was just gossip, but today I have seen it with my own eyes,&rdquo; said the shocked resident.&ldquo;The people doing such evil things must be dealt with. How can anybody kill an innocent child and sell its parts for muthi?&rdquo; The baby is believed to be about two months old and the parents have not been located.Police spokeswoman Captain Mbuyisile Mavela said they got a tip-off from a resident at the hostel about the body parts.&ldquo;When our members got to the hostel, they were taken to where they were spotted.&ldquo;The parts were separated from one another. &ldquo;We found the head between the Madala and Khuthuza hostels and we were taken to another location inside the hostel where we found the lower part, chopped into pieces,&rdquo; said Mavela.&ldquo;Investigations are underway to determine what happened to the baby and to confirm its identity.&rdquo;Mavela said they haven&rsquo;t made any arrests.&ldquo;But we are investigating and hope to make arrests very soon,&rdquo; she said.Mavela urged the public to come forward and assist with information.&ldquo;If there is anyone who has information on what might have happened to the baby, they must please call the detectives department on (011) 906 8600. Anyone can give information and will remain anonymous.&rdquo; Sangoma Mathabo Mofokeng said real sangomas don&rsquo;t use body parts for muthi.&ldquo;These are fake sangomas who wear beads and are good at creating muthi from human parts for bad intentions.&ldquo;Usually the muthi made from human parts is for business people who want to be feared and to get more people coming to their businesses.&ldquo;There is no specific body part used for a specific reason. Muthi is created depending on what it is needed for.&rdquo;
