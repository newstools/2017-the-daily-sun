THE MEC for transport and community safety in Limpopo, Nandi Ndalane, has welcomed the drop recently in the number of accidents and deaths.But she is concerned by the attitude and behaviour of road users. Over the past long weekend, 33 people lost their lives. In the same period last year, 48 lives were lost. This year, 73 accidents were recorded, compared to last year&rsquo;s 77 accidents.Ndalane said: &ldquo;We warmly welcome this reduction. We shall build on this reduction and ensure that we further improve on it in our quest to rid our roads of carnage.&rdquo; While this reduction is a welcome achievement, the department remains concerned about the attitude and behaviour of road users. Accidents this weekend consisted mainly of drivers losing control of their vehicles, which then overturned. Other factors included reckless and negligent driving, pedestrians on the roads, drunk driving, unsafe overtaking and speeding. All these factors were due to human behaviour and could be corrected. Meanwhile, as many people were travelling from their homes to their destinations on Monday, seven people died in two different accidents.Ndalane is worried about the behaviour of some road users, which results in deadly crashes. &ldquo;I have full confidence that road carnage can be beaten, only if we change our behaviour and attitude and obey all the rules of the road,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We shall continue to enforce the law and improve on our road safety awareness and education campaigns.&rdquo; The MEC advised the people of Limpopo to make road safety their primary responsibility. She said the department will continue to improve its resources and work harder to enforce the law.
