PROTESTS were the order of the day in some parts of Gauteng yesterday. Residents of Makawusi squatter camp in Germiston, Ekurhuleni, took to the streets claiming they are tired of being treated &ldquo;like ghosts&rdquo;.They claim they have been in the area since 1995 but have not received any services.&ldquo;We are only recognised during campaigns for votes,&rdquo; said Jomo Ngwenya, a community leader.&ldquo;Our yards will start sinking because we have dug holes to make toilets. We live like animals.&rdquo;An angry Fostina Shabalala said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve given up on the idea of getting RDPs. We welcomed the idea of the site and service strategy so that we can build our own homes, but nothing has happened.&ldquo;They promised to re-block us to make way for roads, but that never happened. Ambulances can&rsquo;t even drive in because it&rsquo;s too crowded.&rdquo; Meanwhile, in Geluksdal near Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, protesters complained about an increase in crime in the area due to a lack of police presence. Marriam Moipone (46) said they have no choice but to take the law into their own hands. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost trust in cops as people are robbed on a daily basis. The sad thing is that if a suspect is arrested today, he is back on the street the next day. &ldquo;Electricity is also a big problem here. It goes off every time and our food rots in the fridge. Izinyoka don&rsquo;t help the situation as they constantly steal cables.&rdquo; Also in Diepkloof, Soweto residents held a protest over service delivery.They barricaded the streets with burning tyres and trees. &ldquo;We see other communities developing every day, but we are sidelined,&rdquo; said community leader Noluthando Sigasa.She said there were about 3 000 RDPs built in Motsoaledi, not far from where they live.&ldquo;We hear nothing about us. None of us will be allocated a house there.&rdquo; The residents said they will protest every day until they are heard.
