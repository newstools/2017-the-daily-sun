INTERNATIONAL house music sensation Black Coffee is allegedly set to lure King Kotini to his stable!&nbsp; This comes after Riky&rsquo;s infamous rant at the Metro FM Music Awards in February.&nbsp; Rappers close to the pair say they have been working hand-in-hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;After Riky&rsquo;s fallout at the Metros, he was left in an ocean by himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black Coffee was the only respected musician who reached out to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even after he lost his house and car, Black Coffee managed to help get him back on his feet, by giving Riky moral support,&rdquo; said a showbiz insider.&nbsp; Another source said: &ldquo;Evidence that Black Coffee wants Riky to be in his stable began showing during his birthday celebration in Taboo around March.&rdquo;&nbsp; A third source said: &ldquo;Riky Rick will be Soulistic&rsquo;s newst hip hop artist. But the problem is that they still need to meet up and discuss the paper work, as Riky is independent and does most things alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;He sees Black Coffee as a big brother &ndash; who came into his life when things were about to get worse.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fourth source said: &ldquo;If DJ Oskido can back Cassper Nyovest in everything that he does, then Black Coffee can do the same. These people are all about growth, not personal wealth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sunday Sun has learnt that last week during the Major League birthday celebration, Riky and Black Coffee dined before entertaining a crowd at Harem/Kong in Rosebank.&nbsp; Two weeks ago, the same pair performed at a Block Party in Durban&rsquo;s Kings Park Stadium.&nbsp; Both Riky Rick and Black Coffee could not be reached for comment.&nbsp; They also failed to respond to our emails and SMSes at the time of going to press.&nbsp;
