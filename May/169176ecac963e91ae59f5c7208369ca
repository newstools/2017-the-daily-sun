THE Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital roof collapse was caused by overloading of crushed stone.Gauteng Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo says the crushed stone was to be removed from the roof, unfortunately it was stored on the roof and led&nbsp; to the extreme load that caused the collapse.On March 2, 2017, five people sustained minor injuries when parts of the roof near the hospital's main entrance collapsed.Workers from a privately-owned company were repairing a leaking section of the roof at the time.Mamabolo said the contractor should have known that the particular weight could not be carried by the structure.&nbsp;According to Mamabolo it was their responsibility to execute the project safely without damaging the property.Mamabolo said those responsible for the collapse would be held responsible.He said the incident had led the department into reviewing how it appoints contractors.He received a report from specialist attorneys Adams &amp; Adams on April 4. According to the infrastructure department's website, the Gauteng government planned to spend R42bn on socio-economic infrastructure programmes in the next three years.Shortly after the collapse, two anonymous sources said another section of the hospital, a dental clinic run by the University of the Witwatersrand, had been cordoned off because part of its ceiling, which collapsed in January, had still not been repaired.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/chalotte-maxeke-roof-collapse-caused-by-negligent-rubble-overload-mec-20170531
