SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini skipped another Parliamentary committee meeting today - the second time this week.Dlamini's department was due to present its annual strategic and budget plans to the portfolio committee on social development ahead of Parliament's budget votes later this month.The committee's secretary told MPs that Dlamini and deputy minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu had sent apologies, as they were attending a Cabinet meeting instead.Other ministers and deputies though, like Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande, were present in Parliament to present to their respective portfolio committees, News24 can confirm.DA MP Evelyn Wilson said the meeting was crucial, and that their meetings keep clashing with Cabinet meetings. They had not seen the deputy minister in over a year.IFP MP Liesl van der Merwe said the annual performance plan was signed off by the minister, the deputy and former director general Zane Dangor, none of whom were there to account.She said the public had been very scathing of their committee in keeping the executive to account during the social grants saga.ANC MP Sibongile Tsoleli said a deputy minister does not attend Cabinet meetings, so a further explanation was needed from Bogopane-Zulu.The committee, however, received notification last term that acting director general Nelisiwe Vilakazi, who was present, would replace Dangor, she said.On Tuesday, Parliament's select committee on social services cancelled its meeting on the department's upcoming budget vote after both Dlamini and Bogopane-Zulu failed to attend as well.The select committee is represented by MPs from the National Council of Provinces, as opposed to the National Assembly.Dlamini was also attending a meeting in Pretoria, the committee heard. She had not specified the nature of the meeting.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dlamini-skips-second-parliament-committee-meeting-this-week-20170503
