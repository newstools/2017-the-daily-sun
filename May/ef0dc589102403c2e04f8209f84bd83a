RESIDENTS of Fourteen Days Hostel at E section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, want privacy. The residents complain that four families are made to share a four-roomed block. &ldquo;We have different cultures but we cannot practise our culture in the presence of other families,&rdquo; said Albert Ntombela.Ntombela (61), a resident at the hostel, said things were better when women were visitors.&ldquo;Men were allowed to stay in the hostel&rsquo;s section A, where no women were allowed. &ldquo;If a wife was to visit her husband who lived at the hostel, she would be allowed to stay for up to 14 days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Her husband would come and visit her at night. That is why it is known as Fourteen Days. And men would be able to poke their wives without being scared of being heard by others.&rdquo; He said the system changed in the late 1990s. &ldquo;Women started to come here with children and their husbands left the men&rsquo;s hostel to live with them.&rdquo; Another resident, Themba Mkhize (54), said they have spoken to previous councillors about the issue of privacy.&ldquo;We have also spoken to the current councillor, Lindiwe Ncayiyana, who has promised to look into the matter.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either they build more rooms or take the system back to where it was before,&rdquo; he said.Ncayiyana confirmed that residents have raised the issue about the lack of privacy at the hostel with her.&ldquo;I only became a councillor last year. This issue needs time and a lot of engagement with everyone involved,&rdquo; said Ncayiyana.
