MADALA Phillimon Williams (77) is not only friends with dogs, but also eats with them. This is not because he prepares a meal for them. It&rsquo;s because they dig in rubbish bins together for food.Phillimon claimed his son Joseph Sehole (24) took both his ID and Sassa cards.He said he remembers the day he saw him walking out of his shack with the documents. He asked his son why he was taking them but Joseph apparently told him to shut up or he would beat him. The madala, who lives with his son and his son&rsquo;s girlfriend in extension 15, Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said he just kept quiet because he was afraid. He said the next day he went to the Mamelodi East Police Station but the cops allegedly told him to apply for a new ID. &ldquo;A woman cop told me to be a man and reduce the queue by going to apply for a new ID. I could not believe it,&rdquo; he said. Then he went to Home Affairs. &ldquo;The officials told me that their machines could not read my fingerprints and gave me a letter to go to their head office but I don&rsquo;t have money for transport. &ldquo;Now I live like a tenant in my own yard and I suspect he is withdrawing money with my Sassa card. &ldquo;I have been begging since January and I think people are tired of me asking for money.&rdquo; When Daily Sun visited Phillimon at his home, Joseph inquired why the SunTeam was there. &ldquo;He must have misplaced his cards in his shack. Don&rsquo;t believe everything he tells you,&rdquo; he said. Mamelodi East police spokesman, Captain Michael Mbewe, promised to investigate. &ldquo;Usually elderly people are prioritised so it&rsquo;s strange that he was turned away. We will visit him at his home.&rdquo;
