RUMOURED down-and-out musician Ishmael Morabe was allegedly bothering guests in Pata Pata at Maboneng, &ldquo;asking them for taxi money&rdquo;.&nbsp;The Roba Le Teka hitmaker, who was part of the 999 music label, was seen on the streets of Maboneng last Friday night.&nbsp;Sources close to the singer say he&rsquo;s having a tough time, and his musical career is fading.&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t have left Ghetto Ruff, he should&rsquo;ve just let Lance groom him to work behind the scenes,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;But now he&rsquo;s pestering people for transport money and food, and you can see he looks very frail.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in the music scene for more than 20 years, but has nothing to show for it.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;He pretended that he was special, but we could see that this man was really troubled.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true; when days are dark, friends are few. He is now rolling solo, no bling and no money &ndash;&ensp;just him and his humbled reality. It&rsquo;s so sad.&rdquo;Said a third source: &ldquo;Ishmael must just look for a nine-to-five job and make things easy for himself.&nbsp;&ldquo;Because with his current situation, he won&rsquo;t cut it. His music has gone down the drain.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a miracle if he bounces back with a banger. He should just do jazz music to get a source of income.&rdquo;Last month, Sunday Sun reported that King Of Kwaito Arthur Mafokate had called it a quits in the music industry as he shut down his 999 music label and gave artists their clearances.&nbsp;Ismael could not be reached for comment and failed to respond to SMSes.
