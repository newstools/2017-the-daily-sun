BEFORE reports of coach Stuart Baxter and Bafana Bafana coaching post starting gaining momentum SuperSport United seemed to be on course to win their fourth title. But Matsatsantsa a Pitori will now look back at Baxter and Safa&rsquo;s negotiations as the main reason why their team&rsquo;s title charge fell apart. The saga started on April Fool&rsquo;s Day with a 1-0 defeat against Baroka FC followed by back-to-back Tshwane derby defeats by Mamelodi Sundowns.SuperSport have since won just one game in their past six matches resulting in their title aspiration taking a huge fall. The rumours that broke out just before kick-off that coach Baxter was in charge of the dugout for the last time before being unveiled as the new Bafana coach this week, did little to lift the mood of his team. Boring! That&rsquo;s the best word that can be used to sum up SuperSport and Bloemfontein Celtic&rsquo;s dull goalless draw. Their Absa Premiership encounter at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atterdigeville last night was an uninspiring game that left the small contingent of fans that graced the occasion struggling to stay awake. Coach Stuart Baxter made his return to the side lines after missing two league games against Chiefs and Bidvest Wits due to illness. Celtic looked happy to hold to a priceless point even though a point did little to ease their relegation worries, while SperSport did not show enough hunger to win the game. Chances were far and few between. Celtic are 12th four points above safety on 26 points from 26 games, while Matsatsantsa are now officially out of the running in the title race as they are fifth with 42 points from 26 games trailing leaders Bidvest Wits by nine points.
