THEMBISILE Ntaka is 52 years old and a proud virgin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even at my age, I still go to Umkhosi woMhlanga,&rdquo; said Thembisile at a social cohesion dialogue about virginity. It was organised by eThekwini Municipality at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Tuesday night.&nbsp; &ldquo;I began this journey when I was 14 years old. I get a lot of people criticising me for being a virgin and not having children. Some even tell me I will die a lonely woman. But that does not make me want to change my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thembisile said she has never slept with a man or even kissed one. She said she is one of the most respected women in Botha&rsquo;s Hill. Thembisile encouraged young women to stay virgins.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the lastborn at home. My eight siblings got married and left me with my brother&rsquo;s two children.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said when she was young she heard her brothers&rsquo; friends saying bad things about the girls they&rsquo;d had sex with. &ldquo;I decided then I didn&rsquo;t want to be one of those girls,&rdquo; she said. She said each time there is virginity testing in her area, she is always the first one in line. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I die without children or a husband. I&rsquo;m happy with my life and so is my family.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the conference, where virgins and virginity testers discussed the importance of purity, tester Zanele Shezi-Sishi said it&rsquo;s important for women to look after themselves. &ldquo;Staying a virgin helps to avoid infections and disease.&rdquo; Head of recreation at eThekwini Municipality, Thembinkosi Ngcobo, said they chose the topic because too many girls fall pregnant at an early age.
