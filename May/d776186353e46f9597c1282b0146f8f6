POTHOLES are a cause for frustration among motorists in the city as they can cause severe damage to a vehicle such as tyre punctures, broken wheels and the suspension.But there is hope...The Johannesburg Road Agency has launched a new mobile app called JRA Find &amp; Fix to fight potholes.The new App will allow residents of the city to report potholes, missing manhole covers and out of order traffic signals.City of Johannesburg mayor, Herman Mashaba recently presented his plans to improve the city&rsquo;s pothole problem by allocating R88-million to deal with the pothole repair across the city.The roads in the deserted areas are generally in a worse condition compared to the highways, therefore the driver faces a bigger risk of hitting a pothole in those areas leaving them stranded in a dangerous area. According to Chief executive officer of Europ Assistance South Africa Christelle Colman it is increasingly difficult to spot a pothole when travelling at night."However it is worrying that the Johannesburg Roads Agency recently announced that it will need R1.38-billion per year for the next decade to be able to repair all the roads in the province. Due to the lack of maintenance 48% of the roads in the area are classified as being in poor or very poor condition." said Colman.Colman also said it is important that drivers have their dedicated emergency number saved on their phone, as many insurers insist that the policyholder only deal with a specified emergency assistance provider in order for a policy benefit to pay out.http://www.wheels24.co.za/News/joburgs-r88-million-plan-to-fix-its-pothole-problem-20170509
