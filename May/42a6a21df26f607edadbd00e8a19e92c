No one cares about us, said Martha.&ldquo;There is plenty of land in Ennerdale to build houses.&rdquo;The community threatened to burn down a house belonging to a councillor they accuse of not being supportive of their actions. &ldquo;We elected him. He must be with us all the way, even when days are dark,&rdquo; said Martha.Valerie Moses (48), secretary of the Ennerdale Stakeholders Association, told Daily Sun that over 10 000 people had no houses. &ldquo;People are voting but there is no service delivery,&rdquo; she said.Gauteng Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza told the People&rsquo;s Paper that &ldquo;the department remains committed to finding a lasting solution to the problems highlighted by the protesters&rdquo;. &ldquo;Currently, we&rsquo;re involved with the City of Joburg in identifying projects that will benefit those who qualify,&rdquo; said Khoza.
