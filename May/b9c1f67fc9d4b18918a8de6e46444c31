They want to use any opportunity to make money.&rdquo; A mother of two said she is worried that some of the live wires are exposed.&ldquo;People who come home when it&rsquo;s dark might step on the cables and get shocked to death,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Some wires are also hanging from buildings. This is very dangerous.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Lindela Mashigo said: &ldquo;We are aware of the power supply challenges experienced by block H residents. &ldquo;This can be blamed on the people who connect electricity illegally in the area. &ldquo;We have identified them and together with the police and other law enforcement authorities we will conduct an operation.&ldquo;The culprits will be arrested and heavily fined.&rdquo;
