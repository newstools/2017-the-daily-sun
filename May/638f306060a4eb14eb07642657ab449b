RESIDENTS said they voted as free South Africans in 1994, fervently believing promises that change would come.But while others around the old Kei Road kasi near King William&rsquo;s Town in the Eastern Cape tasted the fruit of freedom, they have nothing.Yesterday, the community rose in protest, closing roads with stones and rocks. Passing vehicles were stoned by angry residents demanding service delivery. Police arrived in the area and the residents dispersed.Residents told Daily Sun service delivery was almost non-existent in their area. &ldquo;There are many squatter camps that were established after this township. Those squatter camps are townships now with proper houses, water, sanitation and electricity,&rdquo; said one resident.Another told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Our grandparents were born here, living in these bad conditions. &ldquo;Government promised in 1996 to build RDP houses for the people of this area. We&rsquo;ve been waiting for many years. &ldquo;To our surprise construction recently began, but only in a neighbouring area that was established in recent years. &ldquo;What about us? We decided to toyi-toyi to show government that we&rsquo;re not happy at all. &ldquo;I still live at home with my gogo and parents &ndash; and bear in mind I am a married man. Where is the dignity in that situation?&rdquo; Councillor Xola Nqatha told Daily Sun the mayor of Amahlathi will set up a meeting with residents of Kei Road to listen to their grievances.
