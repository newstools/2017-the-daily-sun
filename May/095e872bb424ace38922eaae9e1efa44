THEY are dead and buried but they still get big government tenders.About 12 000 South African dead people have companies registered in their names, which are still very active and get government contracts. The South African National Treasury discovered this information in its register of companies that do business with the state.It was found that people set up companies with fake documents or the identities of dead citizens. They then use these businesses to tender for a project at higher prices, making their legitimate businesses seem as if they&rsquo;re pitching for the same work at cheaper rates. Head of the National Treasury's procurement office&nbsp;Schalk Human said that they make it&nbsp;look like there is competition but it&rsquo;s the same guy pitching. This is among some of &nbsp;the outcomes of a clean-up of the information system that the Treasury&rsquo;s procurement office undertook as the government battles to rein in spending, said Schalk Human, the unit&rsquo;s acting head. It has also identified about 14 000 state employees who are listed as directors of companies that have been awarded state contracts in violation of regulations.&ldquo;We will report on them even if we drag those 14 000 to court by their hair and lock them up,&rdquo; Human said in an interview this month in Pretoria.Fighting graft and achieving savings have become even more necessary since two ratings companies downgraded the debt of Africa&rsquo;s most-industrialised nation to junk. Fraud and inflated prices from suppliers consume as much as 40% of the state&rsquo;s R600bn budget for goods and services, Human&rsquo;s predecessor, Kenneth Brown, said last year.http://www.fin24.com/Economy/the-dead-are-bidding-for-government-business-in-sa-20170523
