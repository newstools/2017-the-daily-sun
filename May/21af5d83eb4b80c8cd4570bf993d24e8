THE WORK caretaker coach Fadlu Davids has been putting in at Maritzburg United is paying off. Davids was named the Absa Premiership Coach of the Month for April at the PSL offices in Parktown, Joburg, yesterday. Mamelodi Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango was named Player of the Month, while Mxolisi Kunene&rsquo;s goal against Kaizer Chiefs for the struggling Baroka FC was voted Goal of the Month. The Team of Choice are on the verge of securing a top eight berth after escaping relegation last season. Although Davids won&rsquo;t comment about taking the reins on a permanent basis, his players seem to respond well to his methods and he brings the team the desired results. Said Davids: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me, it&rsquo;s the players. I am just continuing where Roger (de Sa) left off, on the foundation Ernst (Middendorp) had set. He set the foundation after revamping the squad last season, put structures in place. It&rsquo;s not about me.&rdquo;After their 1-0 loss to Bidvest Wits at the weekend, Davids will be looking to steer his charges back to victory when they face Platinum Stars at the Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm). He said they would have to do well in all their remaining matches, as Stars, Orlando Pirates, Golden Arrows and Ajax Cape Town are all fighting to get into the top eight.He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be tough in the three games left. We have two home games and Sundowns in-between. &ldquo;There are four teams in it, we will have to take it game by game. All our focus now is on Platinum Stars. We have to press the reset button and analyse, correct and tackle the game with a fresh approach. &ldquo;As it is a home game we will try our best to get maximum points.&rdquo;
