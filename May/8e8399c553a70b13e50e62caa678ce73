The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) is back in court this morning in a bid to overturn the court interdict obtained last last week forcing the employees to return to work. Cabin crew members affiliated to SACCA were demonstrating at the SAA at OR Tambo International Airport last week, demanding the airline provide better working conditions and an increase in their international meal allowance from R17521 per day to R2272. SACCA is hoping for a meeting with SAA's chairwoman Dudu Myeni today, in an attempt to resolve their grievances.While negotiations are underway regarding meal allowances for cabin crew, the airline has stated that their "doing everything possible to find common ground and a settlement on matters"&nbsp;Kanti this SAA strike is about food allowance not salary increment? These people have really made it in life. #SAAstrike&mdash; Eldesign (@eldidiero) April 27, 2017#SAAstrike It is known that SAA crew pocket their $$$ cash allowance to take home. The crew hotels provide meals at reasonable prices.&mdash; Simon Grindrod (@SimonPGrindrod) April 26, 2017
