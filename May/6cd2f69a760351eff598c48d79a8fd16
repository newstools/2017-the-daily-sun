UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says his party&rsquo;s coalition with the DA is holding up in Nelson Mandela Bay. Holomisa said this in response to comments by the mayor, Athol Trollip, that the UDM had pulled out of the coalition. At a media briefing on Tuesday night Trollip said he had been told that Holomisa had informed DA leader Mmusi Maimane of the UDM&rsquo;s withdrawal. Holomisa yesterday denied this and said a national meeting with all coalition partners needed to be held to discuss the way forward. Trollip and UDM deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani have been at odds over a number of issues. Last month Bobani opened fraud cases against city manager Johann Mettler and acting executive director of corporate services Vuyo Zitumane. Trollip on Tuesday announced that Bobani had been fired as a mayoral health committee member. He remains deputy mayor, however, as he was elected to the position by a full council and can be removed only by the same council. Trollip said: &ldquo;I have attempted on numerous occasions to address councillor Bobani&rsquo;s conduct through the UDM&rsquo;s national leadership. &ldquo;He has gone too far with his continued defamatory remarks and bogus public statements and he recently laid criminal charges against senior executive administrators. &ldquo;Bobani has been at odds with the coalition partners since the coalition was formed in August, causing a strained relationship with the local government. My intention is to ensure this government is able to deliver better services, stop corruption and grow the economy to create jobs. &ldquo; Bobani has done everything to prevent this from happening.&rdquo; Trollip said he had written to Holomisa asking the UDM to nominate replacements for Bobani, but he had not received a response.
