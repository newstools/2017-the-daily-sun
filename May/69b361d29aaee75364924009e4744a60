IT WAS free beers for everyone!A South African Breweries truck lost its load of beer on the N12 near Avalon Cemetery in Soweto yesterday morning. Looters, including schoolgoing kids, had a field day as they sorted through the spilled drinks to salvage whatever they could find. Motorists joined in and started to load their cars with the bottles of liquor.No one seemed bothered by the driver, who had suffered minor injuries.People were seen freely boozing and dancing in full public view on the busy freeway, adding to a stampede which could easily have led to another accident. &ldquo;I am having a great time. There is no use going to school now. Let me first deal with the hangover,&rdquo; said a grade 8 pupil from a school in Chiawelo.Some motorists stopped and asked the pupils: &ldquo;Why are you here, aren&rsquo;t you supposed to be at school?&rdquo; A pupil said: &ldquo;We are helping ourselves to free stuff. It&rsquo;s our good luck.&rdquo;Another added: &ldquo;Why are you not at work, drinking tea?&rdquo; JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar was shocked to learn from the SunTeam that schoolkids had helped themselves to the booze.&ldquo;Really, schoolkids?&rdquo; asked a stunned Minnaar.&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand that this is not luck but a criminal offence. &ldquo;I will investigate the details of this incident,&rdquo; he said.
