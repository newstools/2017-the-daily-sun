SPEAKERS STOOD up to celebrate Karabo&rsquo;s short life . . . and to condemn&thinsp;her&thinsp;terrible death.&nbsp;And everybody listened with tears in their eyes to the words written in her broken-hearted&thinsp;mother&rsquo;s&nbsp;letter.&nbsp; YOU&rsquo;LL ALWAYS BE IN MY HEART, MY ANGEL.&thinsp;REST&thinsp;IN PEACE, MY BEAUTIFUL ANGEL.&nbsp;There were tears, joy and laughter as friends and family paid tribute to murdered Karabo Mokoena at the memorial service held at the packed Diepkloof Multi-Purpose Centre Hall in Soweto.&nbsp; Since the life being celebrated was that of a young woman, the youths were given a chance to share their memories with the guests.&nbsp; Karabo&rsquo;s friend, Neo Mohlabane, spoke about the last moments she spent with Karabo.&nbsp; She said they were at a restaurant in Sandton. &ldquo;I knew what had happened to my friend,&rdquo; said Neo. &ldquo;There were only a few bruises and scratches left, but overall she had recovered.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said Karabo told her she was living testimony that there is a God. &ldquo;Look at me now. I&rsquo;m still standing.&rdquo; Neo described Karabo as a strong and bold person who had a vulnerable side that she didn&rsquo;t show easily. &ldquo;She told me everything may look perfect on the outside, but she was scared inside.&nbsp; &ldquo;She said her ex had hurt her, and she was still hurting.&rdquo; She said she asked her friend to go for counselling.&nbsp; One speaker read out a letter from Karabo&rsquo;s mum, Lolo Mokoena.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so looking forward to all the beautiful things,&rdquo; read Lolo&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;I will miss you making fun of me. You&rsquo;ll always be in my heart, my angel. Rest in peace, my beautiful angel.&rdquo; Karabo&rsquo;s cousin, Boipelo Mokoena, who described her as a beautiful queen, said: &ldquo;Karabo lived her life. She was young, she travelled, she lived her life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said it happened so fast. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s the thing about life. We don&rsquo;t know when we are going to go.&rdquo; Dr Adele Tjale of Wholeness Life Care Centre said killing women was no longer an unusual occurrence and said men were not doing anything about the issue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are the fathers?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Women, men have failed to lead, the fathers of this nation have failed to protect the girl child. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some of the prominent faces seen at the memorial were Rivonia trialist Andrew Mlangeni, Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and veteran actor Patrick Shai.&nbsp;
