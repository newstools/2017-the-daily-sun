&ldquo;IF THIS is a trend, it must stop now,&rdquo; said angry Mofolo North community leader Simon Mtshali (45). He was speaking to Daily Sun at another horrific scene in Soweto, where the body of a woman burned beyond recognition had been found. No one could tell who she was. People think she was killed and burned somewhere else before her body was thrown onto the Mofolo dump site. A recycler made the gruesome discovery yesterday morning. &ldquo;I saw a green sail and thought I&rsquo;d hit the jackpot. When I opened it I could not believe my eyes. I immediately called people and we called the cops,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, residents of Naledi Extension yesterday woke up to the discovery of another dead woman. She was stoned to death, and had a pile of stones stacked around her resembling a tomb. According to community leader Emmanuel Mother, this is the third body of a woman found within three days.&ldquo;This comes a day after another woman was found dead in this area. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been reporting cases to the police, but it does not seem as if crime is decreasing,&rdquo; he said, warning that as cops fail them people will take the law into their own hands. Mahlatse Manamela (24) was cutting grass with his friend when they discovered the body. &ldquo;My friend called me to come see a body of a woman with bricks covering her.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen such cruelty to a fellow human being. I want the new police minister to come and visit Soweto and see what we go through here.&rdquo; Captain Mpande Khoza said they are investigating a case of murder. &ldquo;We appeal to anyone or families whose loved ones are missing to come to the Diepkloof Mortuary to check if this is not one of their family members.&rdquo; Khoza also appealed to people to help with any information that might lead to the arrest of those responsible.
