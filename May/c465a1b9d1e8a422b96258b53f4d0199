CHIPPA United coach Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela has hit the ground running after being recalled from &ldquo;special leave&rdquo; by his relegation-haunted club. Immediately after landing in Port Elizabeth yesterday, Malesela called a technical team meeting where they discussed Chippa&rsquo;s problems on the field, which saw them lose three matches in a row while he was on forced leave. They lost matches to fellow relegation strugglers Highlands Park (1-0), Ajax Cape Town (1-0) and Orlando Pirates (2-1).Malesela confirmed to SunSport yesterday that he has been recalled to retake the reins before their match against SuperSport United in the Premiership on Wednesday. They conclude the season against Free State Stars on 27 May.They face SuperSport United again this weekend in the Nedbank Cup semifinal at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Saturday.Malesela said he would try everything in his power to help the club retain their PSL status, &ldquo;even though it will not be easy&rdquo; considering their position in the league table.The Chilli Boys are 15th in the standings with 24 points from 28 matches, equal on points with bottom team Baroka FC with only goal difference separating the two.&ldquo;I have identified some of the weaknesses in the team and I am sure we can correct them if the players come to the party too,&rdquo; Malesela said.&ldquo;This technical team meeting is very important as we have to share ideas and ensure we implement them against SuperSport. It will not be an easy ride but working together, we can save this club.&rdquo;Malesela was placed on &ldquo;special leave&rdquo; by club boss Siviwe &ldquo;Chippa&rdquo; Mpengesi on 27 April after their 3-2 loss to Maritzburg United.But he received a letter on Friday ordering him to return to his club to continue with his responsibilities as Chippa head coach. Chippa need to win their remaining two league matches to stay in the PSL and have to rely on Highlands and Baroka&rsquo;s results. Failure to collect the six points could be detrimental and see them return to the National First Division (NFD) next season.Another option would be to negotiate their way back to the Premiership via the promotion/relegation play-offs should they finish 15th in the table and have to compete with the NFD teams finishing second and third. Chippa never fired Malesela &ndash; being put on special leave does not mean axing. He is still their employee.He reportedly would have been due a hefty R4 million out-of-court settlement had the club prematurely terminated his contract, which still has two years to run until 2019.
