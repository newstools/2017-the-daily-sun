LIMPOPO Baobabs coach Dumisani Chauke is delighted at the progress her charges are making in the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League this season. After finishing rock bottom last season without winning a single game, the Baobabs have gone three games unbeaten so far. They have beaten the Mpumalanga Sunbirds and the Northern Cape Diamonds and managed a draw against the KwaZulu-Natal Kingdom Stars. However, their next two matches against Gauteng&rsquo;s Golden Fireballs and last year&rsquo;s finalists, the Jaguars, will be the real tests for the vastly improved side when the tournament moves to Cape Town&rsquo;s Belhar Indoor Sports Centre this weekend. Chauke&rsquo;s side is now third in the league with five points.She said the hard work the players had put in had started paying off. &ldquo;It feels great. The players have been working hard since the camps we had before the league started. Their sacrifice is paying off. We are working hard as a unit.&rdquo;After three poor seasons, Chauke is hoping they will finish at least eighth this year, despite the fact that the Baobabs face the added challenge of not being able to train together all the time. The Baobabs players who are based in Gauteng train with Chauke&rsquo;s university team, while the others train together in Limpopo. She said: &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re training with my Tshwane University of Technology team, I communicate with the team in Limpopo so that we do the same thing and are on the same page when we step on court. &ldquo;At the beginning we were simply hoping for any hint of improvement &ndash; and they have shown that and more. It brought the positive results we are seeing now. We have set ourselves a target of eighth place but would be happier to end the season in seventh spot.&rdquo;Chauke believes there would be more exciting competition between the provinces if provincial governments partnered with universities, as some players migrate between them in search of better opportunities.
