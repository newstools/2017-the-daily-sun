UKHOZI FM programme manager Zandile Tembe&rsquo;s &ldquo;once dreamy&rdquo; marriage is allegedly on course for the rocks.&nbsp;According to insiders, the broadcaster has even separated from her businessman hubby, Sizwe Sifunda.&nbsp;A source claimed the couple&rsquo;s union was doomed from the moment Sizwe&rsquo;s property business took a nose dive.&nbsp;&ldquo;Things look bad. She has moved back to her home in Umlazi, KwaZulu-Natal,&rdquo; the first source said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zandile used to always post pictures on social media, flaunting the destinations the couple had visited.&nbsp;&ldquo;But that hasn&rsquo;t been the case recently. She&rsquo;s even stopped talking about her husband, whom she used to brag a lot about.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to the source, these were telling signs that there was trouble in paradise.&nbsp;The concerned source said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that a woman you married and promised to do everything for would simply just dump you when your business was experiencing a down cycle.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zandile loves a glitzy and glamorous life. So, I&rsquo;m not surprised by what is happening. She loves the status of being known as that awesome woman who has it all in life.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second source said Zandile had even stopped attending major events with her husband.&nbsp;Said the mole: &ldquo;Remember, they had to borrow money from Sma Mbatha at some point.&nbsp;&ldquo;Zandile felt embarrassed that she had to go to her junior for money, about R70 000, to help solve her family&rsquo;s financial crisis.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think that little saga really broke this sham of a marriage, based on money &ndash; and not love. It was always doomed to fail &ndash; for one reason or another.&rdquo;&nbsp;Both Zandile and Sizwe were not available for comment.&nbsp;
