STELLENBOSCH University today temporarily suspended three students linked to the planning of the "Anglo-Afrikaner Student" event at the university.The university said in a statement that the matter was investigated by the university's Equality Unit, which has made recommendations to its Central Disciplinary Committee and management.This comes after posters surfaced on the campus on Tuesday which appeared to be digitally created copies of Nazi-era Germany posters.The posters, with "the Anglo-Afrikaner student" written on them, called for students to "fight for Stellenbosch" and attend a meeting at the university's library today at 5pm.Security was asked to remove the posters."The CDC will in the course of handling this matter decide on the suspensions and further steps. The case is receiving priority attention. The disciplinary process should be allowed to run its course," Professor De Villiers said.The Equality Unit reported that the posters and advertised event promoted racial division and white supremacy together with highly offensive references to Nazi propaganda and Neo-Nazism.It was in breach of the varsity&rsquo;s policy on unfair discrimination and harassment."It found that the behaviour and actions of the students in question had a demeaning and humiliating impact, and created an intimidating environment at the university."De Villiers said the venue booking was not approved by the university and they did not have any information about the planned gathering before the posters were displayed without permission."We will continue to take a stand against racism and unfair discrimination, and promote human rights, equality, human dignity and democracy. This we do in accordance with our own policies, as well as our commitment to the Constitution of South Africa and the Bill of Rights that it enshrines," he said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/three-maties-suspended-for-nazi-inspired-posters-20170511
