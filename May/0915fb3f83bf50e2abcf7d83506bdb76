THE recall of President Jacob Zuma is not on the agenda of the National Executive Committee (NEC), according to ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe during a media briefing ahead of the body’s second day of the three-day gathering. There’s been speculation that the gathering – which took place without Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa due to the death of his nephew – would discuss whether Zuma needed to step down as head of state. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Said Mantashe: “We are reading it in newspapers that there’s going to be bloodshed. We haven’t seen that blood on the floor yet.” According to Mantashe, the NEC only dealt with soft issues on Friday – when many of the party’s executive was still on its way to the meeting from parliamentary commitments in Cape Town. “Today, we are in the hard business of the NEC.” Mantashe said several current issues would form part of the executive’s debates, adding there was a proposal for the next phase of the succession discussion to kick in. This amid calls from some, including the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng to open up the debate. The party will have to choose new leadership in December, when Zuma is expected to step down as the 105-year-old liberation movement’s president. A fierce battle between Ramaphosa and former African Union Commission chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, punted as the two main contenders, has dominated the party’s succession debate. “We’re not opening contestation, but going to phase two, not nomination, but allowing ANC structures to discuss and link the names to principles,” Mantashe said. – News24
