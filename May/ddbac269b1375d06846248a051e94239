A NUMBER of police cars went up in smoke after a raging veld fire swept through Welkom on Monday. According to police spokesman Brigadier Motantsi Makhele, the 37 cars were about to be scrapped anyway because they were old and battered and could no longer be repaired. Makhele said preliminary investigations revealed that the fire started at the rugby field situated near the SAPS camp in Welkom. &ldquo;The field is used as a pedestrian footpath. We suspect that a discarded cigarette butt caused the fire that broke out there,&rdquo; said Makhele. &ldquo;The fire moved rapidly due to the wind and the dry veld. &ldquo;It took firefighters more than an hour to put out the fire. &ldquo;The cars there were no longer being used as state vehicles.&rdquo; Free State provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Lebeoana Tsumane assured the community of Matjhabeng that service delivery would not be compromised as a result of the loss of the cars. &ldquo;I have appointed a team of experts, led by the deputy provincial commissioner of crime detection, Major-General Jones Qhobosheane, to investigate and determine the cause of the fire. &ldquo;We hope this will identify hazards and prevent future fires. &ldquo;The community should rest assured that normal policing services will not be affected at all,&rdquo; said Tsumane.
