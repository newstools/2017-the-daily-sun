THE brutal murder of a young woman last Wednesday has left her family and residents in shock.&nbsp; Lindiwe Sangweni (35) from section D6 in Mamelodi, Tshwane was stabbed so viciously in the stomach with a panga that her intestines came out of her body. She was also strangled, allegedly by her boyfriend.&nbsp; Her sister, Nomvula Khumalo, told Daily Sun the family was told of the incident by a neighbour who heard Lindiwe screaming.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said he heard Lindiwe screaming for help and went to knock on her door.&nbsp; &ldquo;When no one opened, he kicked the door open and saw Lindiwe lying on the floor,&rdquo; said Nomvula.&nbsp; The neighbour claimed her boyfriend then threw her intestines at him and ran away. She said the neighbour alerted the community and the police were called.&nbsp; The boyfriend apparently returned to the scene, where he cut open his wrists and sucked his own blood.&nbsp; &ldquo;When he saw the police, he fell to the ground and was arrested,&rdquo; said Nomvula.&nbsp; She said a friend of Lindiwe&rsquo;s told the family she had suffered terrible abuse at the hands of her boyfriend.&nbsp; &ldquo;She filed a protection order against him a few days before she was murdered. We didn&rsquo;t know anything about this until she died,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Mamelodi West police spokesman Captain Johannes Maheso said the suspect was arrested and charged with murder.&nbsp; &ldquo;He appeared in the Mamelodi West Magistrates Court on Friday and the case was postponed to Friday for a bail application.&rdquo;&nbsp; Maheso appealed to members of the community who might have seen or heard what happened to share any information with the police.
