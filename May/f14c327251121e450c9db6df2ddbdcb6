THE municipality allegedly dug a trench in the yard for centre staff to dispose of used nappies. But now it is full and the smell from the trench at Emmanuel Old Age Home in Clocolan, Free State is unbearable. According to centre officials, the municipality dug a trench for them to throw the nappies into.&ldquo;The municipality said it would close the trench but nothing has happened and the bad smell and flies have taken over our place,&rdquo; said manager Lisebo Selala. &ldquo;We use nappies for our old people. Beforehand, we could put the used nappies in plastic bags so they could be taken to the dump. The municipality used to pick them up in front of the centre but then they stopped. &ldquo;Early last year I then went to Setsoto Municipality to ask them to help us by removing our waste, especially the used nappies. &ldquo;Instead, officials said they would dig a trench inside the home&rsquo;s yard, about 100m from the building. &ldquo;The hole is full and no one intends to help us with it. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what to do with these nappies anymore and it is bad for the health of the people who live here. &ldquo;I kept on calling and making follow-ups, but nothing is happening.&ldquo;The smell is very bad for our elderly people and the flies go straight to our kitchen.&ldquo;I wonder why the municipality doesn&rsquo;t provide us with service. We really need it to keep the environment clean. The municipality is really failing our people,&rdquo; said Selala.Setsoto municipal spokeswoman Moroesi Gaba said: &ldquo;I have consulted the relevant division. &ldquo;No report was received from the complainant or the centre manager.&ldquo;But the municipality commits to attend to it by the end of this week.&rdquo;
