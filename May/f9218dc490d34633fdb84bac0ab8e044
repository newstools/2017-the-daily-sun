THE Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court heard on Friday that the Jesus Dominion International Church prophet Tim Om- otoso, who is seeking bail, is in SA illegally. Home Affairs immigration officer Ivan Klaasen was handed five passports belonging to Omotoso (58) by the defence team to investigate. He told the court that he had picked up from the system that Omotoso had used six passports since 2000.He said: &ldquo;One of the passports had a visa that entitles him to one entry into the country, but he used it three times and it was never scanned. &ldquo;The visa had no barcode authorities can refer to, which means that the extension and new work permit were fraudulent and this made him eligible for deportation.&rdquo;Omotoso faces 22 charges related to sexual offences and human trafficking. He is alleged to have sexually abused several young women at his church in Umhlanga , Durban, under the pretext of healing them.Two Eastern Cape MECs were among those at the court on Friday morning opposing bail. MEC for social development Nancy Sihlwayi said that &ldquo;Parliament has sent us here. &ldquo;We will follow the correct procedures as government on this matter.&rdquo; The bail hearing was postponed until 23 May and Omotoso will remain in prison at St Albans.
