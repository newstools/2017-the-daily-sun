I have given them my baptism certificate which shows I was baptised in 1941,” said Ziciki.He now has three ID books with the same date of birth. He said his twins are 43 years old and he had them when he was 34. “I’m supposed to be getting a pension grant but I can’t because of my ID situation. My family members have died. So besides my baptism certificate, I don’t have anything to prove my age. How can they ask me to bring my father’s ashes? I see that as an insult. I want them to sort out the problem and stop asking for things I can’t bring.” Muziwenhlanhla Mhlongo (76) said he went to Mqongqotho Primary School with John.“I’m shocked that now he is said to be 59 years old.” Thabo Mokgola, a Home Affairs spokesman, said the department is looking into the matter. “The provincial manager for Home Affairs in KZN will contact the client to resolve the matter,” said Mokgola.
