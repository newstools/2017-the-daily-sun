KZN police spokesman Thulani Zwane said while they were still in the house residents gathered outside. They allegedly attacked and overpowered the cop waiting in the van, before they entered the house. “They overpowered the other police officer and forcefully took the suspect.“They assaulted him with sticks, stones and bush knives before setting him alight. “He died at the scene due to his injuries,” said Zwane.He said a case of murder, assault and malicious damage to property had been opened at the Umlazi cop shop for further investigation. Zwane said Nguse was a suspect in a case where the decomposed body of Sandile Dladla (25) was found at E section squatter camp last week.“It is not known how Sandile died as we are still awaiting results of the post mortem,” said Zwane. KZN acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa condemned the actions of the community. “It is totally unacceptable that someone is killed merely because he was a suspect. “Cops were following the necessary route to establish if the dead man was guilty or innocent,” said Langa. He said even though there was sufficient evidence against the suspect, he was entitled to his day in court to defend himself. “We will ensure that those who attacked our officers and killed the suspect receive a fair trial, which is a right that the deceased was denied,” said Langa. Nguse’s family were not available for comment at the time of going to print.
