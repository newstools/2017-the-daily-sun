HIS journey to turn his life around began in prison, where he was serving a 10-year jail sentence for armed robbery in 2006. The 33-year-old from J section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, told Daily Sun he realised he would need to keep himself busy as he would spend a long time behind bars. &ldquo;I did a cooking course to become a chef and earned a certificate. I started cooking in the prison kitchen.&rdquo; He said he still wasn&rsquo;t fulfilled when he cooked as he felt there was something more he needed to do.&ldquo;I realised I loved nice clothes and asked warders to help me start sewing. I was given tools and I taught myself how to sew with a needle.&rdquo; He said at the time he was still working in the kitchen, cooking porridge for prisoners. He said when he was finished cooking he would start sewing. &ldquo;I started by sewing a jacket. I was so proud of myself when I finished it because no one taught me how to sew.&rdquo; He said a lot of prisoners liked his work. &ldquo;Even the warders would come to me if their uniforms needed any alteration. They would pay me for my work.&rdquo; He said with the money he made he was able to buy a sewing machine. &ldquo;I started sewing uniforms for the prison chefs.&rdquo;He said when he was released from prison last year, he decided to continue sewing.&ldquo;This is how I make a living now. If I hadn&rsquo;t been arrested I would not have realised my talent. Maybe I would have been killed.&rdquo; He said he has changed his life because while he was in prison he realised that crime does not pay.&ldquo;Being arrested makes you lose out on many things. I was not around when my father died or when my child was born.&rdquo;He said now he is working on becoming the best at what he does.
