A trolley man said the thugs regularly terrorise and rob women of their cellphones at knife point.&ldquo;I was pushing a trolley when I saw shoppers chasing three men. They had tried to rob a woman,&rdquo; said Amos Nongezi (45).&ldquo;When the shoppers caught them, they were beaten. One of the thugs was bleeding heavily after being injured on his head.&rdquo;A relieved victim said: &ldquo;I was outside the mall when the robbers suddenly appeared from nowhere and demanded my phone. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t resist because they held big knives to my chest and stomach.&rdquo; Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;Three suspects were arrested by a guard after they tried to rob a woman. &ldquo;They were handed over to the cops and charged with attempted robbery.&rdquo;
