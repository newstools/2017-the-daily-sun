JUST when you thought Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s confidence and morale was down to its lowest level after losing their Absa Premiership title, things just got more frustrating for the Caf Cha mpions League defending coach.&nbsp;Mosimane has a centre back nightmare as Brazilian Ricardo Nascimento, Ivorian Soumahoro Bangaly and Wayne Arendse have been out for months with an assortment of injuries.&thinsp;Nascimento has been ruled out of action for six months, something that has hit Mosimane by surprise and he&rsquo;ll have to make do without his trusted centre back.&ldquo;This is a big loss,&rdquo; Mosimane pointed out following their 2-2 draw against Maritzburg United, which dimmed their little hopes of winning the Premier Soccer League (PSL) again.Making matters worse for the Brazilians coach is that Bangaly picked up a knock in their 2-2 draw against Maritzburg United midweek and he&rsquo;ll be out for two weeks.His other centre back out of action for three months is Arendse, who will miss the remainder of the season and could be back in action in August for the new season.All the above players won&rsquo;t be around for Sundowns&rsquo; tough as teak Caf Champions League group match against AS Vita Club at the 50-seater Stade Tata-Raphael at capital Kinshasa on Wednesday.Now Mosimane will have to rely on ageing Thabo Nthethe and inexperienced Motjeka Madisha to stop the vicious DR Congolese strikers from scoring.The biggest loss for Mosimane, in the group of death that consists of Esp&eacute;rance of Tunisia, St George of Ethiopia, and DRC&rsquo;s AS Vita Club, is the injury of Nascimento.Nascimento joined Sundowns with a niggling groin injury and needs a major hip operation that will take six months to heal.The operation is scheduled in Brazil tomorrow and the earliest he could be back in action is in January next year.&ldquo;What do you do in this case?&rdquo; Mosimane asked.&ldquo;Nascimento came with a hip injury but it&rsquo;s getting worse now. Bangaly was limping against Maritzburg and I had to act fast to avoid exacerbating it.&ldquo;Look, I just wish that one of these players could recover quickly as people respond differently from injuries,&rdquo; Mosimane added.&ldquo;Losing the local league title is not a major factor for us but we will fight not to lose the Champions League title.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve played almost 58 matches in total, and I can&rsquo;t falter my players for showing signs of fatigue,&rdquo; he said.He has also confirmed what most people have been suspecting, that the 26-year-old Khama Billiat is no longer lethal like before, as he has already played 69 matches non-stop, including for his national team Zimbabwe.
