AFTER Fadlu Davids spoiled the Worker&rsquo;s Day afternoon for Eric Tinkler on Monday, the Maritzburg United caretaker coach is now making plans for the future.Their 1-0 win against title-chasing Cape Town City FC saw the seventh-placed PSL side close the gap between them and sixth placed Polokwane City to a mere two points.KwaZulu-Natal&rsquo;s Maritzburg have 35 points and are breathing down the necks of Limpopo outfit Rise and Shine.Davids, who took charge after Ernst Middendorp&rsquo;s departure, reckons 42 or 43 points will be enough to see them play in the MTN8 competition for the second time in club&rsquo;s history next season. Davids said with four games still to go, Farook Kadodia&rsquo;s club had a great chance of collecting all 12 points on offer. &ldquo;Even though the games will be difficult, I think we can reach our target,&rdquo; he said.Interestingly United will play a role in deciding the ultimate winners, as they are still to negotiate their way past title contenders Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns, as well as Platinum Stars and Bloemfontein Celtic. But Davids is convinced his charges are capable of achieving their target: &ldquo;It was not easy playing against Cape Town City, let alone beating them. My players really put up a great performance. Credit must go to all of them.&rdquo; Davids took a trip down memory lane, reflecting on what the team was facing at this stage last season. He added: &ldquo;This time last season we were rooted to the bottom of the table. This year we are talking about a top eight finish. The three points from Cape Town City also ensures we are safe from relegation.&rdquo;The Team of Choice&rsquo;s next match is against log leaders Wits at Bidvest Stadium on Sunday (3pm).
