ZUMA must go, Zuma must go!This was the resounding chant at Cosatu&rsquo;s Workers&rsquo; Day rally that drowned out the desperate attempts of leaders to resume control of the gathering.Members of Nehawu and NUM seemed to lead the disruption. Both unions, which are affiliates of Cosatu, have objected to President Jacob Zuma being allowed to address the rally.Cosatu itself is on record as calling for Zuma to step down as president. However, it said a decision had been made to allow Zuma to address the May Day rally because it had invited its alliance partner, the ANC, to attend its rally. It said it could not dictate to the ANC who they should send.The pro-Zuma faction soon found their voices and tried to drown out the anti-Zuma chants. There were also reports of fist fights breaking out. #WorkersDay Zuma arrives as his the pro-Zuma are take over, chanting:Zuma!
