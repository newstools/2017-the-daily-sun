YESTERDAY was a very momentous day for Bidvest Wits when they were officially handed their Absa Premiership trophy.&nbsp;Wits&rsquo; 1-0 loss against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium did not matter as the Students had clinched the league title with a game to spare two weeks ago. It was Wits&rsquo; first league title in 96 years and their coach Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s fourth championship medal.&nbsp;In the other part of Gauteng, Highland Park were relegated to the National First Division after their dramatic 2&ndash;2 draw against Mamelodi Sundowns. It was their first season in the paid ranks and they found the going very tough.Highlands&rsquo; honeymoon lasted for just one season and they will look to their chopping and changing of coaches as one of their biggest reasons why they have been relegated from the PSL.&nbsp;Their coaching merry-go round has now cost them an arm and a leg. One year after gaining promotion to the top flight division, the Lions of the North are heading straight back to the National First Division next season.&nbsp;Highlands&rsquo; loss will go into millions of rands due to the sugar-coated monthly grants in the PSL.&nbsp;And it&rsquo;s also official that Tembisa will no longer have any Premiership representative next season.&nbsp;Thousands of people in one of the biggest townships in the country came in their big numbers to support their team.&nbsp;They created an electric atmosphere cheering their team on, but their hearts were broken. Park brought football to Tembisa and seeing them going down broke a lot of people&rsquo;s hearts. Baroka FC gave themselves a lifeline in the form of the PSL/relegation play-off starting next week against NFD oppositions Black Leopards and Stellenbosch FC in a mini round robin league. Baroka stepped up to be counted as they played a game of their lives when they edged Ajax Cape Town 1-0 at the Cape Town Stadium.&nbsp;The Baroka win knocked Ajax out of the Top8 spot, allowing Golden Arrows, who defeated Orlando Pirates 2-1 in injury time, to sneak into the much-sought after MTN8 competition next season. It was surely a season to forget for Pirates.&nbsp;
