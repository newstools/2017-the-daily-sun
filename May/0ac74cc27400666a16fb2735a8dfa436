ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa blames all the problems and tensions within the alliance on state capture. Ramaphosa urged Cosatu’s Central Executive Committee meeting at St George’s Hotel in Irene, outside Tshwane yesterday to continue speaking out about the problems within the ANC.This is in contrast to President Jacob Zuma and his backers, who have come down hard on the federation for concerning itself with ANC matters.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstJTqI4pufWrEw1HPEiuyUEYG8hxlbDjpAwngbzLJMydK15dmuXRpoZGps9mWdid8vWclb-GcVa-V90DuZSXlsUV4fxIItKBIcmwnho4e3XQfimMcYjHwqOGJhEehcBDPSDMgZLBNayo6ssrkgpSXVHu7AENQcEWJfpPEwxpXezIXFa9ort-hPEgFeS-EZgn_O3aDIbCTt5Ot9lL7zM5ezOwtZntwSxt5EyeXnThlPalLzJja3LICTnR4ZMJgaw6AcRsZCmHV27IdwLqTQrgtw4GOKyplo\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFal0yewnQj1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They are about occupying the position of power and prestige. They are about corruption and state capture. We shouldn’t keep quiet about them because they are hurting. They are eating away at the ANC.” He urged the delegates to support the ANC NEC’s resolution for the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry, repeating calls that the commission be set up immediately.“This must happen and happen as quickly as possible. The workers are correct to be concerned about state capture,” said Ramaphosa.He explained that the commission was important because it could help people clear their names and put a lot of stories and rumours to rest.Ramaphosa said Cosatu should have been consulted about the recent Cabinet reshuffle. “The alliance is led by the ANC, we know that. But you are equal partners and must be consulted.” Ramaphosa, who has been endorsed by Cosatu to succeed Zuma, said as they prepared for the ANC elective conference in December, they should choose ethical leaders.He said: “Opposition parties are already sharpening their knives to campaign for the 2019 national elections.“We must elect leaders who will take us beyond 2019.”
