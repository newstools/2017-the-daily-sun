THE ANC said calls to recall President Jacob Zuma were an attempt to remove the party from power. Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe yesterday told journalists at Luthuli House in Joburg that opposition parties weren&rsquo;t after one person, but the ANC. &ldquo;The ANC shouldn&rsquo;t be fooled to think it is about one person. It is not.&rdquo; But he couldn&rsquo;t give a clear explanation why there had been calls for Zuma to leave from within the ANC, including from veterans and NEC members. He confirmed a motion for Zuma to step down was discussed at the party&rsquo;s NEC meeting over the weekend and said it was part of a broader discussion about calls for the president to resign. &ldquo;A number of NEC members were of the view that the ANC should listen to this call. Contributions in support of and against the appeal to the president to step down were raised.&rdquo; He said the party looked at the outcome of removing the president but found some of the calls, especially by the opposition, were about dislodging the ANC itself from power. About reappointing Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, he said Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown was told to reverse the decision before it was taken to court. He said succession nominations open in September. &ldquo;The NEC accepted the proposal tabled for a judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture without delay.&rdquo;
