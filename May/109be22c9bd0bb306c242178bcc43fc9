LUC Eymael has been banned from working for any other club in the PSL bar Polokwane City. The controversial 57-year-old coach was fined R100 000 by the league at a disciplinary committee (DC) hearing for misconduct on Tuesday &ndash; R75 000 of which has been suspended until 30 June.The Belgian coach had serious legal issues with Polokwane City chairman Johnny Mogaladi after he abruptly resigned from the club and three days later emerged at Bloemfontein Celtic.The issue was escalated to the PSL after Eymael stood his ground and refused to go back to the northern province.His stay at Celtic has not been a rosy one, as he was not allowed to coach the team until he had appeared before the league&rsquo;s DC.The PSL DC ruled in favour of Rise and Shine and ordered Eymael to return to Limpopo to honour his contract with Mogaladi&rsquo;s club.But the stubborn coach declined, until he was called to another DC on Tuesday, where he was slapped with a fine and ordered again to return to the Limpopo club.Eymael, who was apparently kicked out by Celtic at the weekend and dumped at the airport, refused to talk to SunSport yesterday when questions were posed to him.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk to journalists, please leave me alone,&rdquo; Eymael said, sounding frustrated after learning his appeal with Safa had failed.Our informant who is privy to such information told SunSport that Celtic were gatvol of Eymael and would like to continue with Lehlohonolo Seema as their coach. They had apparently completely cut ties with Eymael.Said the source: &ldquo;I am also told Luc and Seema clashed at the weekend when he wanted to tell him how to coach. Seema stood his ground and told Luc to keep quiet, as he was the coach in charge. This infuriated Luc, who exchanged hard words with Seema before players intervened.&ldquo;I understand Luc also called the Polokwane City chairman, asked for forgiveness and pleaded with him to be allowed back. He was trying to negotiate his way back after realising pride wouldn&rsquo;t pay his bills. &ldquo;Look at Dan Malesela, he peacefully returned to Chippa United without hesitation.&rdquo;It is unclear what his reception in Limpopo would be like, should he return, as he is currently running around with a Free State work permit from Celtic, which could get him arrested if Mogaladi does not provide a sworn affidavit on his behalf.Eymael has already signed two contracts in one season &ndash; with City and Celtic &ndash; which is against PSL regulations. Home Affairs could even decline issuing yet another work permit for Eymael.Celtic chief executive Khumbulani Konco has rubbished suggestions that they had booted Eymael.&ldquo;That is untrue &ndash; the fact of the matter is that Eymael has not been part of Celtic since the PSL DC&rsquo;s verdict,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We cannot be seen to be going against a PSL verdict. He must go back to Polokwane.&rdquo;The PSL, through a statement, said yesterday: &ldquo;The suspension of a part of the fine is on condition that Eymael does not take part in any football related activities other than for and on behalf of Polokwane City during the period of suspension.&rdquo;Eymael was also ordered to pay the costs of the DC sitting.
