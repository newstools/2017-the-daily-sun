Minister Jeff Radebe was roasted on twitter, on Sunday.This is after he allegedly asked a presidential photographer, Siyasanga Mbambani, 29, to send him her naked pictures.&nbsp;Radebe was allegedly involved in a series of sex SMSs and emails sent to the young employee at the Unions Buildings in Pretoria, asking for naked pictures of herself.&nbsp;The Sunday Times&nbsp;reported that Radebe, who in January was approached by some ANC branches to vie for the party&rsquo;s leadership and thus become the country&rsquo;s president, had allegedly asked a presidential photographer, Siyasanga Mbambani, 29, for pictures of her private parts.&nbsp; The SMSs and email correspondence between her and Radebe apparently date back to 2014.&nbsp;Mbambani is said to have been suspended by the government information service (GCIS) for alleged &ldquo;improper behaviour&rdquo; and because of the clothes she wears when she is around politicians.&nbsp; Radebe, 64, is the ANC&rsquo;s policy head and has served in every Cabinet since 1994.Attempts to get comment from the Presidency and Radebe&rsquo;s office on Sunday were unsuccessful.&nbsp;The ANC could also not be reached for comment.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/alleged-sex-texts-could-end-radebes-presidential-hopes-20170521
