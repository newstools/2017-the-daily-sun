SAMORA Danisa grew up going to school without shoes because his parents couldn&rsquo;t afford them. After he left school, he decided he would do his best to make sure no one in his community had to go through the same thing. These days, the 34-year-old from Vlakfontein in the Vaal polishes kids&rsquo; shoes every day after school to make sure they look their best. Scores of children line up in front of his house every day to have their shoes polished by Samora and his two helpers. Samora buys polish from the money he makes from his car wash business and polishes close to 80 school shoes every day. He said most of the kids in his kasi were poor and some households couldn&rsquo;t afford polish.&ldquo;I did my research before I started. Every morning I walked children to different schools and checked how they were dressed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I saw the majority of them didn&rsquo;t brush their shoes. &ldquo;I knew I had to do something about this. Children need to look the same at school, despite their circumstances at home.&rdquo; When Samora started his initiative last June, he had fewer than 20 pairs of shoes to clean a week. The number has now risen to 80 a day! Mum of two Prisca Mabasa (38) said: &ldquo;I am a single parent and my duty is to put food on the table for my kids. Samora is a blessing to this community.&rdquo; Another community member, Dimakatso Maano (28), said: &ldquo;If a child doesn&rsquo;t have shoes, Samora goes and looks around until he finds a suitable pair.&rdquo;
