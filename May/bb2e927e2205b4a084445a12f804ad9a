HER attacker pinned her down on the bed and stuffed a cloth into her mouth.As he fumbled to get a condom on his 4-5 with his other hand, he took the cloth from her mouth and tried to keep his hand there . . . But the brave kasi woman bit his finger!One bite was all it took to send the evil man running. The 54-year-old woman told Daily Sun she is now living in fear after the Sunday night incident.&ldquo;I was feeling tired after church and went to bed,&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;It was about 9pm when I heard the door opening and I saw a man whom I recognised entering the house. &ldquo;I tried to scream but he pushed me down on the bed and stuffed a cloth into my mouth. &ldquo;While his hand was blocking my mouth, he used the other one, trying to put the condom on his 4-5.&rdquo;She said the suspect took the cloth out of her mouth and tried to block it with only the hand.&ldquo;That was when I bit his finger because I wanted to leave evidence. He got angry and bit off a piece of my ear. He spat it out and ran away.&rdquo;She reported the incident to her neighbours, and in the morning she went to the cop shop with the piece of her ear and condom packet.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why this man has not been arrested. The evidence is there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know his finger has bruises because I bit down hard on his finger. &ldquo;I often see him roaming the streets. I&rsquo;m scared that he will come back to finish what he started.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of attempted rape and assault was opened.&ldquo;No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating.&rdquo;
