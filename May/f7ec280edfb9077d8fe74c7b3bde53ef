His love for the Marxist and communist theory underpinned his commitment to political education and our struggle for a socialist society,'' said Magaxa.At the time of his passing, Tumisang was serving as an advisor to parliamentary chief whip of the ANC, Jackson Mthembu. He also served the ANC as an organiser and a senior researcher of the ANC caucus in Parliament."We have lost a dedicated organiser, an articulate and competent educator, an advisor, political administrator and a Marxist policy guru. Comrade Tumisang's organisational skills and high level of analytical sophistication will indeed be solely missed in the ranks of the ANC headed alliance,'' he said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sacp-western-cape-first-deputy-provincial-secretary-dies-20170501
