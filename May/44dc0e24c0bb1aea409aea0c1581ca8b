ON SUNDAY night the Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Thabang Makwetla, was hijacked at gunpoint.He was forced to withdraw money, and after that the culprits drove to the North West province and dumped him there.Yesterday his spokesperson Ntime Skhosana said Makwetla was on his way to visit a patient at Life Riverfield Hospital in Johannesburg at about 19:30. When he arrived at the hospital gates, &nbsp;four men wearing balaclava's got out of a vehicle behind his.According to Skhosana they held him at gunpoint, attacked him and took two security guards from the hospital.Makwetla was forced to face down in the back seat of his car while the security guards were put in the boot."They drove to a neighbouring settlement where they demanded his cards and cell phone and then they took him out of his private car, a Range Rover and placed him in their car." said Skhosana.Following that they took Makwetla to the nearest ATM where they withdrew money.The abducted men were then taken to Kgabalatsane near Brits in the North West."They dropped them off and vehicles kept passing them until they found a car on the side of the road and asked the stranger if they could use their cell phone.&rdquo;Sikhosana said the police were called to the scene."He escaped unharmed, unscathed, he is fine. He will be resuming his duties tomorrow."When asked if he thought the incident was politically motivated, Sikhosana said, "It would be prejudicial to enter into any speculation".http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/deputy-justice-minister-hijacked-at-gunpoint-escapes-unharmed-20170522
