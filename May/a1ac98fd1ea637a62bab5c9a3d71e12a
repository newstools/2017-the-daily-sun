BRIAN Molefe expects to be back at work at Eskom today. However, Molefe&rsquo;s return to his CEO job might be difficult, because Cope has plans to physically block him from entering Megawatt Park in Sunninghill, in the north of Joburg. Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said: &ldquo;The time to take action is now! Our plan is at an advanced stage and we are busy talking to other political and civic organisations to join us in this action.&rdquo; He said they were determined to show President Jacob Zuma, the Guptas and Molefe they would not allow anybody to turn Mzansi into a banana republic. &ldquo;Some free advice to Molefe: he must stay away from Megawatt Park to avoid embarrassment,&rdquo; said Bloem. Molefe resigned as an MP on Thursday after it emerged that the Eskom board had decided to reinstate him. He left the top job after his name appeared in former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State capture report. During a media briefing on Friday Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said it was cheaper to reinstate Molefe than it would be to pay out his R30 million pension. DA shadow minister of public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said as the decision was irrational, her party would be approaching the courts to set aside the appointment. &ldquo;We believe Brian Molefe was never entitled to R30 million in the first place.&ldquo;He did not qualify for early retirement as he was under the age of 55 and he had only worked at Eskom for 21 months, meaning he could not have been owed more than R2,5 million,&rdquo; she said. The EFF condemned the reappointment of Molefe. The party said the move was illegal and corrupt.Party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said the EFF was also planning to take the matter to court.
