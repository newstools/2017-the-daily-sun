SHIELD SA announced a groundbreaking partnership with English Premier League champions Chelsea FC yesterday. The deal will see a South African kid win a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend a day training with champions Chelsea at the team&rsquo;s headquarters in Cobham to experience what it&rsquo;s like to play with champions. The competition will take place around five city hubs in Mzansi &ndash; Joburg, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, Port Elizabeth and Durban &ndash; and is open to both girls and boys. To enter, just buy any Shield product, dial *120*744353# and follow the prompts to enter the last four digits of the product&rsquo;s barcode. Chelsea said they would love to acquire an soccer player from Mzansi, but they have stringent selection criteria. The majority of Chelsea players have been with the club since a very young age. That said, the opportunity to train with world class players under world class coaches could still be the start of an exciting journey for a talented youngster. &ldquo;We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Chelsea. This is a life-changing opportunity for the winner who gets to meet the team. Chelsea are known for talent and South Africa has lots of hidden talent,&rdquo; said Gareth Marshall, senior brand manager of Shield SA. It is expected that some 100 kids will participate in the competition in the regions around the five city hubs. They will go through trials under the watchful eye of a judging panel. There will also be surprise visits from Chelsea coaching staff. Chelsea international development manager Ian Woodroffe said he was looking forward to the programme. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance to give youngsters the opportunity to be the best they can be. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about having the best kid coming over for a day. Identifying players is a totally new process,&rdquo; said Woodroffe.
