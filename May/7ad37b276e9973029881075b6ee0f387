MARITZBURG United midfielder Lebogang Maboe says they will need to dig deep to beat the resilient Platinum Stars in the Absa Premiership. However, the 22-year-old promised Team of Choice faithfuls victory when the teams clash at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg tonight (7.30pm). Said Maboe: &ldquo;Everyone will have to give 120% effort to win this game. Platinum Stars are one of the toughest teams in the league. We expect that to be the case again tomorrow. They are difficult to beat but we believe we can do it. &ldquo;We have the upper hand through our home supporters. They are our 12th man.&rdquo;The Team of Choice haven&rsquo;t lost at home since 11 February when they were beaten 2-1 by Kaizer Chiefs. Since then they have won four consecutive home matches. Maboe, who graduated to the senior team from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge team, also said they would be banking on their good run at home to beat Dikwena. He said they had no excuse not to win this one: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve told ourselves we didn&rsquo;t want to lose at home anymore. This is a must-win for us.&rdquo;The former Mbombela United dribbling wizard added that a win against Dikwena would cement their top eight spot. United are currently in seventh place. He added: &ldquo;We still have to play Mamelodi Sundowns away, so we really have to get these three points. We need a top eight finish and are positive we will get it.&rdquo;The midfielder congratulated his interim coach, Fadlu Davids, for winning the PSL Coach of the Month award on Monday. Davids was named April&rsquo;s Coach of the Month after helping United win three out of four matches last month. Davids took charge of United late in March following Roger de Sa&rsquo;s shock resignation as head coach after just two months in charge. Maboe said: &ldquo;He deserves it, I&rsquo;m really happy for him. He&rsquo;s been good to us since taking over. I&rsquo;m sure everyone in the team feels the same way and is happy for him.&rdquo;
