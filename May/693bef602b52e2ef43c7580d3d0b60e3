RETHABILE Qhotsi was watching TV with her siblings last Friday night when a mole crept into the house . . .&nbsp; It moved from one corner to another, and all hell broke loose and they climbed on the bed and screamed for help!&nbsp; Rethabile (26) and her younger brother Koketso eventually killed it. The siblings from Thina Sonke squatter camp in Eden Park, Ekurhuleni, poured paraffin over the animal and burnt it. They put it in a 5-litre bucket and placed a wooden sheet on top of it. The plan was to get rid of it in the morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;But when we woke up, the creature was gone,&rdquo; she claimed.&nbsp; The bucket was empty and the sheet had been placed on the side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Since it disappeared, we have been living in fear because we don&rsquo;t know who took it or where it went.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been to churches, sangomas and prophets, but we&rsquo;re not getting any help.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sangoma Sizakele Mvelase said a mole was a sign of bad luck.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has been sent to bring death and they must get a sangoma who will help them,&rdquo; said Sizakele.&nbsp; &ldquo;When a ground mole moves from one corner to another, it plants muthi.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said it must have been taken by the person who sent it.&nbsp; According to the website www.quora.com, a mole can be helpful. It introduces air into the soil and its kak gives nutrition to plants.&nbsp;
