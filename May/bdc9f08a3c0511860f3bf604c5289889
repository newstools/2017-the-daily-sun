SEVERAL pupils and mourners at the Verena mass funeral for 16 pupils who were killed in a horrific taxi crash had to be escorted to a mobile clinic outside the packed marquee, after some were overwhelmed with grief and collapsed.Twenty people died in the accident last month, including the taxi driver and a general worker at one of the schools.&nbsp;Two more pupils will be buried on Sunday in KwaNongoma in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, respectively.The driver of the mini-bus was buried in Wolvenkop last Saturday.The taxi crashed into a truck on the R25 between Verena and Bronkhorstspruit on 21 April.&nbsp;Pupil after pupil had to be escorted out of the packed marquee, where the funeral service was taking place in Mpumalanga, because they were overcome with emotion and cried uncontrollably.&nbsp;Many mourners also had to be carried out on stretchers after fainting during proceedings.Parents, friends and community members were inconsolable as they cried and screamed.&nbsp;Some mourners were comforted by nurses, social workers and counsellors.&nbsp;Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga said: &ldquo;It is the darkest day of this nation and we share in your grief.&nbsp;&ldquo;On my way here, the words of a verse from the book of Job 1:21 came to me, which reads: I came naked from my mother&rsquo;s womb and I will be naked when I leave. The Lord gave me what I had and he has taken it away. And praise be the name of the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp;She also cited a verse from the book of Timothy, saying humans come into the world with nothing and, when they die, they leave with nothing.&nbsp;She urged the mourners to be calm and accept what had happened.&ldquo;Do not be angry with yourselves for what has happened to you. It is the will of the God Almighty.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is not a time or place to apportion blame and we plead with the families and the pupils to accept that our beautiful children have slipped into the next world,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Motshekga said despite the gruesome accident, she was certain the deceased were resting in peace.&nbsp;&ldquo;The only memory that we can carry forward in the name of these beautiful souls is to know and understand that road safety is everybody&rsquo;s responsibility.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not suggesting in any way that this is normal, but I&rsquo;m saying road safety is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.&nbsp;&ldquo;We can turn the tide of fatal accidents and avoid the pain we are going through today as a nation,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;She concluded by reading a scripture, saying there&rsquo;s a time for everything &ndash; a time to live and a time to die.&nbsp;&ldquo;Though time does not heal fully, it makes the pain bearable,&rdquo; said Motshekga.&ndash; News24&nbsp;
