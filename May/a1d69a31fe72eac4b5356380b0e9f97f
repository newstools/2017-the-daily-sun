ARRIE Williams wants his house back!The 58-year-old from Duncan Village, East London in the Eastern Cape said he was allocated an RDP house in 2006 while living in a squatter camp.&ldquo;I was allocated a house at Amalinda Forest. Before moving in I decided to hire people to plaster the house. &ldquo;Days later when I went to check on the house I found people had moved in,&rdquo; he said. Arrie, who currently lives with his in-laws, said he tried to evict the people but to no avail. &ldquo;They said they were told by the former MEC to occupy all the houses that had been finished but were unoccupied in order to avoid them getting vandalised.&rdquo; Arrie said he has written to the Buffalo City Metro Municipality (BCMM) as well as the Eastern Cape human settlements department but has not received much help. He said: &ldquo;I am a disabled person who lost a leg due to diabetes and the place I live in is unbearable.&rdquo;Ntomboxolo Bentani (51) does not deny that she is occupying Arrie&rsquo;s house illegally. She said: &ldquo;Arrie and I are in the same boat because my house is here and is occupied by another person. That is why I moved into this one until the situation is rectified.&rdquo; BCMM spokesperson Sibusiso Cindi said the municipality only provided land for the Amalinda Co-op project. The co-op was responsible for allocation and relocation. &ldquo;Mr Williams is supposed to take his matter to the co-op committee leadership,&rdquo; said Cindi. However, &ldquo;the BCMM, as well as the national and provincial housing departments, have decided to intervene and to assist those members who never got their houses because of the co-op&rsquo;s internal administration issues.&rdquo;
