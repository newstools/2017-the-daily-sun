At our age we no longer want to be living in the same space we lived in when we were kids,” said Thulasizwe Sithole, a community leader.Thulasizwe believes they should at least be allocated land to occupy while waiting for their houses. “Seeing people moving into houses meant for us is heartbreaking. We will continue to protest until we hear a constructive solution as to where we are going from here. We don’t want anything from them except land. We are tired of lies,” he said. Police fired rubber bullets to calm the situation as stones were constantly being thrown at them. Mxolisi Xayiya from the office of the premier visited the area to hear the protesters’ grievances. He said: “We hear what you are protesting about and understand your frustration. I am aware of housing projects that took place in this area but am not sure what happened after that. “I will contact the MEC and MMC as well as the municipality to address you on what went wrong.”Residents vowed to protest until they were satisfied with the officials’ response.
