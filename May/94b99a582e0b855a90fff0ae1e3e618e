ESKOM CEO Brian Molefe said it’s untrue that he was involved in coal contract negotiations with the Gupta-owned company Tegeta. He told parliament’s standing committee on public accounts yesterday that he only became the CEO of the power utility a month after a contract was signed with Tegeta’s Brakfontein colliery in 2015. The committee is probing the power utility on non-compliance issues relating to its coal contracts, highlighted in a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvf1ESxXK0xhL55bC8Q3Ab29scf8je2BGnNf1a9A93NStGfY0WjEdEsRxd98IStrh63vWm8BeJiBCHYjaOTcm-w8SwokqBZbuNCeCg0FopwI4_5ZjwF1iL1Q2uobXBHPPb_n6sQyU3qku5upixW0IzCMY9ziX4aL0JDVaoBHZ72od9O46X75g5n_QNzf1zKnVKvgG5aAAsPCFiqtsjODjNMDsktqMZjU4k843PHWiFab99VtGdmiHbfOmUyyP5qBuCEXmnmB6Ze8a4kAByDBcbZNqAbUc8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGS02h7SBaCaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Meanwhile, the EFF said they wanted the power utility to cancel its multi-billion rand contract with Brakfontein Colliery.
