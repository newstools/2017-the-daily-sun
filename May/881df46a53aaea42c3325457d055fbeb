THE change of season has its impact on people.&nbsp;The chilly autumn mornings are coming to an end, winter is approaching. That is when most people get cold and end up with flu. Some opt for flu shots and others use natural antibiotics.Carl Thobane (38) from Meadowlands believes that a human body can fight anything that not good for it. He is keen on natural ways of healing, and so far it has been working out well for him &ndash;&ensp;because he doesn&rsquo;t get sick often.&ldquo;I love taking care of my body and I make sure that I look after myself.Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by flu viruses.&nbsp;&ldquo;We need to be aware of what we eat and that plays a big part on how our body reacts to certain illnesses,&rdquo; said Carl.&nbsp;Carl uses natural herbs to heal his flu especially in this cold weather.&ldquo;I also eat fruits and vegetables that are used as antibiotics and high in vitamin C. I also discovered some ginger tea that can be very useful and help with flu,&rdquo; added Carl.&nbsp;Personal trainer Solomzi Zini said people have different body types and they should know what works for them.&nbsp;&ldquo;Some can burn the flu out in the gym and others need medication. Traditional home remedies work for a few, and others rely on medication,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;For people with flu and who want to go to gym, Solomzi suggests what he calls functional training.&ldquo;When you have flu it means your body is already under stress. So you don&rsquo;t have to add more stress by working out as a healthy person. You need to do moderate activities.&nbsp;&ldquo;I do fast-paced walks because I&rsquo;m one of the people who need medication when they get flu,&rdquo; added Solomzi.&nbsp;He added that drinking hot water also helps because cold water slows down the healing process.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hot water helps with the heart too,&rdquo; said Solomzi.Dr Brian Tladi from Diepkloof Surgery said that people can go the organic route of treating flu &ndash; but he has conditions.&nbsp;&ldquo;A mild flu can be treated organically,&rdquo; said Doctor Tladi.He went on to say: &ldquo;I recommend food that&rsquo;s rich in Vitamin C.&nbsp;&ldquo;We recommend vaccination to people who are at risk of getting flu frequently and people who have chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes and infections such as HIV.&nbsp;&ldquo;People should consult to know what type of flu they have before trying to treat it,&rdquo; said the doctor.&nbsp;Pregnant women can also be vaccinated. He said that healthy people who look after what they eat and frequently go to the gym are not at risk of getting flu because their body is active.&nbsp;&ldquo;Someone like a personal trainer is not at risk of getting flu like a person who is not active. They just need to check because there are different types of symptoms,&rdquo; he said&nbsp;Dr Tladi described the symptoms below as generalized signs of flu:Fever;Coldness and chills;&nbsp;Muscle and joint pain;&nbsp;A tight chest If you have any of those symptoms you should go for a check-up because it might not be just flu but pneumonia.&nbsp;&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no organic way of treating pneumonia. The patient must have a correct prescription,&rdquo; added Dr Tladi.
