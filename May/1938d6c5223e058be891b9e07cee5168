KAIZER Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; Khune might be missing out on action on the field, but he is allegedly not missing out on love.&nbsp;The Bafana Bafana goalkeeper is said to have found love in the arms of former Greed &amp; Desire actress Kamo Letsosa.&nbsp;A soccer insider said: &ldquo;She is madly in love. It&rsquo;s a pity we can&rsquo;t say that about Itu because everyone knows how soccer stars behave.&nbsp;&ldquo;Kamo loves Itu, and it will be a pity if he disappoints her after he has been disappointed in his previous relationships. They have been dating for three months.&rdquo;&nbsp;Another source said: &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t keep their hands off each other. We have seen them together at places, and she is always with Itumeleng&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe this time, Itumeleng has found the right woman for him because Kamo is not a liker of things &ndash; like the other girls Itumeleng has dated,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;Khune is known for dating TV personality Minnie Dlamini and personal trainer Sibahle Mpisane, who announced their break-up on Instagram.&nbsp;When called for comment, Kamo hung up the phone.&nbsp;Khune was not available to comment.&nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs spokesperson Vina Maphosa said he could not comment on personal matters of players and requested us to send an email. &ldquo;If the player wishes to comment, he will call you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
