THE ABSA Premiership race is heading for a nail-biting finish!Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns kept their hopes of retaining their title alive when they swept away Orlando Pirates 2-0 at the Orlando Stadium yesterday to move into second place with three matches remaining.Downs are now on 54 points, three behind leaders Bidvest Wits, who took a step closer to claiming their first ever Premiership title when they scored a 1-0 win over Maritzburg United at Milpark yesterday.The Brazilians were full value for their three points against a side they beat 6-0 at Loftus Versfeld earlier this year.But it does not get any easier for the defending PSL and African champions this week. On Wednesday the Brazilians host relegation-haunted Baroka FC at Lucas Moripe Stadium and on Saturday they play their opening match in the group phase of the Caf Champions League when they entertain Ethiopian champions Saint George at the same venue on Saturday.Also on Wednesday, Wits travel to Bethlehem&rsquo;s Goble Park for their clash with another side deep in the relegation zone, Free State Stars, while CT City have a tough away trip to Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow where they face SuperSport United.Bucs found themselves on the back foot from the kick-off. Downs had a penalty claim turned down when Mzikayise Mashaba went down under a Happy Jele challenge inside the danger area on 22 minutes.It was no surprise when the visitors took the lead via a Khama Billiat header on 25 minutes.The goal woke up Bucs. But Downs&rsquo; classy keeper Denis Onyango rescued his side with two brilliant saves &ndash; the first when he turned Ayanda Gcaba&rsquo;s shot for a corner on the half hour and then when he miraculously pushed away a goal-bound Issa Sarr header in injury time. It was game over when Downs&rsquo; Yannick Zakri took advantage of the confused Bucs defence to make it 2-0 three minutes after the restart.Platinum Stars beat bottom side Highlands Park 1-0 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in yesterday&rsquo;s other fixture.
