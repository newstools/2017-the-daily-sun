THE flood waters have come and gone, but the damaged houses remain. Residents from Sunrise View, Rustenburg, North West said it&rsquo;s been months since the floods, but nothing has been done to help them. Joseph Mogakwe, who belongs to a task team formed by residents to monitor the process, said: &ldquo;Nothing happens without the knowledge of the municipality.&ldquo;We want to know who approved the development of these houses?&rdquo; He said they have requested the municipality to move them to a safer area. &ldquo;We believe our safety and dignity has been compromised.&rdquo; Joseph said during a meeting with Rustenburg Municipality officials, the municipality agreed to speak to Impala Platinum, banks and other organisations to arrange a meeting where they can discuss a solution. That never happened.Clearance Mongwe, one of the homeowners, said he is living in a guesthouse and it is difficult financially. &ldquo;The question is whether houses should be rebuilt here and should we risk our lives again? We don&rsquo;t know where we stand,&rdquo; said Clearance.Municipal spokesman Andrew Seome said it was not a municipal issue because the houses were not RDPs. &ldquo;It was a business transaction between Impala Platinum and the bank,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We are only assisting and the powers do not rest with us. What is happening there is a private matter.&rdquo;Alice Lourens, corporate relations manager at Impala Platinum, said the houses were built by a private developer after formal approval from the municipality. &ldquo;Impala Platinum acquired some of these houses from the developer. The floods and consequent damage to these houses are clearly not a result of negligence on our part,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These houses do not belong to Impala Platinum and the homeowners are responsible for their repair.&rdquo;
