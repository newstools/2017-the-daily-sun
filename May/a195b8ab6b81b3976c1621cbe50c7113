IT WAS blow for blow as the two top cops briefed the Portfolio Committee on Police yesterday. Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) head Robert McBride accused acting police commissioner General Khomotso Phahlane of interfering in corruption cases. &ldquo;When Ipid was investigating the SAPS, they formed their own teams to investigate Ipid members. We are a constitutional body and can&rsquo;t be counter-investigated,&rdquo; he said.Phahlane said McBride was out to destroy him, using unfounded allegations. He said he had appointed a team to investigate a security breach and that team was under investigation by Ipid. Matthews Sesoko, Ipid chief director of investigations, claimed Phahlane had been made aware of the investigation and had contacted witnesses and asked them not to co-operate. He accused Phahlane of using a murderous SAPS unit to deal with Ipid.Phahlane said he had not interfered with investigations, but worried about how private investigator Paul O&rsquo; Sullivan was handling the matter. He claimed Ipid was being run by O&rsquo;Sullivan. Responding to Ipid&rsquo;s view that Phahlane should be suspended or placed on leave, Phahlane angrily responded: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to co-operate with Ipid investigations.&rdquo; When the EFF&rsquo;s Phillip Mhlongo said something was wrong as other top cops were not present to support Phahlane, he responded that they were busy. Committee chairman Frans Beukman said he wanted Minister Fikile Mbalula to be at the next meeting.
