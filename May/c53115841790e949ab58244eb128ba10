A 20-YEAR-OLD pupil who allegedly moered his teacher will be spending the rest of the week at home preparing an apology. The grade 11 pupil from Matatane High School in Dalton, KZN, allegedly stepped on his teacher&rsquo;s laptop, which was on the ground next to the classroom&rsquo;s entrance. An argument ensued and the teacher was allegedly attacked. Other teachers had to intervene and the pupil was sent home and told to come back with his parents. The chairman of the SGB, Vusumuzi Ngubane, told Daily Sun they condemned the pupil&rsquo;s actions. &ldquo;Pupils are supposed to be respectful.&rdquo; &ldquo;The school&rsquo;s by-law states clearly that a pupil who commits such an offence should be suspended,&rdquo; said Ngubane. He said that during a meeting on Tuesday between the assaulted teacher, the pupil&rsquo;s parents, the principal, other teachers and the SGB, the pupil was told to apologise. Ngubane said the teacher and the father of the pupil had met and agreed that the laptop would be replaced. School officials and the teacher, however, still wanted the pupil to apologise at assembly so that other pupils would learn that such behaviour had consequences. Ngubane said they decided to sort the matter out at school without involving the police. The pupil who allegedly attacked the teacher refused to comment. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department had not been informed of the incident. &ldquo;But it is very sad that a pupil can do that to a teacher, who is also like his parent. &ldquo;It is a good thing the school has taken disciplinary action,&rdquo; said Mahlambi.
