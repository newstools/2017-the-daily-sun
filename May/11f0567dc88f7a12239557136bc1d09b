MEET the PSL&rsquo;s Juju man! This muthi man has the golden touch.Put it this way, every touch of the ball by Daine Klate becomes a winning move. But instead of the &ldquo;Juju man&rdquo; tag, the 32-year-old from Port Elizabeth prefers to be called &ldquo;a winner&rdquo;.Klate is the most successful player in the PSL, having won six league titles and all domestic cups in the PSL &ndash; the MTN8, Nedbank Cup and the Telkom Knockout. He has won the league titles with:SuperSport United in the 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 season; andOrlando Pirates in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 season.And now the ageing Klate has helped Wits write their name in golden letters on the PSL board listing clubs that have won the Absa Premiership.Since their formation in 1921, Wits have not come close to winning the title until they employed coach Gavin Hunt three seasons ago &ndash; and what a good buy.There were celebrations all around the Milpark campus of the university on Wednesday after the final whistle had gone as Wits defeated Polokwane City 2-0 to amass an unbeatable 60 points in 29 matches.This points tally is out of reach of their closest rivals, Mamelodi Sundowns, even if they win their remaining match against Highlands Park on 27 May.Downs drew 2-2 with Maritzburg United on the same day.Klate contributed to Wits&rsquo; victorious night by hammering in the second goal, adding to James Keene&rsquo;s opener. Hunt went wild after seeing on his SuperSport Walka that Downs were actually trailing against Maritzburg.&ldquo;Whether I am a muthi man I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said a joyous Klate jokingly. &ldquo;I am a winner! &ldquo;I try to contribute positively on and off the field. Moeneeb (Josephs) and I have to lead by example, not only with words, but on the field. We just want to be a positive influence on youngsters. &ldquo;Last season I came in and was a top goal-scorer, only because I am a team player. My teammates get the energy off me sometimes and when the chips are down, I have to dig deep for leadership. &ldquo;All I bring to the team is a winning mentality. I never want to lose &ndash; I am the one that&rsquo;s vocal in the change-room. That&rsquo;s why the coach brought me here, I am used to winning. I think I am just a positive influence in any team.&rdquo; The humble Klate played down his many successes, praising Hunt, his teammates, the technical staff and the management for the Clever Boys&rsquo; success. &ldquo;A good season for me at Wits once more with the MTN8 cup and the league,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But the focus is on the club, it&rsquo;s not about me. I will focus on my achievements when I am done playing football. &ldquo;I will reflect and take stock of what I&rsquo;ve achieved. I&rsquo;ve watched this club for four years. We came so close last season and now we&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;
