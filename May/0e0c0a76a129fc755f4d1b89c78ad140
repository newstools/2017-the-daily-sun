&ldquo;GIVE us our allowances now!&rdquo;Students shouted as they marched to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme headquarters in Wynberg on Friday.The march was led by Sasco president Thabo Moloja.He said they are no longer asking for the money but are demanding what is due to them.&ldquo;The money injected into NSFAS is not theirs, it is our money given to us by the government,&rdquo; he said.Moloja said that the centralisation of NSFAS is not working. The fund has changed the system. Previously students applied to their tertiary institutions of choice and those institutions then helped arrange the NSFAS funding for the students.Now the students first apply for funding approval to NSFAS through the new centralised system, list their &ldquo;wish list&rdquo; of institutions where they hope to study and then take that financial approval to the institutions to apply for a place. Students also apply for a loan online and use cellphone-generated vouchers to pay for books and food.&ldquo;There are difficulties and delays with this new online application system,&rdquo; said Moloja.Cape Peninsula University of Technology second-year student Nosisa Mahlasela (20) said: &ldquo;My application was approved, but I have not received food vouchers or book allowances. I depend on campus slides to study.&rdquo;The fund was given 14 working days to respond to demands.The fund&rsquo;s CEO, Lerato Nage, accepted the memorandum.&ldquo;We have heard you. We will sit down and try to get to the bottom of this,&rdquo; she said.
