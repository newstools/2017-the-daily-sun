FORMER Bafana Bafana star Jabu Mahlangu walked away from a car crash without a scratch!&nbsp;According to sources, the accident happened in the morning while Jabu was on his way to work in Pretoria last month.A source close to the situation said Jabu was travelling alone at the time.Said the source: &ldquo;His car spun out of control and hit road barricades.&rdquo;The source said Jabu was not injured, but his latest car is a complete write-off.&ldquo;Fortunately, he was alone and there were no other cars around when he lost control of his car.&ldquo;Oncoming traffic avoided hitting him,&rdquo; said the source.Another source told the People&rsquo;s Paper that after the accident, Jabu called his family and employers to let them know what had happened.Said the source: &ldquo;He then called his insurance company, which came to fetch the car.&rdquo;The source further said Jabu was advised to go and see doctor to check if he suffered any internal injuries.&ldquo;He looked fine at the accident scene, but you know that after an accident, you might seem okay, only to start feeling the pain later,&rdquo; said the source.The source added that Jabu visited the doctor the following day and was given a clean bill of health.Efforts to get comment from Jabu were unsuccessful, as his phone rang unanswered.The former soccer player had also failed to respond to our SMSes at the time of going to print.&ldquo;The accident happened at a time when Jabu was no longer drinking. If it was during those days when he used to drink, we&rsquo;d say he was drunk, but he was sober.&rdquo;&nbsp;
