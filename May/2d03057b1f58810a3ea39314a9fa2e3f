POLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula visited Shoprite at Nyanga Junction, Cape Town on Tuesday.This was where 10 people were held hostage for about 12 hours after an attempted armed robbery on Monday.Mbalula said they were there to support and show gratitude to the police and task teams who worked tirelessly to make sure that people were safe and that the suspects didn&rsquo;t get away with any money.&ldquo;We will use all our efforts to make sure the criminals are put in their place, because we cannot be bullied by criminals,&rdquo; said Mbalula.When he was asked why the cops were not on guard because they know that there are many criminals in the Western Cape, Mbalula said: &ldquo;We should have been on guard. We knew there would be a pension payout, so we should have been ready before the incident.&rdquo;He said that the community should have a good relationship with the cops so together they could fight crime.&ldquo;We are coming for criminals. The party is over for them. This country cannot be ruled by criminals. We will deal with them,&rdquo; said the minister.A security guard who was shot by the suspects on Monday died on Tuesday morning. Mbalula said what the criminals did was cruel, because they killed an innocent person who was trying to make a living and feed his family. The minister said illegal guns were a problem because they were being used in criminal activities. &ldquo;Residents should report criminals to the police because by doing so, they will be helping themselves. &ldquo;These criminals are the ones terrorising communities.&rdquo;
