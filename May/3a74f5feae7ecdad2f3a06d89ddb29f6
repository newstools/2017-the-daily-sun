THE ANCYL in the Free State says labour federation Cosatu's May Day rally will expose the political immaturity of alliance leaders who are calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down.The league in the province is mobilising its members to attend the rally in their numbers to &ldquo;show support for Zuma&rdquo;, said newly re-elected chairperson Makalo Mohale.The Worker&rsquo;s Day commemorations are expected to be attended by both Zuma&rsquo;s friends and foes, with divisions within the tripartite alliance expected to play out. It will be the first time he shares a public stage with both SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande and Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini, after both organisations called on him to go.Speaking to News24 just hours before the international holiday, Mohale said those calling for Zuma not to deliver the keynote address at Loch Logan stadium in Bloemfontein were misleading the public.&ldquo;Much as we have heard there are others who did not want the president to speak at the event, we the ANC Youth League deem that as disingenuous,&rdquo; said Mohale.He also believes the rally will show that workers do not support decisions by their leaders in Cosatu. The federation&rsquo;s highest decision making body called for Zuma to go last month, after he changed his executive without consulting them and the SACP.&nbsp;&ldquo;We still believe that workers love Jacob Zuma, even though their leaders have different views. That will be demonstrated,&rdquo; he said.Tensions within Cosatu heightened after the largest affiliate Nehawu wrote to the mother body, demanding that Zuma be replaced as main speaker at the event by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. They were backed by two other affiliates, CWU and Sadtu, who also believed that allowing Zuma to speak at the main rally would send a &ldquo;confusing message&rdquo; after they called for him to go. Some provincial Cosatu structures, including Gauteng, backed the call.Cosatu has however defended its decision, saying it sent an invitation to the 105-year-old liberation movement and cannot dictate who it decides to deploy to the May Day rally. The ANC deployed Zuma to Bloemfontein, while Ramaphosa will be in Mpumalanga province.Cosatu provincial secretary in the Free State, Manyatso Mahlatsi, he had heard plans for the president to be booed and said such behaviour would not be tolerated."If anyone boos any of the leaders we will call them out from the podium," said Mahlatsi.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/may-day-rally-will-show-that-workers-love-zuma-ancyl-20170501
