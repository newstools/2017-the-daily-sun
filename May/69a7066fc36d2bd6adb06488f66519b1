COPS are silent about their investigation into the cause of a fire that gutted a building housing important police files and documents.The building, situated right behind the cop shop in Dullstroom, near Belfast in Mpumalanga, went up in flames in the early hours of Friday morning. By the time cops noticed the blaze it was already eating the roof of the building, having gutted everything in its way inside. Only the exterior of the building remained intact, while everything inside was reduced to ashes.A cop who did not want to be named said there was nothing in the building that was flammable or that could be used to start a fire. &ldquo;Whatever was used to start this fire was brought here from elsewhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The cause was definitely deliberate.&rdquo;Forensic investigators were still gathering up bits of evidence yesterday. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We do not want to speculate on the cause of the fire.&ldquo;However, if it was deliberately set we call on the community to work with the police by giving information that will lead to the arrest of suspects.&rdquo;
