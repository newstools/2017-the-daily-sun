CHILDREN from destitute families in Limpopo can study at tertiary institutions while being supported by the Limpopo Tourism Agency and Legend Foundation. Their R141 650 cheque will contribute to the Premier&rsquo;s Bursary fund that was started to fund underprivileged students&rsquo; studies.Money was raised during the Telkom Supersport Shootout golf challenge last year and the cheque was handed over to the fund yesterday. Agency board chairman Andrew Dipela said their contribution to helping the needy will go a long way. They will ensure no child from a poor family background is denied access to study.&ldquo;Our contribution is to a worthy cause that needs to be supported because it ensures children from destitute families can study. We&rsquo;re hosting another event this month to continue raising money to help others.&rdquo; Premier Stan Mathabatha said the funds will increase the skilled population and ensure they attract more money. &ldquo;Quality education is important. Every year we get requests from destitute children and you can see from their eyes their need for education. Working together we can do more.&rdquo; Acting Agency CEO Bibi Kotsedi said: &ldquo;We will continue bidding to host major local and international events as it will make a positive contribution to the fight against poverty and unemployment.&rdquo;
