THE Western Cape has been declared a disaster area.Premier Helen Zille said this step was in response to the current drought crisis, the worst in over 112 years.&ldquo;The declaration is no cause to panic,&rdquo; said Zille. &ldquo;It increases control by affording the province additional powers of intervention.&rdquo;The most immediate interventions in coming days will be the drilling of boreholes at hospitals, followed by schools in high-risk, water scarce areas. The declaration will be formally gazetted this week and was signed by Zille during a Cabinet meeting last week. The disaster declaration will be valid for a three-month period, which can be extended if necessary.The Disaster Management Act empowers provincial government to protect key frontline service delivery points by re-prioritising funding.Environmental impact assessments will be hurried up to test a mobile desalination plant at Koeberg and drill into Table Mountain rock containing groundwater. Groundwater specialists will be appointed in each district to identify, co-ordinate and manage main sources. The state of water restrictions at different municipalities will also be assessed. The disaster declaration enables the province to give instructions for possible changes that may be necessary in each different area.Zille urged residents to continue with the current water saving measures and to stick to restrictions. She added that the current drought also presents South Africans with an opportunity to innovate and act responsibly in the way they make use of their water resources.&ldquo;The disaster declaration will speed up the province&rsquo;s disaster management centre&rsquo;s Avoiding Day Zero project, a strategy to ensure that taps do not run dry,&rdquo; said Zille.
