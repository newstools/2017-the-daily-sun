He then went to the woman’s relatives who lived a few blocks away, to ask for the keys to enter her home.He then tried to enter through the main entrance but failed, but gained entry through another door.“When he got inside he found the children on the bed. They were under a blanket. When he tried to move them he realised they were not breathing and called the neighbours and asked for help.”A double murder case has been opened.The whereabouts of the children’s mother is still unknown and all her cellphones were found inside the house. The main entrance had been blocked with a sofa.There were no signs of any injuries on the children. Results from post-mortems would reveal what the cause of their deaths was, Sebola said.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/father-discovers-children-dead-after-receiving-call-from-mother-20170521
