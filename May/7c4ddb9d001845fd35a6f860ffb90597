TWENTY-THREE members of the Dube family have been left homeless. This was after a mystery fire ate 11 of their shacks in KwaDlangezwa, Empangeni.Worried mum Nelisiwe Dube (52) said the vutha has been ruining their lives since January. &ldquo;When it first happened, we thought the fire was caused by the negligence of one of the family members. &ldquo;However, when it struck again in February, we realised that something was strange. &ldquo;The fire can spread so quickly that things get burnt within a split second,&rdquo; said Nelisiwe.She said they have been left with no clothes, furniture or proper shelter. &ldquo;The shacks burnt one by one with all our belongings. The latest incident was on Sunday, when we saw a sofa just burning while we were in the shack.&rdquo; She told Daily Sun that most of the family were pupils, and they had lost their school uniforms. &ldquo;Most of the adults are unemployed, including myself. Our situation is difficult, because we don&rsquo;t have money to rebuild the shacks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve consulted a few sangomas, but they couldn&rsquo;t help us.&rdquo; Sazi Mhlongo, president of the Traditional Healers Association of SA, said the family should consult a strong inyanga, who would give them strong muthi to sprinkle in their yard to chase away the vutha spell. &ldquo;Normally, vutha is sent by an enemy who wants to see the victim suffer. It won&rsquo;t go away until their yard has been cleansed.&rdquo;
