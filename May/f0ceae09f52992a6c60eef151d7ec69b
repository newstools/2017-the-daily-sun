A SHOWDOWN between International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Association and International Boxing Organisation heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury is a remote possibility, as the former champ still has to regain his physical form and boxing licence, promoter Eddie Hearn has said.Joshua beat Wladimir Klitschko after 11 rounds on Saturday to win three of the four heavyweight titles that belonged to Fury, who relinquished all of them in 2015 after his licence was suspended pending an investigation for doping and medical issues.The heavyweight rivals have been talking about a match-up since last week when they exchanged barbs on Twitter. Fury challenged Joshua after his victory at Wembley, saying he can beat AJ with one arm tied behind my back .Hearn, who is planning Joshua s schedule, said Fury still had a lot of hurdles to clear before a fight could be arranged. We are desperate for that fight because AJ thinks he will win comfortably. It is a great fight, it is the biggest fight out there, Hearn told talkSPORT. But we can only concentrate on AJ s career and guiding him. Fury is miles away from fighting. He is in a terrible physical way at the moment. He doesn t have a licence, he needs to go back to the British Boxing Board and is under investigation for (an alleged) failed doping test. No one wants to see him back more than we do, but it is miles away. He is not the next fight he won t be ready in time. Joshua, who extended his unbeaten run to 19 fights, could face Klitschko in a rematch or challenge either Deontay Wilder (World Boxing Council champ) or Joseph Parker (World Boxing Organisation champ) for his next match.
