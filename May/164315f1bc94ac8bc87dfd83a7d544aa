THE number of anonymous abandonments has increased, which means there is very little chance of the abandoned kids ever being reunited with their biological families. This highlights the continued importance of child protection strategies such as adoption. Sadly, the number of adoptions remains extremely low in South Africa, with only 1 349 adoptions taking place in 2016/2017.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvNn8S8FOz96prk4AzOcP-nl-rLdvv9Oa-E9k_9UBxZVnlVdY5DFNw9zpItsvtQebmyna1lLvFCwtW4s-ImGji0cDyksCc26VspBkQu2IAyvvO-nnmWOya_P8NyN7jinCDl6rzX7BDG-QkJh0ZsZdZLLwyt8EH2Duo5_DxOeITQYMuuVCu-cWe91Xkjh0zz5Wx4ICe1Amvt5lpb2ARguoBMT9PD3vRRI4QYjIR6pjLNI_eBpVsg6S-PnoMlXCTFg5mMV93iFLfXO-MQBZ8k69-LaJ227PI\x26sai\x3dAMfl-YSGs6uBI90P78xf5ZjzQAarKWoKAwTqJNauIRyxdJnn2tUIzfyw-JFa6X0Xt-c3OmJ9NtUlEaNLd7vESgIxJnv1EqQFy843QMgiY3S5\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEuzWtbz5e_5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

A new campaign to deal with adoption was launched. The initiative was announced on Tuesday at the Princess Alice Home in Joburg ahead of Child Protection Week.According to the coalition, 26 organisations representing 33 NGO-run Child and Youth Care Centres took part in the research, which amounts to 10% of registered child centres in South Africa. The research found the number of children abandoned by their families has declined, especially in Gauteng and KZN. However, the number of anonymous abandonments is increasing.Katinka Pieterse, chair of the adoption coalition, said reasons given by child protection officers for the increase in anonymous abandonment include a lack of support or social services for foreign mothers. Dee Blackie, a campaign co-ordinator and child protection activist, said: “A major concern is an increase in the number of premature and severely disabled abandoned children. Not only are these children abandoned, but they must then live with a disability or disorder that will impact them for the rest of their lives.”
