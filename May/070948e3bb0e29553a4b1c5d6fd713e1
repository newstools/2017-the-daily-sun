RESIDENTS of Nquthu in northern KZN went back to the polling booths yesterday to vote in a by-election for a functioning municipality. Co-operative governance and traditional affairs MEC Nomusa Dube-Ncube dissolved the Nquthu Municipality in February following its failure to elect a council after the August 2016 local government elections.Without a mayor, deputy mayor and speaker, the municipality could neither hold council meetings nor deliver services to residents.Police maintained visibility at all 116 voting stations whileleaders of different political parties were also spotted checking if residents were voting freely without any form of intimidation.Among the leaders present were ANC provincial chairman Sihle Zikalala, the DA&rsquo;s Zwakele Mncwango, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and NFP provincial chairman Vikizitha Mlotshwa.Resident Nompilo Makhaye (26) from KwaLuvisi said she voted for the first time and was hopeful her vote would contribute to bringing peace. &ldquo;Previously I didn&rsquo;t care about voting. In fact I vowed that I wouldn&rsquo;t get involved with politics.&ldquo;But during the recent chaos when our municipality was unable to elect a council I realised the need to cast my vote. I believe that it will make a difference,&rdquo; said Nompilo.KZN Independent Electoral Commission spokesman Thabani Ngwira said all voting stations opened on time and people came in numbers. No incidents were reported.The results will be released later today.
