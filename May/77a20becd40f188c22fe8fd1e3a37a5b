Councillor Nonhlanhla Makhuba, Joburg MMC for transport, condemned the attack on the buses.“We are currently tightening our legislation to ensure that those responsible for random damage of government property meant to serve the community will face the full might of the law,” she said.The latest round of protest action follows a week-long standoff between police and Princess residents on Albertina Sisulu Road, where two trucks were torched. A man from a towing company had to be rescued by police after a petrol bomb was thrown at him while he was trying to tow the trucks away.Resident Kutlwano Molemo told Daily Sun: “Service delivery in this area is very poor because we live in informal settlements. They don’t care about us.”JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “We are warning motorists to avoid using South Road until further notice. We tried to clear the roads for motorists but the residents just came back and blocked the streets again, which led to the residents retaliating by throwing rocks.“We had to fire warning shots in retaliation as the protest intensified.”
