WHEN her mum told her no man would ever marry her and she&rsquo;d live her life as a playground for men, Nokulunga Masondo didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. But now the 38-year-old mum of four from Mafusini near Dannhauser, northern KZN, believes her mum cursed her. The prediction has come true! Nokulunga said she had four kids, aged between four and 16, from three different fathers. All the men dumped her and abandoned their kids. The sad mum said her problems started in 1995 when she was just 16. &ldquo;My mother found out I had started dating. She got angry and beat me. She cursed me by saying men would get me pregnant but no one would marry me.&rdquo; Nokulunga said her first child was born in 2001 and the dad disappeared a year later.Her mum died in the same year. &ldquo;My baby daddy just left me for no reason. He said I must leave him alone because he wanted nothing to do with me.&rdquo; Nokulunga said in 2003 she dated another man who also dumped her after she got pregnant. &ldquo;That was when I remembered my mum had cursed me. &ldquo;I went to the sangoma for help and a hen was slaughtered to cleanse me. I thought the curse had been lifted but I was wrong. In 2009, I got pregnant again and the baby&rsquo;s father supported me. I had another child in 2013 but then he left. I need help to chase the curse away.&rdquo; Nokulunga&rsquo;s aunt Mathombi (65) said the family didn&rsquo;t know how to help her.Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, advised Nokulunga to go to a sangoma to have a goat slaughtered so she can be cleansed.
