PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma launched the People's Train in Tshwane on Tuesday.Zuma urged the Metrorail commuters not to vandalise the new trains.In 2016, gatvol passengers burnt and vandalised a number of Metrorail trains in Gauteng and the Western Cape.The president says the country has experienced shocking incidents where people burn trains because they arrived late at the station and made them late for work. "That is too drastic and is totally unacceptable," said Zuma outside the Pretoria station.According to Zuma, acts of vandalism and serious crimes such as the burning of trains and cable theft undermine the efforts of improving the quality of life for commuters who use Metrorail services.Zuma said as government hands over such infrastructure to the people it must be handled with care. "These are your trains. Look after them so that they can carry you for many years to come." said&nbsp; Zuma.Government is investing large amounts of money to improve the way South Africans travel, R51 billion has been spent on new trains as well as R4 billion on new hybrid locomotives.The modernisation is expected to include the upgrading of depots, upgrading of signalling and overhead lines, railway tracks and platform correction.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-pleads-with-commuters-dont-burn-new-metrorail-trains-20170509
