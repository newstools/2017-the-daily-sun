THE OR Tambo Initiation Forum is on high alert ahead of the start of the winter initiation season next month. Health practitioners and traditional houses and other stakeholders met yesterday to discuss the way forward. Traditional leaders said they could tackle the high number of deaths with the help of residents, parents and the boys themselves. The forum blamed government for not closing illegal initiation schools. Forum chairman Chief Gcobani Tyali urged elders to protect initiates attending the schools.Tyali said the main cause of death in previous years had been dehydration because the boys had lacked understanding.&ldquo;Most believe drinking water is not right for them and end up dying,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Water is always available at the schools. &ldquo;We always advise them to drink water, but they choose otherwise.&rdquo; The Eastern Cape Customary Male Initiation Practice Act states that only boys aged 18 and above should be circumcised.Anyone conducting initiation or opening a school without written permission from a health MEC and written approval from the relevant traditional leadership is guilty of an offence and is liable to a fine, 12 months in jail or both.&ldquo;If opening such an illegal initiation school results in the injury or death of initiates, such a person shall be charged with attempted murder or murder,&rdquo; said Tyali. &ldquo;Parents who sign up underage boys will be prosecuted. &ldquo;And so will illegal surgeons. &ldquo;Initiates have a responsibility to look after themselves. &ldquo;Drinking water is advisable.&rdquo;
