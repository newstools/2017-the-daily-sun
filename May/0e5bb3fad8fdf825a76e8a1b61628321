RESIDENTS of Mahube Valley in Mamelodi East, Tshwane said they have had enough of izinyoka connections in their area. They barricaded Solomon Mahlangu Road with trees and garbage on Friday.Residents demanded that shacks in the neighbouring squatter camp be removed.They claimed that their utility bill increases were caused by illegal connections by shack dwellers and that crime had increased since the squatter camp appeared.They threatened that if the shacks were not removed they would evict the people themselves.One resident, Lehlogonolo Kgobela (36), said most of the occupants in the unwanted area were foreigners. &ldquo;They connect water and electricity illegally from our properties.&rdquo; Cullinan police spokeswoman Connie Moganedi said the police were there to monitor the situation.She said crime could not be blamed only on the shack residents: &ldquo;There are people who also have to take responsibility. We cannot point fingers at one group.&rdquo; Tshwane Metro&rsquo;s MMC for housing and human settlements, Mandla Nkomo, said residents&rsquo; action was understandable because they paid for their expensive properties.He said there was an eviction attempt last year.&ldquo;The attempt was around May and it was stopped because municipal elections were about to take place.&rdquo;Nkomo said eviction should now take place because there was an eviction order.He said, however, he still needed to have a joint operation meeting with the relevant stakeholders today because some of the land belongs to the municipality and some to a private owner.
