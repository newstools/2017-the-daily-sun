ABOUT 300 angry residents stormed the kasi cop shop demanding answers about children who have allegedly gone missing after being kidnapped. And when they didn&rsquo;t get the answers they were looking for they smashed up the cop vans.Station commander of the police station in Bekkersdal, Westonaria, Colonel Abraham Nkwashu, faced the people who carried stones and sang revolutionary songs.&ldquo;I am also a parent. I will not allow children&rsquo;s lives to be endangered,&rdquo; said Nkwashu. But the people, some as young as 15 years, threatened to set him on fire. &ldquo;What has happened to the children? We are here to seek protection,&rdquo; they shouted at the station commander.A police van was stoned and cops were seen running for their lives.Leader of the Concerned Residents of Informal Settlements, Sipho Mabuza (36) said he led the march.&ldquo;There were two women who wanted to raise the matter of the kidnapped kids but the station commander ignored us,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Kids, especially girls, are being kidnapped by people in cars in Bekkersdal and Simunye near the RDP houses in Westonaria. But not one case has been opened.&rdquo;According to Nkwashu, about seven police vans were vandalised and some cops suffered minor injuries.Police used rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.&ldquo;The crowd was huge. We could not control them. We called for back-up from neighbouring police stations.&rdquo;He said no arrests have been made.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re investigating and will give this our full attention,&rdquo; said Nkwashu.He said stories about the kidnappings were only rumours.
