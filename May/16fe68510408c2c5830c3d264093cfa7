Dear MizzBI&rsquo;ve been dating my boyfriend for four months and decided to take our relationship to the next level.I slept with him, hoping to strengthen our relationship, but the very same day we were intimate I found out that he has been cheating on me.I was so angry that before I could think twice, I slapped him across the face. I walked away feeling hurt and used. What hurts the most is that he didn&rsquo;t even bother to apologise or explain himself.But I love him deeply and I want him back. My friends keep telling me to get over him because he doesn&rsquo;t deserve me.I was honest and faithful to him but now I just don&rsquo;t know what to do anymore. I need your advice.- MphoHi MphoI can only imagine the disappointment you feel. It seems he is not making any effort to humble himself and apologise.You will only have yourself to blame if you choose to continue dating him. If he really cares about you, he would have apologised or tried to explain himself. You say you want him back, but does he feel the same way? You will only find out if you talk to him about his behaviour and how you feel.
