ROBSON Rendani (48) said he has been scarred emotionally and physically by his boss.&nbsp; The man from Orange Farm, south of Joburg, said he can no longer provide for his wife and five kids because of injuries he sustained after an alleged assault by his boss and the man&rsquo;s cousins.&nbsp;Robson said he was employed as a delivery driver for Afja Trading in Midrand.&nbsp; &ldquo;In January, I was on my way to deliver products to Soweto. I was stopped by four armed men at Crown Mines, Joburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;They pointed a gun at my head and opened the back of the van. I was terrified and did everything that was asked of me,&rdquo; said Robson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The men then proceeded to rob the truck of all the products it was carrying.&nbsp; &ldquo;I decided to go back to the company to tell them what had happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when Robson explained the story to his boss, the man accused him of being part of the robbery and of arranging the whole thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boss called three of his cousins and they locked me up in a room where they began brutally beating me up,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;They broke my leg. To make things worse, I was immediately fired.&nbsp; &ldquo;My knee is now broken and I can&rsquo;t get a job anywhere.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to go for a knee operation which is going to cost thousands, which I don&rsquo;t even have.&rdquo;&nbsp; Daily Sun contacted Arifan Mayi, the owner of Afja trading, who said: &ldquo;This man is making up false allegations. He had an injury before he even started working for the company, when he was involved in an accident.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we did not fire him &ndash; he resigned. We even have the resignation letter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not pay that man a cent. We can rather go to court.&rdquo;&nbsp; SAPS spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa confirmed that a case of assault had been opened and said police were investigating the matter.
