YESTERDAY Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba came out strongly against a plan by former Jozi@Work beneficiaries to trash areas in the CBD.According to Mashaba, allegations that the city promised them permanent employment are not true.Mashaba said it had come to his attention that the Joburg Social Movement, representing the beneficiaries, is allegedly planning to create a big stink in areas such as Hillbrow, Joubert Park, the Central Business District and Braamfontein next Saturday night.&ldquo;This is set to follow the expiration date of three-month Pikitup contracts signed by former beneficiaries through the city&rsquo;s expanded public works programme,&rdquo; he said.According to Mashaba, the movement mobilised former beneficiaries and bused in others to trash the inner city in March, demanding permanent jobs.He said the programme was like a wolf in a sheep&rsquo;s clothing, because it resulted in middlemen being awarded multimillion-rand contracts to run projects.&ldquo;Our new approach to temporary work opportunities in the city will ensure that residents have fair and equal access to jobs on a rotational basis. &ldquo;Residents will be given these work opportunities directly through the city, and not through middlemen, thereby increasing the number of people who can fairly benefit from these work opportunities.&ldquo;I have met officials from Pikitup, who told me that cleaning services in the inner city might be compromised if the movement continues with their plans.&rdquo;Mashaba said those planning to illegally trash the city will face the full might of the law.
