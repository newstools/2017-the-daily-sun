THESE young pupils are fed up!On Wednesday, they rolled up their sleeves and removed stones from the road.The stones were left on Monday during a service delivery protest in Toekomsrus near Randfontein, Gauteng.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why the adults block the road, because we also have a right to use it. &ldquo;When I grow up I want to be a doctor. &ldquo;Now the protesters are trying to stop me from realising my dream,&rdquo; said a 12-year-old grade 5 pupil in the area.Randfontein chief traffic officer Kenny Mampondo told Daily Sun: &ldquo;What is good is that the kids saw us clearing the busy R28 leading to Joburg and they just joined in.&ldquo;We had to ensure they were safe as they helped to clear the road.&ldquo;It was nice to hear kids say the violent protest are damaging the roads.&ldquo;We had a discussion with them, and we all agreed that damaged roads cause potholes and ultimately lead to accidents.&rdquo;
