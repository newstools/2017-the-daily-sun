A CLEVER little girl (6) was worried about her two young friends, so she raised the alarm.&nbsp; Residents of K section in KwaMashu, north of Durban are calling the child a hero, because when a young woman took away her friends, she was quick to run to her mum and tell her what had happened.&nbsp; The mum told Daily Sun after her daughter told her about the incident, they began searching for the woman and the children, a 10-year-old boy and an 11-year-old girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;A neighbour said he&rsquo;d seen a woman with two children. We went there and found her and the children.&rdquo;&nbsp; The kids said the woman came on Tuesday and took pictures with them. On Wednesday, she offered them popcorn and on Friday, she told them to go with her because she wanted to buy them takkies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two kids went with the woman but my child raised the alarm,&rdquo; said the mum.&nbsp; After the woman returned to the section, she told angry residents she was from a hostel in KwaMashu and was sent by a woman to steal the kids.&nbsp; Residents wanted to beat her up but cops saved her.&nbsp; The rescued boy&rsquo;s mum said they didn&rsquo;t open a case because cops told them the children were safe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unhappy she was not arrested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear she&rsquo;ll come back. I think she is working for someone who sent her to steal our children.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said her son has not left the house since the frightening experience.&nbsp; Captain Nqobile Gwala said the woman was taken away for her own safety.&nbsp; &ldquo;The parents didn&rsquo;t open a case.&rdquo;
