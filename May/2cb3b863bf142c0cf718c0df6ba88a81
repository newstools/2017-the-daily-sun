MOSES MBELE always wanted his children to be proud of him, even though he could not provide much for them.Little did he know that one day he would be their hero and lifesaver!The 47-year-old used his body to save his daughters as their brick house came crashing down.It happened at Majemantsho Village in Mafikeng, North West, over the weekend while the whole family was asleep.Moses told Daily Sun he had been fearing the day their house would come down on them for a long time. &ldquo;I always knew this was going to happen. &ldquo;I was sleeping when I heard the roof shaking. The wind outside was blowing very strongly.&ldquo;All I thought of were my children, who were sleeping not far from me. I jumped up and grabbed them while they were still asleep and rushed for the door. But before I knew it, the roof was on my head and the bricks hit me hard.&ldquo;I knew I had to stay strong for my children,&rdquo; said Moses, who then put his body between his kids and the falling bricks even though the pain was great.When the dust settled he managed to get them all out of the rubble safely. &ldquo;I thank God for giving me the strength to do what I did,&rdquo;he said.Residents were overwhelmed by the quick-thinking dad&rsquo;s courage and they promised to help him rebuild his house.Moses said if he had a proper house none of this would have happened. &ldquo;I applied for a house over 10 years ago, but to date I have nothing. I had no choice but to live in this house I built myself.&rdquo;
