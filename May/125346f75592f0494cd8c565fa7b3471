STEVE Komphela is living in a dream world!And Komphela must be careful that his &ldquo;la-la land&rdquo; does not infuriate Kaizer Chiefs&rsquo; diehard fans, who have fallen deeper into a state of despair after their 1-1 draw with Golden Arrows. Saturday&rsquo;s draw comes hot on the heels of their 2-2 draw with SuperSport United.The similarity between the Arrows and SuperSport draws is that Amakhosi goalkeepers Itumeleng Khune and Bruce Bvuma conceded the equaliser in the last seconds of their respective matches.But Komphela believes Chiefs still have a strong possibility of winning the 2016-17 PSL title.Well, mathematically YES, but realistically NO!The worst part about Komphela&rsquo;s dream is that other title chasers &ndash; Bidvest Wits, Cape Town City and Mamelodi Sundowns &ndash; must lose all their remaining matches and the Amakhosi lads would have to win their three remaining games to finish the season on 56 points.But at the rate which Amakhosi are going, this looks more like the type of fantasy that doesn&rsquo;t even play out in horror movies.Following the shock 94th minute goal by Knox Mutizwa, which cancelled out Ryan Moon&rsquo;s 77th minute opener, Komphela could not be convinced of the clear possibility that their dream of winning a trophy this season is all but shattered. This would then be the second successive season Chiefs fans won&rsquo;t have any silverware in their trophy cabinet. Said Komphela: &ldquo;We messed up today and will take the next three matches (seriously). Mathematically yes, we still have a chance, we have to keep fighting for it. &ldquo;But when you look back at how many matches we have gone on like this (dropping points). . . It&rsquo;s unfair to the supporters and everybody else who want to see us get points.&rdquo;Added the coach: &ldquo;I am very disappointed. It&rsquo;s not the first time we conceded late &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how many setbacks like this we&rsquo;ve suffered. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t learn from these mistakes, but each time it happens you ask yourself why does it happen so often? There was no reason for us not to manage a victory. Four minutes (of added time) was gone and it was the last kick &ndash; it was so unfortunate we conceded again. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know when we will do better &ndash; the matches we are supposed to win, we are giving away.&rdquo;Komphela stressed that conceding late was unfair to the fans: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been fair to our supporters in a sense that moments like these erase everything else they see throughout the match. It&rsquo;s sad. But we must acknowledge that Arrows had a good game. They are quick, could have caught us in the first half and Itu (Khune) kept us in the game.&rdquo; Arrows coach Clinton Larsen praised his youthful side for giving Chiefs a tough time.He said: &ldquo;I think Chiefs controlled the game. But we could have gone into the break with the lead had we taken the chances we created. Our right full-back (Romario Dlamini) is 19 years old and made his fifth appearance. He never even played in the ABC Motsepe League, he comes from the Castle Regional League. It&rsquo;s nice to see youngsters come through and do so well for us. &ldquo;I feel for Steve because I&rsquo;ve also conceded late goals and know what it feels like.&rdquo;
