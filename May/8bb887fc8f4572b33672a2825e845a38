UNITED we stand and united we will succeed! That is the motto adopted by new Bafana Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter, who was introduced to the media by SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan at Safa House yesterday.Baxter, who has signed a long-term five-year deal with the association, stressed the need to get the country behind Bafana.He said unity was key: &ldquo;As a country we need to be united. I have ambitions of turning Bafana into a powerhouse in Africa and I can only do that if we get the PSL, clubs, players, the media and supporters to unite behind a common strategy and make Bafana not just a powerhouse on the continent, but a success in world football as well.&ldquo;My ambition is to unite the SA football family behind development of the game. We all have to buy into this.&rdquo;This is Baxter&rsquo;s second stint with Bafana: &ldquo;When I came to SA in 2004 I knew little about the country and there was a lot of negativity around my appointment. Even now there has been negativity when my name was mentioned as Bafana coach. &ldquo;However, I earned respect from my success with Kaizer Chiefs (two league and cup doubles in three years) and with SuperSport United (Nedbank Cup), and I&rsquo;m ready for this challenge.&rdquo;Baxter will meet with PSL club coaches in a bid to reach common ground.&ldquo;The reason I took this job is because I have faith in the talent here and in my ability to get the best out of the talent we have. I see a bright future if we all pull together as a country.&rdquo;He will be thrown in at the deep end on 10 June when he takes charge of Bafana for the first time for their opening 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifier away to Nigeria in Uyo: &ldquo;I have embraced this challenge. It&rsquo;s what I live for. I hope to surprise Nigeria.&rdquo;Baxter said there would be criteria for selection: &ldquo;To have criteria is very important.&rdquo; And he would not be fielding players over 35, as that would not be developing players for the future: &ldquo;I may use an older player for a one-off game but not regularly.&rdquo; The coach said: &ldquo;I have short and long term goals. The short term is to win games and tournaments, long term is Vision 2020, which is one of the reasons I took the job &ndash; development.&rdquo;He said he had not made any decision on assistant coach Owen Da Gama, who served under previous coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba: &ldquo;I will be naming my squad and technical team for Nigeria (in 10 days) but I won&rsquo;t be making a lot of changes, as I know most of the people involved.&rdquo;The coach will also travel to watch European based players.Jordaan said Baxter&rsquo;s appointment was unanimous and his mandate simple: &ldquo;He has to win games.&rdquo;He added that after the extensive search for a new coach &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got the right man for the job&rdquo;.
