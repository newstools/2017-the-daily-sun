Rich people's salaries decreased by between 15% and 30% from 2011.Income per person in Group 7 is estimated to have been R960,000 in 2016, down from R1.2 million in 2011 in real terms. Income per person in Group 8 is estimated at R4.53 million in 2016, down from R6.53 million in 2011 in real terms.The report said: &ldquo;The pace of income growth in these segments has not kept up with the pace of migration of the population, from lower income groups into affluent groups. Notwithstanding, the affluent segment still enjoys very high buying power,&rdquo; The Standard Bank Consumer Trends Report: 2016 uses data from the Bureau of Market Research (BMR), and was compiled by economists, Siphamandla Mkhwanazi and Kim Silberman. The report noted that since 2011, per capita income for the lowest income group has risen by 19% in real terms, from a low base of R807 to R989 per year. &ldquo;The average income in this income group is subdued by the high number of people with no sources of income in SA, estimated to have been 41% of the adult population in 2016.&rdquo;This group accounts for approximately 50% of total adult population.In the middle segment (Groups 3-5), income per person declined by an average 4.5% in real terms between 2011 and 2016, despite very little growth in the size of the segment.The decline in income levels in these segments is primarily due to income growth that has not kept up with inflation, the report said.In 2016 Inflation was 6.3%, therefore, real growth in personal income in 2016 averaged 0.2%, which is not in line with household spending, the report said.Standard Bank said that from BMR data it appears that government&rsquo;s fiscal policy, which redistributes wealth and income via social grants as well as an increase in public sector employment via the expanded public works and other programmes, has made some progress with respect to reducing income inequality.
