THE argument between maskandi stars Khuzani Mpungose and Mthandeni Manqele has spread to their fans. The musicians from KZN blame each other for a fight at Nqokotho Music Festival. This was at Curries Fountain Stadium in Durban on Saturday, and it left two fans dead. Apparently there was a scuffle in the crowd and shots were fired. People believe the incident was related to the beef between the musicians. Following the tragic incident, Mthandeni took to his Facebook page to complain about the incident, which happened while he was performing.But Khuzani told Daily Sun Mthandeni had no right to complain as he was the one who started the beef. &ldquo;I was in the music business before him but he always throws shade over me.&ldquo;He always curses me in his songs.&rdquo; Khuzani said if his rival had proof that his fans were behind the incident, he should go to the police. &ldquo;The cops made it clear that if there is anyone who has information about the people who died, they should be contacted.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed Mthandeni hasn&rsquo;t gone to the police as he claims to know the killers.&rdquo; Khuzani said he wanted to make peace with Mthandeni because their beef was no good for fans. &ldquo;I personally don&rsquo;t want to be part of this hate anymore.&ldquo;I have gone to community radio stations asking them to stop playing songs promoting the hate.&rdquo; When contacted for comment, an irritated Mthandeni said he refused to comment on anything connecting him with Khuzani. &ldquo;He can call me directly if there is anything he wants to say to me.&rdquo; Mthandeni&rsquo;s manager, Vusi Leeuw, said he couldn&rsquo;t comment on the issue as he had only recently found out about the feud between the two.
