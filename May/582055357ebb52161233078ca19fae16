THE queen of gqom is upset about not being the fairest of them all in Mzansi music&rsquo;s Lala Land.&nbsp;According to insiders, Babes Wodumo has threatened to boycott local music awards&rsquo; ceremonies if she&rsquo;s not honoured with an accolade &ndash; recognising her blood, sweat and tears.Said the first source about the singer (real name Bongekile Simelane) from Durban, KwaZulu-Natal: &ldquo;Babes was robbed at the Metro FM Music Awards earlier this year. Not only has she worked very hard, but her super popular song, Wololo, was a mega hit.&ldquo;Anyhow, she feels she should&rsquo;ve won, at the very least, one award because her song was a success.&rdquo;Babes Wodumo was nominated for four Metro FM Awards, but she allegedly never secured enough votes to walk away with a prize.Another source said the 24-year-old was keeping a &ldquo;close eye&rdquo; on the upcoming South African Music Awards (Samas) &ldquo;to see if she&rsquo;d been overlooked again&rdquo;.&ldquo;Make no mistake here, she has no plans to quit music whatsoever,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;But she has hinted at never taking part or performing at these events because they have, so far, been unfair to her. And the whole of Mzansi knows and feels the same way. Ask anyone.&rdquo;A third source said it would be nice if the Samas actually awarded &ldquo;deserving artists, for once&rdquo;.According to the mole: &ldquo;Babes has fans and they did vote for her. For instance, her video for Wololo reached a million views within a month after being released.&rdquo;In her comment, Babes said: &ldquo;People know I was robbed at the Metros. It&rsquo;s strange how people who don&rsquo;t have songs won awards. To be honest, no song was bigger than Wololo.&nbsp;&ldquo;If the Samas do the same thing as the Metros, I won&rsquo;t attend awards shows. That would be best for my sanity. I&rsquo;m not being cocky, but numbers don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;&nbsp;Samas publicist Hloni Modise said she was not allowed to comment on the matter and referred all inquiries to the CEO of the Recording Industry of South Africa, Nhlanhla Sibisi, who was not available for comment.
