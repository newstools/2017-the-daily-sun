WHEN thugs broke into the Mokoenas&rsquo; house on Sunday, one of them dropped his hat. On Tuesday, the family gave the hat to a sangoma, who put muthi on it. And now the thugs have been warned that they have seven days to confess or they will be cursed! The Mokoenas from Duduza, Ekurhuleni said they wanted to teach the thug who dropped his hat a lesson he would never forget. They want him to tell them where their belongings are and to promise never to steal again. The thugs stole a tablet, a wristwatch, laptop and two cellphones from the house. Dineo Mokoena (38) said: &ldquo;We want him to come and fetch his hat himself. We are tired of these thugs. We work hard and they just come and help themselves. &ldquo;We have decided to deal with this thing our own way. We are tired.&rdquo; Dineo said they placed the hat outside for the owner. When asked if the muthi would not harm an innocent person, she said it could only affect the owner. Constable Harry Manaka said a case of theft was opened at Duduza Police Station and cops were investigating.
