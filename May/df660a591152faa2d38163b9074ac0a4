God is good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die knowing that my four grandchildren and five daughters have a roof over their heads.&rdquo;Mashatile said: &ldquo;Our first priority is elderly people.&rdquo;He said the government had allocated and approved six big projects for Etwatwa and was processing 39 000 title deeds.&ldquo;Mega projects will include the building of RDPs, schools, flats, hospitals and vacant land owned by the private sector,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This will be used to build serviced stands in which people will build their own houses. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not building houses but new communities.&rdquo;He told the title deeds recipients: &ldquo;The government is giving you assets. Don&rsquo;t sell them.&rdquo;
