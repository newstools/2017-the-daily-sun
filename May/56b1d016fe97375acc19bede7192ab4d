Erick &lsquo;Tower&rsquo; Mathoho watched training from the sidelines on Tuesday morning owing to what David Milner described as, &ldquo;Tower suffered a concussion during the fixture against Platinum Stars last week.&rdquo; The Kaizer Chiefs defender was involved in a head collision with Stars&rsquo; Bonginkosi Ntuli during the first half of the match played in Phokeng last Wednesday, 17 May. &ldquo;We observed him after the collision,&rdquo; continued Milner. &ldquo;We gave him a few minutes in the second half but had to substitute him (55&rsquo;) as a precaution.&rdquo; Tower will miss Saturday&rsquo;s match against Bidvest Wits. The Glamour Boys will tackle the Clever Boys at FNB Stadium (Kick-off at 15:00). Still in the medical room, Sibusiso Khumalo limped off the field during Monday&rsquo;s training session. &ldquo;Sbu is still struggling with his knee injury,&rdquo; confirmed Milner. &ldquo;We will continue to assess him, but he will not take part in the Wits game on Saturday.&rdquo; Siyanda Xulu has joined the medical room after suffering a groin strain. The defender is therefore also ruled out of this Saturday&rsquo;s match. Brilliant Khuzwayo is involved in rehabilitation at the moment and he is making a steady recovery. &ldquo;We are happy with Khuzwayo&rsquo;s progress to full fitness,&rdquo; reported Milner. The goalkeeper is making a return from an ankle surgery.
