LIFE has allegedly been an uphill battle for former Orlando Pirates star Bennett Chenene (33).&nbsp;According to insiders, the midfielder has been club-hopping &ndash; seeking past glory.&nbsp;This in a bid to revive his faded career.&nbsp;So allegedly desperate had Chenene been, that reports surfaced last year suggesting he was conned out of R5&thinsp;000 by a football commentator who had promised to find him a spot with a prominent Absa Premiership team.&nbsp;The first source said he was keen on finding a good club because age was no longer on his side.&nbsp;Said the mole: &ldquo;His situation after what that commentator did to him is killing him.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s also under pressure because his family expects him to put food on the table, but luck has not been on his side.&nbsp;&ldquo;It seems he&rsquo;s unfortunately been knocking on wrong doors.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second source claimed Chenene&rsquo;s dry spell seemed far from over.&nbsp;&ldquo;He was expecting to clinch a deal in Thailand, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have gone well,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s stuck between a rock and a hard place, and time is no longer on his side.&rdquo;&nbsp;A third source claimed: &ldquo;Chenene said he would hang up his boots if he still hadn&rsquo;t got a chance to play by the end of July.&nbsp;&ldquo;He really doesn&rsquo;t deserve what is happening to him at this moment.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s depressed and it&rsquo;s not nice seeing him in such a state,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;Asked for comment, Chenene told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;That guy killed me, but at the moment I&rsquo;m just waiting for two offers from teams in Qatar and Slovenia in June, maybe life will be better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
