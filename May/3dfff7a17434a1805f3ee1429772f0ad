The whole Manchester city centre is under lockdown following a deadly bomb attack last night.Church of England Dean Rogers Govender told News24 today that the atmosphere around the Arena is unreal.The Islamic State group says one of its members planted bombs in the middle of crowds in Manchester, England where 22 people died in an explosion.People coming into the city were unable to get to work, with police officers walking around the entire area."Police are seen carrying guns, compared to South Africa, police here are not allowed to carry guns in public, unless something occurred &nbsp;it&rsquo;s bewildering and surreal." said Govender.Govender has been a dean in the city for about 11 years.He lives about three kilometers from the Manchester Arena, where 22 people were killed in a bomb attack at an Ariana Grande concert on last night.Govender &nbsp;says people are feeling rather confused and thinking to themselves 'Might this terrible attack occur again throughout the day?'.The Manchester Cathedral is around the corner from the Manchester Arena.Govender said congregants have not been allowed to enter the cathedral following the attack because it fell in the area which was under lockdown."We normally have prayers at 9am in the morning, but this morning we decided to just do prayers on street. It felt appropriate given the tragedy," he said.The international relations department said its consular services were in contact with the South African High Commission in London to help any South African citizens who may have been affected.President Jacob Zuma has condemned the bomb attack in Manchester, UK in which 22 people, most of them children, were killed.He extended his condolences to families who lost loved ones in the attack, saying violence and extremism were a threat to peace, security and development.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-condemns-deadly-manchester-suicide-attack-20170523@axios @mikeallen Death toll now at 29 mostly girls#Manchester https://t.co/SWMkWApojb&mdash; Facts Over Feelz (@AmericaFirst_X) May 23, 2017A 8 year old girl was killed in Manchester last night.
