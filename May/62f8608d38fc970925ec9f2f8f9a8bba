VETERAN runners Mapaseka Makhanya, Irvette van Zyl, Rene Kalmer and the Phalula twins Lebo and Lebogang always dominated the Spar Women&rsquo;s 10km Grand Prix races. But the winds of change are blowing in the popular women&rsquo;s road running event. There is new blood threatening Makhanya and company&rsquo;s dominance this year. The Grand Prix consists of six races ran in six cities &ndash; Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Pretoria and Joburg &ndash; and the overall winner on points bags R150 000. Kesa Molotsane made the veterans sit up and take notice in the first two races. Molotsane, who specialises in track and field in the 1 500m and 5 000m events, has made a dream debut in the series. The 25-year-old finished second in the first race in Cape Town last month and made an even bigger splash in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Molotsane won the race in 33 minutes and 13 seconds. A visibly disappointed Van Zyl registered 33:21 to take second place, with Makhanya claiming third with 33:40. Molotsane had overtaken a tired Van Zyl with 2km to go to claim top spot on the podium. The athlete, who runs in the colours of KMPG, is a slow starter but recovered well to overtake a gutted Van Zyl, who had led from the first kilometre and at one stage had a comfortable lead of 200m. Makhanya, who tipped Molotsane as favourite to win this year&rsquo;s title, welcomed the new rival: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy there is new blood coming through. It shows there is talent in SA.&rdquo;Molotsane, who works as sports assistant at the University of Free State was overjoyed with her triumph: &ldquo;I beat Van Zyl in Cape Town and to do it again is an amazing feeling.&rdquo;
