WHEN people saw a truck offloading cement and building materials next to the unfinished construction site, they were happy.Residents of KwaMashu&rsquo;s N section breathed a sigh of relief because construction resumed on Thursday at the trench left open since last year.They felt the trench was very dangerous, especially for kids and drivers. Simphiwe Ngidi (46) told Daily Sun they lost hope that it would ever be finished. &ldquo;But last week we started seeing trucks offloading materials.&rdquo; When Daily Sun contacted construction manager Shaun Naidoo about why the construction had stopped, he said workers were being threatened. But after speaking to eThekwini Municipality, they&rsquo;ve gone back to work and things are quiet so far. &ldquo;Last year we were threatened by a group claiming to be Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association members.&rdquo; He said they demanded a 30% share of the project. &ldquo;We had to stop and report it. But since starting again, nothing bad&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;Councillor Simon Khuboni said he asked the construction firm to continue working. &ldquo;We never came across a group threatening workers. People are no longer worried about the open trench.&rdquo;
