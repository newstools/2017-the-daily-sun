SIX billion rand? Where did Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini get that figure from?This is what Mzansi has been left wondering after Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza today told MPs that he didn&rsquo;t know how Dlamini arrived at that amount.Dlamini told the portfolio committee on social development last week that Sassa needed R6 billion and five years to fully take over the scheme from Cash Payment Services (CPS), as ordered by the Constitutional Court. The court ruled in 2013 that the contract was illegal because of tender irregularities and ordered the minister to make alternative arrangements. Dlamini failed to do so and brought the country&rsquo;s grant payment system to the brink of disaster this year.Magwaza told the standing committee on public accounts: "As Sassa, we have not sat down to discuss what we need, and that's all I'm going to say about it." MPs wanted Magwaza to discuss the differences with the minister further, but committee chairperson Themba Godi shielded him from answering, saying it could make his work conditions impossible if he went against his political principal.Magwaza also said that the takeover of payments would only take a maximum of five years if there were hiccups. Otherwise, the process could take as little as two years. The SA Post Office is likely to have a role to play in this process, but the practical details of this have not yet been worked out.Magwaza stressed that current service provider CPS would definitely be phased out by the March 2018 deadline.Dlamini did herself no favours by ducking out of the meeting after thirty minutes to attend a Cabinet meeting. She has a terrible track record of either not pitching at all to account to Parliament, or of leaving important meetings early.MPs took issue with Dlamini for "ducking her responsibility" yet again, leaving Magwaza to account for her statements.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-dont-know-how-dlamini-got-her-r6bn-figure-sassa-ceo-20170516
