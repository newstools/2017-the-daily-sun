In fact, the growth of this sound will give more gqom producers exposure. The world is waiting, we should push this sound.&rdquo;Insiders said DJ Tira&rsquo;s labour of love was finally bearing fruit.Said the first source: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a great job of promoting local stuff overseas, and it&rsquo;s now paying off.&ldquo;In recent months, he was first invited to play at the Love Out Loud expo that took place in Berlin, Germany.&ldquo;But due to staggering demand from the showbiz industry in Germany, DJ Tira found himself playing at five nightclubs in one night.&rdquo;A second source said the DJ was happy about the opportunity to put Mzansi music on the international stage.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s excited and glad that pioneering local artists.
