SUPERSPORT United head coach Stuart Baxter will be doing title-chasing Cape Town City no favours when the sides clash in an Absa Premiership showdown at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm). Baxter stressed his leg-weary side would fight on all fronts until the end of the season.Matsatsantsa have been playing matches every three days and Baxter, who was appointed the new Bafana Bafana head coach last week, has had to take everything in his stride.The Scot has had little time to think about Bafana while trying to guide United to a respectable place in the top eight, win the Nedbank Cup and do well in the Caf Confederation Cup.Said Baxter: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a hectic schedule with games coming thick and fast, we&rsquo;re playing every three days. We&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of travelling in Africa and locally but that&rsquo;s no excuse. We have to compete in every competition and go as far as we can.&rdquo;Baxter said he would rotate the squad that scored a late 3-2 victory away over Polokwane City at the weekend.Said Baxter: &ldquo;That was a good win over Polokwane. We were down to 17 fit players for that game. I did not even have a full bench. But it is what it is and we have to embrace it. The players are fired up and know they have to get on with it. But I will have to bring in some fresh legs for City.&rdquo;Baxter said he was expecting a tight game against Eric Tinkler&rsquo;s Citizens: &ldquo;They beat us 2-1 in the Telkom Knockout final and we drew 1-1 in the first round of the league. I expect this game will be just as competitive and tight.&rdquo;City are third with 52 points and a win would see them leap-frog over Mamelodi Sundowns, who are on 54 points, into second place. United are fifth with 45 points and a win would see them overtake Baxter&rsquo;s old club, Kaizer Chiefs, who are fourth on 47 points.
