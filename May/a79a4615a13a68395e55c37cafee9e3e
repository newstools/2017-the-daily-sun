The woman in pink caught her man red-handed&nbsp; with a side chick inside a car. She then resorted to climbing on top of the car in trying to prevent the two from leaving. The man drove off anyway with the side-chick and her woman on top of the bonnet. It all happened at the famous Tsamaya Road in Mamelodi, Tshwane over the weekend.
