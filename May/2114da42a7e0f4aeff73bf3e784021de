A THEFT charge was laid against former president FW de Klerk at Joburg Central cop shop yesterday by Kenny Motsamai of the Azanian People&rsquo;s Liberation Army.Motsamai was released from jail recently. &ldquo;I want De Klerk to explain how he has managed to own 87% of land while I live in a small yard. Meanwhile, in Cape Town Black First Land First members opened charges against De Klerk and former minister Adriaan Vlok for crimes against black people. The party&rsquo;s Ncedisa Mpemnyama yesterday told Daily Sun: &ldquo;How can De Klerk lead us when he killed our people?&rdquo; Spokesman Lindsay Maasdorp said they will also lay racism complaints against De Klerk with the Human Rights Commission. Captain Frederick Van Wyk said: &ldquo;A complaint about it was reported at Cape Town Central SAPS today and we&rsquo;re looking into it.&rdquo;Spokeswoman Megan Dick said: &ldquo;The FW de Klerk Foundation is not concerned about Black First Land First. It has used a campaign to divide South Africans. The TRC couldn&rsquo;t link De Klerk to gross human rights violations.&rdquo;
