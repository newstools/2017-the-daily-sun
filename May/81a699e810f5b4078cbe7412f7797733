MAMELODI SUNDOWNS coach, Pitso Mosimane, is concerned that they no longer have control of the time they&rsquo;ll play their Caf Champions League matches.&nbsp;Mosimane reckons playing their fixtures at night, instead of during the day, will suit North African teams.The Brazilians used the heat factor to their advantage last season when they thrashed Egyptian giants Zamalek 3-0 in the first leg of Caf Champions League final.But Caf are now in charge of dates, time and venues for all their competitions.&nbsp;The reigning African champions will host Ethiopian side Saint George SC in their opening group stage match at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday.They will then meet AS Vita away on 23 May and then face Tunisian side Esperance on 2 June.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;Caf has given us the fixtures and they have taken over times and days to play. I like when they do that, but I want them to be consistent. The North African teams must also be told when to play.&rdquo;Mosimane hopes new Caf president, Ahmad Ahmad, will intervene to ensure fair play.Added Mosimane: &ldquo;I would like to play during the day.&rdquo;
