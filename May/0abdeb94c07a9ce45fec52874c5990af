ORLANDO Pirates have two matches to redeem themselves and rescue a disastrous Absa Premiership season.Bucs are in danger of failing to qualify for the top eight for the first time in history. They are ninth on 32 points, equal with Golden Arrows who have a better goal difference. Something is seriously wrong in the composition of the side &ndash; they have drawn seven and lost three of their last 12 league matches.New head coach Kjell Jonevret has a major job on his hands next season and will have to convince his management to bring in a host of new players, including a top quality striker, if they are to compete for silverware next season.Bucs play Ajax Cape Town at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday and finish their season against Arrows at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, in what could be a &ldquo;top eight cup final&rdquo;.Bucs lost to both title-chasing Bidvest Wits (1-0) and Mamelodi Sundowns last week, and on Wednesday played to a disappointing 0-0 draw away to relegation-haunted Bloemfontein Celtic. Fans were angry after the 2-0 loss at Orlando Stadium to defending champions Downs last Sunday and vented their anger at Downs fans outside the stadium.
