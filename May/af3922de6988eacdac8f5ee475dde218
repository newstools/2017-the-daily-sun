A Johannesburg man was shot and killed and his passengers robbed not far from the terminal at the OR Tambo International Airport.The driver was transporting six business people to the airport when a suspicious vehicle attempted to stop the Hyundai H1 they were travelling in.According to the police this happened &nbsp;as he took the off-ramp from the R24 highway to the airport.&nbsp;The vehicle was blocked by two other vehicles, one being a black VW Golf. The driver was shot and seriously wounded. In a video doing the rounds on social media, the man can be seen lying on the road, apparently dead. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee says it appears a gang of armed men driving the VW GTI opened fire with an AK-47, killing the driver.&nbsp; Abramjee says he raised this with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula recently."There are clearly gangs operating from the airport and following arrival passengers. Today they struck not far from the terminal building. It shows how shameless these gangs are." said Abramjee.The OR Tambo International Airport management said they were aware of the very unfortunate and deeply concerning matter and are waiting to get more information from police.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/man-shot-dead-at-or-tambo-international-20170515
