IN 2014 he told his supporters to take any unoccupied land they see. But his comments landed him in trouble with the law. Today, the firebrand EFF leader is again appearing in the Newcastle Magistrate's Court for his comments.The EFF has always said that the charges against Malema were a waste of time, and an attempt to distract the party from its political programme.The outspoken Malema is known for making radical statements on land issues.In 2016 Malema was charged two times for contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act over comments he made to supporters in Newcastle and Bloemfontein. He has since been charged under common law for the same matter, in which he will be on trial in July.The EFF leader in 2014 told supporters that they should occupy unoccupied land because they needed the land in order to eat and work.&ldquo;If there is unoccupied land, we will go and occupy the land&hellip; you must go and do the same,&rdquo; said Malema to EFF supporters.In June 2016, while at a rally marking the 61st anniversary of the Freedom Charter, Malema said whites could not claim ownership of land in South Africa because it belonged to the African majority.He has also continued in that vein, even after being charged in November 2016. He is also challenging the constitutionality of the apartheid era law in the High Court.&ldquo;His matter is likely to be postponed to a latter part of the year,&rdquo; said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku.The matter had to wait for Malema&rsquo;s constitutional court challenge to be completed, Mfaku said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/malema-case-likely-to-be-postponed-npa-20170505
