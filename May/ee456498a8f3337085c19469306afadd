RESIDENTS claim snakes have invaded their village. Residents from Gwamama Village in Estcourt, KZN told Daily Sun that they are terrified of the cobras and green mambas that have allegedly been eating their chickens, goats and even puppies. They said they started seeing these snakes in 2013 but at the time they didn&rsquo;t cause much damage because the mlungus who lived in the area used to catch them. Sipho Khanyile (40) said no one knew what the mlungus did to get rid of the snakes. &ldquo;But ever since they left in 2015, the snakes have been feasting on our livestock. &ldquo;Most of all, we are afraid of them,&rdquo; he said. Sipho added that they feared the snakes would target them once there was no more livestock in the area. &ldquo;These snakes are big and scary. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t see them, but see by the marks they leave on the ground that they&rsquo;ve passed here.&rdquo; Another resident, Sindisiwe Dladla (36), said a snake ate her two chickens. &ldquo;The last snake we saw was on Saturday. It was beaten by residents.&rdquo; She said in January, another snake was shot and killed by a resident. &ldquo;When residents see the snakes they kill them to get rid of them,&rdquo; Sindisiwe said. But so far killing them had not helped because more just appear. &ldquo;We are appealing to the SPCA to come and take these snakes away from our area to save our livestock.&rdquo; SPCA spokeswoman Christine Kuch said: &ldquo;We will ask our colleagues at Estcourt to investigate the matter and assist.&rdquo;
