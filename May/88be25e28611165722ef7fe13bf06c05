THE piercing screams of two women crying for help last Monday night woke sleeping Herdman Mpalweni (48).His conscience refused to allow him to pull the blanket over his head and go back to sleep.&shy;Herdman, a self-employed deliveryman from Rondebult in Ekurhuleni, knew he had to fight for the helpless women.He grabbed his licensed gun and ran out of his RDP.He first fired a warning shot to scare off the three attackers.But it turned out that he had thrown himself in a lion&rsquo;s den. It was a battle zone. The thugs returned fire but Herdman refused to back off.One of the thugs was injured but the other two continued firing. &ldquo;I had to crawl on the ground to save myself from being killed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I was not going to give up.&rdquo;He sustained six gunshot wounds &ndash; and was still fighting for his life when the thugs ran away.Herdman limped to one of the houses to ask for help and was rushed to hospital.One of the thugs&rsquo; bullets is still stuck in his stomach.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going for an operation in June but I&rsquo;m happy that my ancestors saved me,&rdquo; he said.He said the two women ran for safety and he&rsquo;s still looking for them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know those women, and I wish I could meet them.&rdquo;Herdman said the investigating officer assigned to his case has not yet taken a statement from him.Constable Daphney Phoko, spokeswoman for Rondebult Police, said she&rsquo;s going to check with the investigating officer.
