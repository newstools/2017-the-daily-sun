EMOTIONAL fellow pupils, residents, teachers and members of community groups couldn&rsquo;t hold back their tears at the memorial service for nine-year-old Keketso Mahlakwana. The service was held yesterday at Saabirie Chishty Hall in Lenasia next to the Flamingo Primary School Keketso attended.Before the official service pupils filled the hall for moments of prayer and moved out as the official programme started.Keketso Mahlakwana was playing with friends outside his school last Tuesday when he was apparently taken by people in a white minibus taxi.Police launched an intensive search for him and the body was found in a field opposite the Lenasia Public Secondary School.Speaking at the memorial, a resident of Lenasia, Nicky Padiachy, said the passing of Keketso cut across racial lines. He said the tragedy had brought the community closer together.&ldquo;We stand before the family and ask the Almighty to guide them, soften their pain and protect them through these sad times,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We need to find the answers about why such things happened to such a young soul. Women are being targeted, violence is on the increase, and that needs to stop.&rdquo;Speaker Serenine Naidoo said: &ldquo;While the reasons for the murder are still not clear, what is clear is that we must condemn in the strongest possible terms the taking of a young life by merciless killers.&rdquo;Romina Padiachy said Keketso was the baby of the entire community.&ldquo;We mourn your loss. We feel your sadness,&rdquo; she told the family.Romina said the police had failed them.&ldquo;It is clear our law is too weak to address violence against women and children,&rdquo; she said.
