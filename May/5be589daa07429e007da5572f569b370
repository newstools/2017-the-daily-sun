Matatiele will be part of KZN again by the end of the year.The small town was moved to the Eastern Cape 12 years ago, but the decision was never fully accepted by residents.The African Independent Congress (AIC) has managed to reach an agreement with the ANC.Matatiele mayor Momelezi Mbedla on Monday assured residents that his council will support the ANC while the process unfolds.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe signed a memorandum of agreement two weeks ago with Mahlubanzima Jafta from the AIC, which officially set up political co-operation between the two parties.It&rsquo;s a huge victory for the party and its president Mandla Galo, who has been fighting for the reversal of the move to the Eastern Cape since 2008.Matatiele will be incorporated into the Harry Gwala District Municipality in KZN.There are plans to open an agricultural college in the town and to tar rural provincial roads in the area, particularly those connecting South Africa and Lesotho.The party&rsquo;s Wele Mdolomba said residents have long been ready to go back to KZN.&ldquo;The Eastern Cape capital, Bhisho, is very far from us. Service delivery moves slowly here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Another factor is that many of us work in KZN towns.&rdquo;
