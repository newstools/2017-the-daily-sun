Gauteng police this morning used teargas and stun grenades to separate protesters who were blocking several roads in Diepkloof, Soweto."The situation is very, very tense and is escalating to Zone 6. The road is blocked between Zone 6, Zone 5 and Zone 2," said Captain Kay Makhubele.Makhubele believes it is a service delivery protest, but said community leaders are yet to confirm their official concerns.Officers were trying to remove stones and burning tyres on the main road past the taxi rank to the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital."The traffic is still slow moving from that area. Elias Motsoaledi road and the Soweto Highway are open now."Makhubele said it was difficult to say how many people were involved as they were scattered and on the side of the road.He was following up on reports that the protest was moving in the direction of Pimville.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/teargas-stun-grenades-used-to-disperse-protesters-in-diepkloof-20170524#Diepkloof today its worse no one is going to schools or work Roads completely closed pic.twitter.com/6RH6xDSJQb&mdash; ??Uncle wa Renda ??
