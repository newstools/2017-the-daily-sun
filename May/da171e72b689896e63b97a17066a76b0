She called on the community to give the municipality an opportunity to investigate the incident and deal with it appropriately. &ldquo;I will keep them informed about developments,&rdquo; said Vosloo, adding that she would also meet the victims and ensure that they received support.THE SA National Civic Organisation (SANCO) says it's shocked by the video and called for the officers to be fired.&nbsp;SANCO says the shameful actions of the officers show disregard for human rights and the rule of law.According to SANCO spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu the officers humiliated the four suspects and displayed brutality that undermined their constitutional rights."They represent a calibre that has forgotten the pledge to serve and protect our communities," Mahlangu said.
