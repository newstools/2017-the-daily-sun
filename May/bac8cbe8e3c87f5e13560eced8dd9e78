The Democratic Alliance in Gauteng wants the African National Congress to fire the Emfuleni mayor for spending more than R1.7m on KFC, Nando's and expensive hotels.DA Gauteng constituency head in Emfuleni North Kingsol Chabalala, says this is in direct contrast to the challenges Emfuleni residents faced every day.Between November 2015 and April 2017, Mofokeng used up R629 000, Chabalala claimed.Chabalala said it is shameful that Mofokeng, a senior ANC leader continues to eat in the lap of luxury when so many in the municipality go hungry.Chabalala also disclosed that Mofokeng had used up R1.1m between 2011 and 2015, while he was still the mayor of the Sedibeng District Municipality.This was disclosed by Gauteng Co-operative Governance MEC Paul Mashatile, in a reply to a DA question in the legislature.Replying documents signed by Mashatile on Monday, which News24 has seen, show that Mofokeng had made personal claims amounting to R629 000 since he became the mayor of Emfuleni.Apart from Mofokeng's claims for luxury hotel stays and his appetite for fast food, strange fuel claims were also submitted for his private car despite him having an official mayoral vehicle, said Chabalala.The mayor says this is part of a sustained smear campaign emerging from the DA's miserable performance in the 2016 local government elections.Chabalala was a DA mayoral candidate in the 2016 local government elections.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/emfuleni-mayor-spends-fortune-on-kfc-and-nandos-while-residents-are-hungry-da-20170518
