A GAME between Kaizer Chiefs and Bloemfontein Celtic always produces fireworks.&nbsp;But now two of their stars, Pule Ekstein and Kabelo Mahlasela, have allegedly taken the rivalry to the bedroom.And currently their alleged scoreboard seems to show a drawn game: Pule Ekstein 1, Kabelo Mahlasela 1.This after the two players allegedly started doing &ldquo;girlfriend substitute&rdquo; in a bid to hit back at each other.Sunday Sun sources claim Kabelo was secretly dating Pule&rsquo;s girlfriend, Skeem Saam actress Amanda Manku.One source said Pule was so embarrassed and hurt that he promised to retaliate.And Pule allegedly hit back by playing &ldquo;hide the sausage&rdquo; with Kabelo&rsquo;s girlfriend.So said the source, who also claimed Pule sent an inbox to Kabelo&rsquo;s girlfriend Minnie Khumalo, requesting her numbers.&ldquo;After she supplied them, he hit it off with her,&rdquo; the soccer source claimed.&nbsp;Another source close to the situation claims that Amanda went to Pule&rsquo;s house and knocked on the door while he and Minnie were busy rattling the headboard.The source said: &ldquo;Amanda had access to the gate and the security guards knew her. She came and knocked non-stop, yelling things like: &lsquo;I know you&rsquo;re in there! Who&rsquo;s the bitch you&rsquo;re with?&rsquo;&rdquo;Another source alleged Pule denied seeing Amanda to Minnie.&ldquo;He said she was a crazy ex who won&rsquo;t let go. But we don&rsquo;t buy that story. We all know how boys operate &ndash; especially soccer players!&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll say anything to get into a girl&rsquo;s underwear. We told Minnie to be careful and just go with the flow &ndash; because she&rsquo;s competing with a celebrity in that guy,&rdquo; said the insider.When the SunTeam asked her about the allegations, Minnie refused to comment, saying: &ldquo;Why are you asking me about Pule? I&rsquo;m in class, I can&rsquo;t talk now!&rdquo;Kabelo also refused to comment. &ldquo;You guys are starting again, I won&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Kabelo.Pule hung up the phone when questioned about the allegations. Efforts to call him drew a blank as he ignored our calls.As for Amanda, she told the SunTeam: &ldquo;You know what &ndash; I&rsquo;m not going to comment on this.&rdquo;
