HENRI van Breda was emotional when his uncle saw him on the day his parents and brother were murdered, Andre du Toit testified in the Western Cape High Court today.Du Toit, Teresa van Breda&rsquo;s older brother, said when Henri (22) returned from the Stellenbosch detective&rsquo;s office with Marli&rsquo;s then-boyfriend James Reade-Jahn, James&rsquo; father Ron and Henri&rsquo;s friend, their reunion was emotional."We didn&rsquo;t talk a lot. We know when he speaks fast, he stutters. He speaks slowly. We hugged and cried," he told Judge Siraj Desai.He agreed that this was in contrast to the testimony of Dr Michelle van Zyl who later examined him and described Henri as calm.Henri is on trial on charges of murdering his parents Martin (54) and Teresa (55), and brother Rudi (22) with an axe, attempting to murder his younger sister Marli, and defeating the ends of justice.He has pleaded not guilty, claiming a balaclava-clad man attacked the family in their home in the De Zalze Estate, Stellenbosch, in the early hours of 27 January 2015, before escaping.Du Toit broke down when he told the court that he found out at the scene that Teresa, Martin and their son Rudi had died.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/henri-was-emotional-after-axe-murders-uncle-20170530
