MULTICHOICE Diski Challenge (MDC) coaches have wished South African Under-20 team the best of luck in the Fifa Youth World Cup tournament which will commence in South Korea tomorrow.THE SA Under-20 national team, also known as Amajita, will play their opening match of the World Cup on Sunday morning (10am SA time) against Japan at Suwon World Cup Stadium.The MDC coaches, Vusimuzi Vilakazi of Golden Arrows, Kwanele Kopo of SuperSport United and Vladislav Heric of Ajax Cape Town know most of the players very well as they were playing under their watchful eyes for different teams in the MDC.&nbsp;These coaches believe that the cream of crop that coach Amajita coach Thabo Senong selected is capable of doing greatly in the World Cup.&nbsp;However, these coaches say whatever results Amajita gets in the world showpiece, won&rsquo;t really matter because to be where they are today it&rsquo;s an achievement on its own.Said Kopo: &ldquo;We are very proud of these boys - qualifying on its own is something big. Now they need to go there do their best and enjoy themselves. It will be very foolish if we compare Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup.In Zambia, they did exceptionally well despite finishing fourth. This time around in the World stage it will be even tough for them but they are capable of making the country proud and we wish them well.&rdquo;This will be the third time Amajita play in the World Cup. The 2009 group made it to the last-16 of the competition.&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no doubt that the boys will want to excel in the tournament and some will use this opportunity to sell themselves as European scouts will be there monitoring the players.&nbsp;Vilakazi who is former Arrows player said: &ldquo;Coach Senong selected a good squad and to be honest this is the first time we have a strong Under-20 team.&nbsp;I believe these youngsters won&rsquo;t disappoint. We wish them well in their journey.Heric said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be disappointed by any results. It&rsquo;s a learning curve for the youngsters. Let&rsquo;s not put them under pressure.&rdquo;
