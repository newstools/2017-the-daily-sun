THE GOSPEL singer was on his way to church on Sunday when death came swooping close &ndash; a passing car knocked him over. Mack Thembalethu (38) was sent crashing headfirst into the pavement, the force of the impact leaving him injured and unconscious.But God had other plans &ndash; the gospel singer&rsquo;s Bible that had been sent flying in the accident, came down and smacked Mack in the face.And it was just in time! He was able to wake up and get his head out of the way just as another motorist came rushing towards him. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, Mack relived the scary accident on Paul Kruger Street, next to McDonald&rsquo;s in Pretoria West.&ldquo;I lost consciousness. I dreamt I was trapped and swimming inside a dark, burning pot. Inside the pot I saw my name on a list of people described as failures who were going nowhere in life instead of enjoying their success,&rdquo; Mack told Daily Sun.&ldquo;I was screaming inside the pot. But then I saw a lid hit me and got out of the pot.&rdquo; He said he thought he was going to join his friends from his teenage years, Sfiso Ncwane and Lundi Tyamara, to sing in heaven. They both died at the age of 38.Mack, known for his popular song Ndikhokhele Bawo, said the Bible brought him round and he managed to move his head away.In the end he only sustained a neck injury.&ldquo;I thank the good-hearted paramedics who picked up my Bible and put it safely in the ambulance.&ldquo;I was rushed to Steve Biko Academic Hospital and received treatment for my injured neck and bruised legs,&rdquo; Mack told Daily Sun. Warrant Officer Manie van Wyk, Pretoria West police spokesman, advised Mack to open a case so that a proper investigation could be done.Yesterday Mack told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to meet one of the pastors in Pretoria to pray for me.&ldquo;I want to praise the Lord and I will carry this Bible throughout my life.&ldquo;Indeed, this book is a life-saver.&rdquo;
