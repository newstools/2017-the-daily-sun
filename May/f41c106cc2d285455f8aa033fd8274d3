WHEN Lebogang Moletsane was invited to a baby shower by a friend on Wednesday, she never dreamed it would save her life. As the party was far away from Lebogang&rsquo;s home in Kliprivier squatter camp, near Protea Glen in Soweto, she decided to sleep over at her friend&rsquo;s house. At about 3am on Thursday morning, unknown people petrol bombed her shack and all her belongings went up in flames. Her neighbours tried to put out the fire but nothing could be saved. The 30-year-old lived with her boyfriend and their three-month-old baby in the shack. Luckily, her boyfriend wasn&rsquo;t home either. This is the latest in a string of attacks on the shacks of people who stayed in the area after residents of a neighbouring squatter camp were removed by the municipality. They apparently told those who were not removed that they must also move. Lebogang told Daily Sun: &ldquo;If it was not for that baby shower, I&rsquo;d be dead. These people are fighting us because they were moved. I don&rsquo;t know what they aim to achieve.&rdquo;Protea Glen police are investigating a case of arson.
