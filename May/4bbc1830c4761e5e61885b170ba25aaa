A NEWBORN baby was left next to Joe Slovo Drive in Berea, Joburg. Thanks to the quick response of community members, the baby boy was saved. A woman who was passing by heard cries from an open piece of land nearby and decided to go and check. She was shocked to find the abandoned baby wrapped in foil. It appeared as if he had been there for hours, if not the whole night, because by the time he was found he was very cold. ER24 paramedics were called to the scene. Spokesman Russel Meiring said the child was in a critical condition.&ldquo;Paramedics treated him and provided advanced life support intervention. &ldquo;The boy was then taken to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital for further treatment,&rdquo; said Meiring.In the meantime the newborn has been named Faith, and is expected to make a full recovery.Paramedics are appealing to the public to provide information that could help the police identify the mother.They are also appealing to the mother to come forward as she might also be in need of medical assistance. &ldquo;Please come to us &ndash; we will help you,&rdquo; said Meiring. The police have promised to launch an official investigation.Arrangements will be made to have the baby placed in care once he has been released from hospital.
