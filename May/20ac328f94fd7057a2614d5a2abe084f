DR PHOPHI Ramathuba said she believes some children get sick because of the food they are fed at creches. Ramathuba, the acting MEC for social development in Limpopo, said this yesterday during a summit held in Polokwane. She said some of the creches lack facilities and proper washrooms which endangers the health of the kids.&ldquo;We want to understand the challenges and see how we can help improve the standard in these creches. We need dietitians to help too.&rdquo; Ramuthuba said they would soon be doing surprise visits at creches to see how kids are treated. Daphney Ramokgopa, the head of department, said about 391 early child development facilities are still not registered with the department. She urged them to register so they can be regulated and to check if they comply. &ldquo;There are some registered facilities that also do not comply even though we fund them. &ldquo;An audit conducted by the department discovered that only 36% have clean running water on their sites. &ldquo;This shows that we still have a lot to do,&rdquo; said Ramokgopa.
