It was surrounded by a pile of clothes they believe were stolen!Nokuzola Kokodala (45) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the first time that we wake up to find a body in our kasi. We find bodies here every month&rsquo;s end.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of people killing thugs and dumping them here. We don&rsquo;t know this person or why they were dumped here. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything during the night. I only saw clothes and a body when I went to fetch water in the morning. I called neighbours, and cops came shortly afterwards.&rdquo; Another resident said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to see this body. These thugs don&rsquo;t listen. He obviously stole and was caught. People never learn. Petty thieves deserve to die.&rdquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut, a police spokesman, said: &ldquo;A murder is being investigated after the body of an unknown man was found with a gunshot wound in Sweet Homes.
