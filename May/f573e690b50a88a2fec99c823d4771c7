people had received the money on Friday, but he had not.Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla says they will
continue to work to support the fundraising efforts so that workers can receive
the additional R40 000.Pamla said they remain adamant that any company
that takes over operations at Lily Mine will need to prioritise the recovery of
the bodies of the trapped miners first.Cosatu has come out saying they want to see the
continuation of an investigation that will help determine the cause of the
accident and demand that those found responsible should be held accountable.Nkambule, Nyarenda and Mnisi were in a lamp room
housed in a shipping container on the surface of the coal mine, when an
underground supporting pillar collapsed on February 5, 2016. The container was buried under about 60m of rock
and soil, seventy miners were rescued using a ventilation shaft. Rescuers tried repeatedly to get to the three,
trapped underground, but had to withdraw as more ground collapsed.Mnisiâ€™s husband Shadrack lives in a house behind
the local spaza shop in Louieville, Mpumalanga.The father of two said the family had received
money from the Chamber of Mines, Old Mutual and some international churches.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/families-of-trapped-lily-mine-workers-each-paid-r200-000-cosatu-20170517
