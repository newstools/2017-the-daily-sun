DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane wants President Jacob Zuma questioned about emails which allegedly link him to the Gupta family.At a media briefing in parliament in Cape Town yesterday, Maimane said if the emails leaked at the weekend are authentic, they prove the state has been captured.He said: &ldquo;The DA believes Zuma&rsquo;s ANC government has given over control of our state to the Guptas. No one has ever voted for a Gupta, but the ANC has allowed them full control of our country.&rdquo; He said the state capture allegations warrant a full parliamentary inquiry.&ldquo;Parliament is mandated by the Constitution to hold the executive accountable. The DA has requested Speaker Baleka Mbete to establish an ad hoc committee to investigate the relations of captured ministers, the president and the Gupta family,&rdquo; said Maimane.Asked by the media what he would do if Mbete doesn&rsquo;t allow the inquiry to take place, Maimane vowed to take her to court. &ldquo;The fact that the ANC&rsquo;s National Executive Committee chooses to keep Zuma in power is a serious crime against the people of South Africa.&rdquo; He claimed that five ministers &ndash; Faith Muthambi, Mosebenzi Zwane, Des van Rooyen, Melusi Gigaba and Lynne Brown &ndash; are in the Gupta family&rsquo;s pocket.Maimane said his party is finalising documents to file a criminal case.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied that sufficient evidence exists for charges, including grand corruption, undermining state sovereignty and various statutory crimes carrying prison terms, to be laid.&rdquo; Maimane said the inquiry must have the power to summon the president to answer questions.
