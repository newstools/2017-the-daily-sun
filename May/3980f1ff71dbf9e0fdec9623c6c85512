KAIZER Chiefs midfielder George Lebese is allegedly a bedroom gymnastics gold medallist.Insiders said the footballer, who is rumoured to shoot anything but blanks, recently forced his alleged ex-girlfriend &ndash; Thato Mokoena from Dobsonville, Soweto &ndash; to have an abortion.Said the first source: &ldquo;We met George in October and it didn&rsquo;t take long before Thato and he hit it off. But around November, we found out she was double-dating George with SuperSport United player Morgan Gould. This was around the time Thato told us she was pregnant with George&rsquo;s child.&rdquo;Thato, however, says she has never even met George: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true. I have a son, plus I&rsquo;ve never met George.&rdquo;But a second mole said Thato desperately wanted to keep the baby, but George allegedly insisted that she terminate the pregnancy when he discovered Morgan was in the picture.&nbsp;Morgan denied the allegations: &ldquo;This is factually incorrect.&rdquo;George was not available to comment. Kaizer Chiefs spokesperson Vina Maphosa said he couldn&rsquo;t comment on personal matters of the players. He said he&rsquo;d liaise with the player who is in camp, but no one got back to us.&nbsp;
