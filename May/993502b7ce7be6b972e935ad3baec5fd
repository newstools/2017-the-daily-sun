HIGH-FLYING DJ Shimza and top-drawer celeb K Naomi have been caught in the ever-expanding web of gossip.&nbsp;According to the rumour mill, the TV presenter and model has found love &ldquo;in the gentle arms&rdquo; of the ones-and-twos maestro.&nbsp;Asked for comment on the alleged sizzling affair, a lukewarm K Naomi (real name Naomi Noinyane) said Shimza and her were no more than chums.&nbsp;Said K Naomi: &ldquo;You guys know that you are sabotaging my relationship, right? Because I&rsquo;m not dating him.&rdquo;&nbsp;Asked to name her prince charming, the star flat-out refused to comment.&nbsp;The SunTeam turned to DJ Shimza (real name Ashley Raphala) for his version of the story.&nbsp;&ldquo;Naomi and I are not dating. She supports my career and even comes to my shows &ndash; like everyone else who supports me. She&rsquo;s grown to be a very good friend because we&rsquo;re in a similar industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;But sources spotted them arriving together at several places in his G Wagon.&nbsp;DJ Shimza then embarked on an ambush marketing drive, pushing his upcoming tour.&nbsp;&ldquo;On a more positive note. I just signed with an international agency, based in Spain,&rdquo; DJ Shimza enthused.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only have I been touring the world, I&rsquo;ve also been anointed as one of the headliners in different international festivals.&rdquo;&nbsp;But the SunTeam&rsquo;s insiders poured cold water on the duo&rsquo;s denial, insisting there were sparks flying between the lovebirds.&nbsp;Said the first source: &ldquo;It was shocking to find out they were actually dating.&nbsp;&ldquo;They try so hard to hide it, but love just looks beautiful on them.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second source said: &ldquo;They want to keep this relationship discreet &ndash; because they don&rsquo;t want to be scrutinised.&nbsp;&ldquo;But why should they hide it? It&rsquo;s inspiring to see love in motion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
