It doesn’t matter that you bought them food and expensive gifts. You chose to do those things.”Malema’s comments come after the killing and kidnapping of women in Mzansi recently.He said: “Why don’t you kidnap politicians? You problem is the politicians, not the girl child.”Malema spoke about issues including xenophobia, capitalism, Somali spaza shops and land.He said Africans, especially those in Mzansi, must treat their fellow Africans with respect. “And when you’re successful, you must still treat others with respect!”Malema said Africans should give each other the best service.He said just because it’s black, doesn’t mean it’s cheap. He said the ANC gives township people bad service and people in suburbs the best. He lashed out at those who carry out xenophobic attacks.“When you chase foreigners, you never chase white people. When you chase foreigners, you never chase Indians or Chinese. You always go for the Africans because you suffer from self-hate.”Malema said spaza shop owners must refrain from attacking Somalis, adding that supermarkets took kasi business.
