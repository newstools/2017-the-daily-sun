IF you wouldn&rsquo;t call her fat, don&rsquo;t call her skinny either. Thin privilege is what you get when your body type happens to fit in with the current societal standards: people don&rsquo;t stare (for the wrong reasons) when you walk past, you never struggle to find a size that fits you in clothing stores and all you have to do to get what magazines call &ldquo;bikini-body-ready&rdquo; is put on a bikini. Ultimately, thin privilege means that although you hate your twiggy legs, society still prefers them. We live in a fatphobic society, where the mere thought of gaining a few kilograms has some people doing two-hour sessions on the treadmill as &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; for eating chocolate. Why? Because being fat in a world that hates fat will lead to discrimination, ridicule and ostracism. Fatphobia stems from the fact that we have all, at some point, considered fat to be synonymous with ugly and or lazy. Even the euphemism &ldquo;plus-sized&rdquo; indicates our reluctance to use the word &ldquo;fat&rdquo; because it has been used negatively &ndash; and is now considered a swearword. The word &ldquo;skinny&rdquo; also used to have negative connotations with its dictionary definition of &ldquo;unattractively thin&rdquo;, but these days, it&rsquo;s not approached with the same sensitivity. Understandably so, I guess. But recently, a new type of body shaming has gone unchecked. Skinny shaming is seen as unoffensive.It is important to understand why your wish to go up two dress sizes seems a little insignificant in the face of someone who has been denied employment because they are overweight. Skinny shaming is rooted in the notion that slender people have the bodies everyone desires, so how can they possibly be unhappy in that body shape? Look, there are different obstacles that come with each body type. There&rsquo;s always something we want to tweak a bit, nip or tuck. That&rsquo;s why we need to go easy on the weight comments &ndash; because we don&rsquo;t have the same body goals. And yes, skinny shaming sucks.&nbsp;
