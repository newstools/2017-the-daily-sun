FOR the first time in his life, Zukisa Leleki (36) thought he&rsquo;d finally found someone who truly loved him.&nbsp; He said after they met on Facebook, Noma Sakati called him every day to tell him that she loved him. He was convinced she cared about him, but he was wrong.&nbsp; &ldquo;She knew how to play her cards. In the beginning she pretended to be interested in becoming my girlfriend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then suddenly she needed me to help her with money,&rdquo; Zukisa told Daily Sun.&nbsp; He said Noma asked for transport money from Rustenburg, North West to meet him in Joburg.&nbsp; &ldquo;I transferred R345 to her in December last year, but then she came up with an excuse for why she couldn&rsquo;t comeIn January I sent money again but the same thing happened. During the Easter holidays she said she wanted to visit me but this time I was wiser and told her that I wouldn&rsquo;t be around,&rdquo; said Zukisa.&nbsp; He said last week Noma called again to ask him to lend her money.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told me she needed to renew her DStv subscription. I gave her money but she has since blocked my calls. I believe she is doing this to many other lonely men. Such a woman is dangerous, that&rsquo;s why I decided to warn other men who might be in a similar situation,&rdquo; said disappointed Zukisa.&nbsp; When the SunTeam contacted Noma, she first denied knowing Zukisa. When she was told about his allegations, she said: &ldquo;He was begging me to meet him. I took advantage of the situation. I owe him nothing and I did nothing to that loser.&rdquo;&nbsp;
