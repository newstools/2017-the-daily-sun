PLATINUM STARS won&rsquo;t only be fighting to win their opening Caf Confederation Cup group phase match when they host Algerian outfit, Mouloudia Club D&rsquo;Alger, at the Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace tonight (5pm), they will be battling fatigue too.&nbsp;Dikwena head coach, Cavin Johnson has hit out at the hectic schedule his players are experiencing and is worried about burnout.Said Johnson: &ldquo;We played Maritzburg United (in the Absa Premiership) away on Wednesday and had to fight for a 0-0 draw.&ldquo;On Sunday (today) we play in the Caf Confed Cup, then Wednesday we play Kaizer Chiefs in the league and next Saturday we play SuperSport United in our final league match.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough as we still have an outside chance of a top eight finish, so we can&rsquo;t relax.&rdquo;Sandwiched between Chiefs and SuperSport is a trip to Swaziland to play Mbabane Swallows on 23 May in their second Group B match. And after that, the Confed Cup continues in June.Added Johnson: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have no off-season and no pre-season. My biggest worry is not the short-term, but the long-term damage to players&rsquo; bodies.&rdquo;Mamelodi Sundowns, Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United have also suffered from playing in Africa.Downs coach, Pitso Mosimane, and Wits coach,Gavin Hunt, have been voicing similar complaints.Said the Dikwena coach: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how Pitso and Gavin manage. You can see the technique is gone when they play.&ldquo;They are struggling to get wins. There are simply too many games. I can complain until I&rsquo;m blue in the face but nothing will change.&rdquo;Johnson stressed his side would be going all out to beat their Algerian opponents.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a small team, with a big heart. I&rsquo;ve done my homework on them and managed to get DVDs of their last four matches and I have a good idea what we&rsquo;re up against.&ldquo;They have some decent players. Their best player is their captain and right back (Abderahmane Hachoud). I believe we can get off to a winning start,&rdquo; he said.
