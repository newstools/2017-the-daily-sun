HEALING people is one of his strong points. He said that&rsquo;s the reason he decided to became Rastafarian, because they believe in natural healing.&ldquo;I already knew at 15 that I wanted to follow the Rasta religion. Nothing has changed since then,&rdquo; said Vuyo Mthwa (23), a herbalist who works at Gugulethu Mall in Section 2, close to Cape Town. Mthwa is vegetarian. He said he can&rsquo;t stand the sight of meat.&ldquo;Sometimes it makes me feel like vomiting.&rdquo; The Rastaman does not wear ordinary clothes but dresses in sackcloth and walks barefoot.&ldquo;I am comfortable in what I wear.&rdquo;He said his family did not understand his calling at first but they support him now.&ldquo;Rastafarians don&rsquo;t like what some people are doing &ndash; selling our dreadlocks to other people. Stop selling our hair because our dreads are our pride and crowns.According to him, Rastas can date people who are not Rastafarian.&ldquo;We cannot change them to become Rastas because being a Rasta is a calling, not fashion. You cannot change a person&rsquo;s beliefs just because you are dating them,&rdquo; said Mthwa.He collects the roots and herbs he uses from the bush. He said he is able to protect people against evil spirits as well as healing the sick.&ldquo;The most popular of my herbs remains imphepho as it cleanses and protects people.&rdquo;
