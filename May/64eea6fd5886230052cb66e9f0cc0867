This comes after statements from Eskom about Thembisile’s disappearance had been issued and protesters decided to march to the substation.Eskom later issued a further statement saying her decomposing body was found locked in a storeroom.The statement said initially it was thought that she might have been hijacked but the Eskom car she used was found at the substation. At about 4pm on Monday, security officers arrived at the substation to wait for protesters and noticed a smell coming from a storeroom.“Initial indications are that she took her own life, which is extremely unfortunate,” read the Eskom statement. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said they are investigating Thembisile’s death.“Cops were called to the substation and taken to a room where a strange smell was coming from. “They broke down the door and the body was discovered. We do not know the cause of her death. We are waiting for the post mortem result,” he said.
