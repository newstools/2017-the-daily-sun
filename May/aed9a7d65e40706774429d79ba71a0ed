ADVOCATE Nazeer Cassim told the court yesterday Berning Ntlemeza knew that an order prevented him from going to work.&ldquo;The applicant is on full pay. His appeal is only two weeks away in the Supreme Court of Appeal,&rdquo; said Minister Fikile Mbalula&rsquo;s legal representative, speaking in the North Gauteng High Court.Cassim said the former Hawks boss wouldn&rsquo;t suffer any inconvenience if he stayed at home, pending his appeal.Ntlemeza is attempting to interdict Mbalula from blocking him from returning to work.Cassim said: &ldquo;What they are doing is coming here to score political points.&rdquo;He said Ntlemeza had failed to build a proper case.&ldquo;How can he say there is a degradation of his status if he is not at work?&rdquo;Several judges have found Ntlemeza to be dishonourable and unfit to hold office with regards to lying under oath.Cassim said Ntlemeza&rsquo;s application must fail, because as long as those judgments stand they have full effect until they are set aside.&ldquo;My minister is not heartless,&rdquo; said Cassim.&ldquo;If the real issue is a cellphone&sbquo; we can sort one out for him.&rdquo; Ntlemeza&rsquo;s lawyer Advocate Nceba Dukada said his client wanted Mbalula to stop making media statements, because they disturb him while preparing for his appeal and were humiliating. He said the court must deal with the matter urgently because it was linked to an urgent appeal in the Supreme Court of Appeal.&ldquo;Every day, every hour and every minute or second the applicant is out of work, the applicant is being prejudiced,&rdquo; said Dukada.Judge Sheila Mphahlele is expected to hand down her judgment today.
