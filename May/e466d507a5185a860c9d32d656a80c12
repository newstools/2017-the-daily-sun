WEEK after week their community was left in the dark as evil izinyoka kept stealing power cables.Then on Monday residents of Geluksdal, Ekurhuleni, came up with a solution: they were seen digging trenches to bury the dangerous cables and keep them out of the sight of izinyoka.Moipone Masango (45) said they would rather risk their lives, hiding the cables underground, than face another week in the dark.&ldquo;Every week cables are stolen. We trace the suspects and cops arrest them, but the next day they are out again, ready to steal from us. This is the best solution, even if we are putting our own lives in danger,&rdquo; said Moipone. The members of the community woke up early yesterday morning and started digging.Others took down the cables to bury them, while local women provided breakfast and tea for the hard-working men.Resident Paulous Mosehle (55) said last year izinyoka stole his cable three times. &ldquo;It took Eskom forever to replace them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love this initiative because our cables are going to be safe from these thugs.&rdquo;Eskom&rsquo;s national spokesman, Khulu Phasiwe, said: &ldquo;We do understand that the people are frustrated, but they must not take the law into their own hands. &ldquo;Officials will be dispatched to such areas to try to fix the matter.&rdquo;He said only qualified and authorised people are allowed to fiddle and tamper with electricity and to work with it in any way. &ldquo;Should anyone get hurt or die as result, Eskom and the municipality will not be held accountable.&ldquo;So the only way here is to report the matter so that it can be dealt with.&rdquo;
