MANDLA Magazi said he can&rsquo;t provide for his family any more.He claims he was fired because he is gay.The man (34) from Protea Glen in Soweto used to work at Fedics in Auckland Park, Joburg.&ldquo;Since I started working there last year, I was made fun of and called names such as Sis Bhuti and Chocolate Box. The workers said I was disgusting and sick,&rdquo; claimed Mandla. &ldquo;But I always remained professional and treated everyone with respect. I also did my job to the best of my ability.&rdquo; On 14 April, Mandla was allegedly told by his manager he was being fired because his sexuality was chasing away clients. &ldquo;I was told I was denting the company&rsquo;s name because I&rsquo;m gay. It&rsquo;s sad that there are people who still discriminate against others, even though we live in a democratic country.&rdquo;Royce van der Zwan, spokesman for Fedics, told Daily Sun Mandla&rsquo;s dismissal was performance based.&ldquo;I can confirm that Mandla was not fired because of his sexuality. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t disclose the reasons for his dismissal, but this is a professional company and we comply with labour laws. We followed all the right procedures and gave him the necessary warnings before he was fired.&rdquo;He said Mandla was called to an internal disciplinary hearing, where the decision was taken. &ldquo;He has appealed the decision, which we fully support, as he has every right to do so.&rdquo;
