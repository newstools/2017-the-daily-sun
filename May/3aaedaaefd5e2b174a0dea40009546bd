He said yesterday morning police found taxi men at the school gates. &ldquo;We understand they are allegedly from Mzamba and were there to support their home boys involved in Friday&rsquo;s fight.&ldquo;Chaos had erupted and the pupils torched an office and smashed classroom windows. &ldquo;A case of arson as well as two of assault were opened. &ldquo;No arrests have been made at this stage,&rdquo; he said.Mbizana mayor Daniswa Mafumbatha is reported to have arrived at the school with education department officials.Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said they were awaiting a full report on the incident from the district.&ldquo;We strongly condemn this approach of burning schools as it reverses communities&rsquo; gains in getting new schools. &ldquo;We will be monitoring the situation closely,&rdquo; said Mtima.
