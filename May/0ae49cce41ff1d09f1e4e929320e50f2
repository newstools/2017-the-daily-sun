POLICE watchdog, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, has demanded that the acting police commissioner stay away from any investigation involving its officers.In a letter of demand sent to Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane, Ipid alleges he used his position to illegally obtain documents related to their investigation against him. The letter demands that Phahlane should also ensure no police officers facing an Ipid investigation become involved in any counter-investigation into Ipid officials. The letter was sent by law firm Adams & Adams to the provincial commissioners for Gauteng and North West on 12 May. The law firm said it represents Ipid and two of its officers, Mandlakayise Mahlangu and Temane Binang.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss_DRV0lkM13okxi6ROL62XFyr2ojlFWOi0qfXfd7OfA5tvPqI42dWj56ublrmcth5GSMi6yVhm6DPeLHt_-GgOArQZvPe_ibRqUk-FTmoWEhBpQoMlKzQ9Avd7Yfhu4SWJiJ_afUeslHrjTq9Q9REAZRzqwb6R4etN-Bf_VxCeZII1G7w8hI2tFmD79v9AXXWwkeySklfHGe46J1oygha7hB0Kb8WuaqN3sW61iV_tT21JMhGHEL7lRoAGjFbnv9DYktoPDvR5IepUuJyfKFvdxx1XIzs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPH5qD7sMdtyEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
