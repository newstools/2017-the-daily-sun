FORMER TV and radio presenter Pushy Watson and her hubby Sean&rsquo;s marriage is allegedly on the rocks.&nbsp; Sources close to the couple claim that the two have been experiencing marital problems of late.&nbsp; One source alleges&nbsp;that due to the nature of their problems, Sean has moved out of their&nbsp;house.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has reliably learnt that Pushy confessed to her Rhema Church friends that things were no longer rosy at home.&nbsp; One church source said Pushy was hurt because she trusted Sean with her&nbsp;life and everything she had.&nbsp;&ldquo;She never thought this would come from one of the people she trusted the most,&rdquo; claimed the source.&nbsp; Another church friend told the People&rsquo;s Paper Pushy always held back her suspicions &ndash; until she found evidence and confronted Sean.&nbsp; The source alleged: &ldquo;Sean eventually confessed that an affair had been going on for a number of months.&nbsp; &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t believe this of the one person she had trusted with her life, the one person who was supposed to protect her.&rdquo;&nbsp; The source said Pushy&rsquo;s friends had been praying and trusting the Lord to give her strength and restore her dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s our leader and sometimes she encourages us to remain strong,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; A third source said Pushy was trying to pick up the pieces of her life.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s currently in a good space and her main focus is the ministry and her two adorable kids,&rdquo; the source told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&nbsp; According to this family friend, the couple has been living apart since March this year.&nbsp; &ldquo;He goes to the house to see his kids. Pushy is not bitter, just disappointed at the fact that this thing happened,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; The source said even though they are living separate lives now, there&rsquo;s room for reconciliation.&nbsp; When called for comment, Sean said: &ldquo;Who told you about all those things? I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the SunTeam asked to speak to Pushy, Sean said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at home at the moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yesterday, Pushy asked Sunday Sun to send her an SMS, but hadn&rsquo;t replied at the time of going to press.
