THE City of Cape Town will not allow people to grab land earmarked for other plans.Residents protested for three days after municipal cops destroyed several shacks in section 35 in Harare, Khayelitsha, close to Cape Town on Friday.But councillor Anda Ntsodo from Khayelitsha, a mayoral committee member, said: &ldquo;We sympathise with the plight of vulnerable residents, but we cannot allow people to invade land illegally. Such action prevents the delivery of infrastructure and workers&rsquo; access to underground services for maintenance purposes. Illegal shacks also get in the way of firebreaks.&ldquo;People occupied land where a school was supposed to be built. Now children do not have a school.&rdquo; Ntsodo said he would meet with ANC councillor Andile Lili over the land issue.Some people built shacks in section 35 four years ago and others as recently as three months ago.Resident Fumana Sobetwa said: &ldquo;It is really hard when you lose your house in winter. The municipal cops did not even give us a chance to remove our property &ndash; they just demolished our shacks!&rdquo;Another resident, Nomonde Njanike (55), said she had built her shack three years ago in the open space where thugs used to mug people.&ldquo;Since we put up shacks here the place is safe. People do not get robbed, but we are treated like criminals. We need land to build houses on,&rdquo; Nomonde said.The backyarders held a meeting with their local councillor, Anele Gabuza, on Saturday. He told them he would not allow land invasion.&ldquo;I do not own the land. It belongs to the city,&rdquo; he said.
