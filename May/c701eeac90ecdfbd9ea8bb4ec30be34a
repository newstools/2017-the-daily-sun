TWO STORIES of two unrelated women.&nbsp; But they are linked by fear and death.&nbsp; WHILE THE ONE LIVES IN FEAR, THE OTHER IS ALREADY DEAD.&nbsp; Stories make headlines, protesters wave banners, petitions are signed, but when all is said and done, women are still the victims of emotional and physical brutality, and death. One such victim is Nancy Oliphant (35) who lived with her parents at Orange Farm, south of Joburg. Nancy left her home on Saturday to go to the mall. She wasn&rsquo;t heard of again until her body was found under a bed in a house in Orange Farm. Speaking to Daily Sun, Nancy&rsquo;s mother Maureen Oliphant (58) said before her daughter left, she said she was meeting her boyfriend.&nbsp; &ldquo;As she was leaving she was on the phone to her boyfriend,&rdquo; said Maureen. &ldquo;Later during the day I became worried and phoned her boyfriend, but he didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;answer.&rdquo; The next day Nancy&rsquo;s uncle called and told the boyfriend to come to the house. &ldquo;He came to the house and told us he last saw her the day before,&rdquo; said Maureen. Nancy&rsquo;s aunt, Kobi Oliphant, said they later went to fetch the police and demanded the boyfriend come to the house for questioning. &ldquo;Cops took him to his house. He let the police search his house but said one bedroom door was stuck,&rdquo; said Kobi. &ldquo;Then he went outside and tried to escape but he was caught.&rdquo; According to Kobi he confessed after interrogation and told them to look under the bed in the closed room. &ldquo;Police found Nancy&rsquo;s body. Her hands were tied and her face was covered with a plastic bag. A hammer was found next to the body,&rdquo; said Kobi. Police spokesman Captain Keke Motsiri said a case of murder was opened. &ldquo;The suspect will appear in court soon,&rdquo; he said. While Nancy is no more, Phumza Lisa (37) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni is alive, but living in fear. &ldquo;I thought he was bluffing when he told me I would pay but I have learnt the hard way,&rdquo; said the mother of two. She claims her ex-boyfriend wants her back and has threatened to shoot her if she doesn&rsquo;t come back to him. She believes the angry ex-boyfriend came to her house on Friday and burnt her car. With the help of neighbours they managed to put out the flames. &ldquo;I guess this is what he was referring to when he said I&rsquo;d pay. It&rsquo;s winter now and my car is burnt. My kids will struggle and my business is affected.&rdquo; She said with the number of woman being killed, she fears for her life. &ldquo;I fear for my life now. I may have to pay with it.&rdquo; But the ex-boyfriend told the SunTeam he didn&rsquo;t threaten her or burn anyone&rsquo;s car. &ldquo;We broke up and I have moved on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Phumza should go to the police and tell them she saw me burning it. They will arrest me if I&rsquo;m guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said when she went to the police station to report the matter, they opened a case of arson and ignored her intimidation charge. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of malicious damage to property was opened at Putfontein cop shop in Ekurhuleni. &ldquo;The investigation is continuing but no one has been arrested for now,&rdquo; he said. Makhubele said at this stage, police cannot link Phumza&rsquo;s ex with the incident because there is no proof.&nbsp; Makhubele said that police opened a case of malicious damage to property when she came to report the cases because it was the major charge.
