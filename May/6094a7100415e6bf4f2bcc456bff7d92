THIS community&rsquo;s life has been made hell by water shortages. The people of Mpembeni claim their municipality, in northern KZN, is aware they have been without water for two months but has done nothing to fix the problem. Khethani Mlambo (45) said only one water truck came to the area each week.&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t enough for the whole village. Life is really hard for us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How do they expect us to survive without water? We end up getting sick after drinking water from streams.&rdquo; Jabu Ntuli (52) said they were tired of living without water.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wash our clothes in our houses. We are forced to walk long distances to streams,&rdquo; she said.Mayor Velenkosini Hlabisa, who also lives in the area, said he was fully aware of the matter. &ldquo;I am busy trying to have it fixed. &ldquo;I have been in meetings with the Umkhanyakude Municipality, which is in charge of supplying water to the area. &ldquo;We have been without water for too long and people are really suffering.&rdquo;He said because it was the district municipality&rsquo;s responsibility he didn&rsquo;t have much control. &ldquo;I urge residents to be patient because I&rsquo;m working on it,&rdquo; said Hlabisa.Mdu Dlamini, Umkhanyakude municipal spokesman, said the whole district was struggling with water shortages due to illegal connections. &ldquo;Some residents illegally connect their own water pipes to the municipal water system, which caused leaks. &ldquo;We have sent a team to fix the problem and they are currently working on it. &ldquo;We will meet all the local municipalities to find a solution.&rdquo;
