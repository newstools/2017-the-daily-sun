NOMAKA Mbeki Technical Secondary School at Ngcingwana Village, Dutywa in the Eastern Cape is ravaged by booze and drugs. Kids also take dangerous weapons to school and endanger the lives of teachers and other pupils. The school is situated in the home&nbsp;village of former president Thabo Mbeki. Between 2010 and 2015 the school got a 90% matric pass rate but last year it dropped to 26%. Some pupils smoke dagga and mandrax while others bring brandy to school and drink it near the toilets. The pupils who participate in these activities allegedly also leave the premises during school hours. The Eastern Cape Education Department held an imbizo on Thursday at the school. The aim was to come up with solutions to the bad behaviour of pupils at the school. Monde Sangqu, community liaison officer at the department, said after they became aware of the drugs and alcohol at the school, they asked the community to assist. &ldquo;We decided to invite church leaders, traditional leaders, business people and ward councillors to solve this problem.&rdquo; Grade 12 pupil Anam Mbambisa (17) said: &ldquo;Police have been visiting our school but the situation hasn&rsquo;t changed. I think the department should dismiss pupils who do not behave.&rdquo; Education MEC Mandla Makupula said: &ldquo;I am here to pledge that, as the department, we will work with you to make this school a better place. &ldquo;If the department of education, school and parents work together we can solve the problems at this school.&rdquo; The school&rsquo;s principal, Mpendulo&nbsp;Siguba, said he hopes the imbizo will solve their drug and alcohol problem.
