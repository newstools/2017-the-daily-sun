HIS attempts to steal a car did not go well. He managed to steal the vehicle, but then he drove it into a brick wall &ndash; and then he was murdered! The 37-year-old car thief stole the white Hyundai ix35 from a woman&rsquo;s yard in Extension 1, Vlakfontein, Joburg on Sunday. Residents said they heard a woman&rsquo;s scream followed by a huge bang. Residents ran outside and a few minutes later they were on top of the man, beating him up. A resident told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are tired of crime in the area. We sleep with one eye open because people break into our homes. These tsotsis should know we do not want criminals here.&rdquo; Sergeant Khalipha Mvula, the Lenasia South Police Station spokesman, said people must not take the law into their own hands. &ldquo;Community members must involve police in these matters. Killing a person is a crime,&rdquo; said Mvula. He said a case of murder was opened and investigations are continuing. &ldquo;We are appealing to eye witnesses to assist with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects who carried out this brutal killing.&rdquo;
