THOUSANDS of doctors working in Kenya's public hospitals
have agreed to end a 100-day strike after reaching a deal with the government yesterday
that aims to address their grievances.More than 5 000 health workers calling for nearly a 300
percent hike in pay went on strike in December, but it was not clear how much
of their demands were accepted.The government and union officials signed a deal to
address pay and other issues in dispute, said Dr Ouma Oluga, secretary-general
of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqYDOjbT46nROEYDYabn8A510H8OdEkb8hQmUkmZb--x-QlE_dtzeTwRSNbT97HBJ5UGCwUYbr24TlWkpLmDfjjIB5wtqpDWBtR-gp1NuUcYWt-FBKwj8GJK4fjd3mwYmIVTRVCmD2JJc_8b9dDfryEmaFjg2dewaV2qJSN0rdGb4psGinVvN3K16fT_Tr4jP4yuDOiqNDm1UGTmTybyv3b56GDrQy9EFcfk8MAMu8Y3ifBkhNBntkaT27KKX2PnjI2yHVltTLRXBvk7Fi37pW2YZwLCSy5OXUUg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFCtb88fpJdIEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

universities, earn a basic salary of $400 to $850 (about R5200 and R11 000) a
month."It is regrettable that it took so long. Kenyans have
suffered... We cannot fathom the extent of pain which Kenyans felt in the 100
days," said Kenya's Health Minister Cleopa Mailu.Dozens of people died during the strike as the majority
of Kenyans cannot afford private health care.The doctors pushed for the implementation of a 2013
collective bargaining agreement that committed the government to increase pay
and restore run down public health facilities, among other issues. It also set
out measures to address the East African country's huge shortage of doctors.The government said it does not recognise the 2013
agreement.The Kenyan government on Friday started cracking the whip
on the striking doctors by firing them en masse for missing work without reason
and taking part in an illegal strike.The government withdrew a 50 percent pay raise offer
among other benefits that were meant to woo the doctors back and warned it will
not "succumb to threats and intimidation". It ordered them to resume
work or face disciplinary action.Al Jazeera's
Catherine Soi, reporting from a missionary hospital in Nairobi, said the
healthcare situation is terrible."The impact of the strike is very severe. Hospitals
are overwhelmed. Beds are packed end to end. Hundreds of patients are lining up
to be treated," Soi said.The strike comes amid fierce criticism of the government
of President Uhuru Kenyatta, who is seeking re-election in August when the East
African nation holds presidential and parliamentary elections.Lawmakers are investigating allegations that tens of
millions of dollars have gone missing from Kenya's Ministry of Health and the
National Youth Service.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/03/kenya-doctors-strike-deal-government-170314084246054.html
