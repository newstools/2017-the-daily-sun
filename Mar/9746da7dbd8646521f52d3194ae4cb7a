COSATU has called on President Jacob Zuma to intervene in the ongoing Sassa crisis and to get rid of Department of Social Services Minister Bathabile Dlamini."This is not just an administrative bungling, but a political own goal that smells of corruption," said Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali.He was speaking at a media briefing at the labour federation's headquarters today, following its central executive committee, which took place throughout the week.There are fears that millions of South Africans might go without social grants at the end of the month when the social security agency's invalid contract with Cash Paymaster Services expires, as per the order set down by the Constitutional Court."Cosatu is appealing to the president to intervene and heads need to roll at Sassa," said Ntshalintshali.He said Dlamini and her team need to also take political responsibility for the crisis.Ntshalintshali said Dlamini and senior leaders at the department had failed to act decisively when it came to irregular expenditure and tender processes.Ntshalintshali said it was not easy for the federation to call for a minister to step down."But the fact that they did not tender properly for two years leads us to only one conclusion," he said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sassa-debacle-smells-of-corruption-cosatu-20170302
