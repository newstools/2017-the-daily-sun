PSL coaches have mixed feelings about the eagerly awaited Absa Premiership Soweto derby between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm).SunSport spoke to a few coaches to get their views about Steve Komphela and Kjell Jonevret&rsquo;s clubs and the majority are predicting a draw on Saturday.Cavin Johnson (Platinum Stars): &ldquo;I think Pirates will be more enthusiastic because they have a new coach. But Steve Komphela has raised the bar and Chiefs are more stable than Pirates. Current form goes out the window in a derby.&rdquo;Prediction: Draw. Roger de Sa (Maritzburg United): &ldquo;Everyone favours Chiefs and it&rsquo;s normal, due to their current form and better preparation. Pirates have had some distractions but their players will put that aside. They will be highly motivated by the chairman, staff and new coach. I don&rsquo;t think form will count on the day.&rdquo; Prediction: Draw. Clinton Larsen (Golden Arrows): &ldquo;It will be an interesting clash. Pirates have a new coach and will have an extra spring. Their players may follow a different approach. Chiefs have been on a good run and are consistent but Pirates seem to have turned the corner.&rdquo;Prediction: &ldquo;I am not good at betting.&rdquo; Gordon Igesund (Highlands Park): &ldquo;We all know the local derby is huge world-wide. It will be a tough one and you can&rsquo;t decide on form, even though Chiefs are on a good run. Pride will be at stake, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you are on the league table. It takes time to build a team and I think the Pirates coach needs time. But the players know what the derby is all about.&rdquo;Prediction: Draw. Eric Tinkler (Cape Town City): &ldquo;I say Chiefs probably, because they are on a roll. They seem to have turned the corner. There is a lot of pressure on the players in the derby.&rdquo;Prediction: Win for Chiefs.
