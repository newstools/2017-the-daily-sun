SANPARKS has turned to new technology to fight poaching. Chief ranger Nicholus Funda told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are using technology not to replace human beings but to complement them.&rdquo; Speaking at a media briefing at the Kruger National Park&rsquo;s Skukuza camp in Mpumalanga on Wednesday, he said they could only win the battle by using people and technology. &ldquo;Technology is helping us to detect human movements, especially at night.&rdquo; Nicholus said five of the 10 new gates being built should be completed by next month. SANParks has been increasing security at points of entry as poachers often enter the park disguised as tourists. Technical director Mark McGill said there had been cases where cars would enter the park with more than four occupants but when the vehicle left, there was only a driver. He said the new security system would enable them to monitor everyone who came in and out. Mark said the radar machine called a Postcode Meerkat was put in the park in December. SANParks CEO Fundisile Mketeni said they were prepared to do everything in their power to fight poachers. He said although the strategy of using K9 unit dogs in the parks had been effective, more ways to trace poachers were also needed.
