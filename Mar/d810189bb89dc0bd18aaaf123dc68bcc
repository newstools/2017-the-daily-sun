INSIDERS believe that a war over gold dust led to killings over the weekend.On Sunday the police found six bodies near a railway line in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. On Monday eight more bodies were discovered in the same area.A community leader told Daily Sun the killings are linked to fighting between Zimbabwean and Zulu zama zamas from Lindelani squatter camp.&ldquo;On Sunday the Zulus got guns from a hostel and went to an illegal mine.&rdquo; It appears, however, that the Zimbabwean miners were not killed with guns.Gauteng police spokesman Lungelo Dlamini said early findings indicate the men may all have been killed with sharp objects.&ldquo;We suspect the men were killed in an unknown area and then dumped at different locations in Benoni,&rdquo; said Dlamini.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to find out where they were killed.&rdquo;Acting national commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane released a statement that strongly condemned the killings.He said Gauteng commissioner Lieutenant-General Deliwe de Lange and her team are overseeing the investigation into the murders. &ldquo;We will wait for the investigation to advance and the victims to be identified before speculating on a motive,&rdquo; said Phahlane. &ldquo;SAPS remains committed to reducing the levels of serious crime and we are focusing on refining our crime prevention and operational plans towards this end.&rdquo;
