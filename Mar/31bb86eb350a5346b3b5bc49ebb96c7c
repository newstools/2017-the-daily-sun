BAFANA BAFANA are struggling to find a coach and are now targeting Stuart Baxter and former Orlando Pirates trainer Ruud Krol. The two coaches have good track records in the PSL. Krol did an exceptional job, winning the treble with the Buccaneers while Baxter was the darling of the Amakhosi supporters recently.&nbsp;It was reported last week that Herve Renard and Hugo Broos were in a two-horse race but it has emerged that Safa cannot tie neither of the two coaches down.&nbsp;Meanwhile, stand-in coach Owen da Gama revealed that he was badly affected by the resignation of players from the national team.&nbsp;Kermit Erasmus and Kamohelo Mokotjo returned to the national set-up after they retired due to a fallout with ex-coach, Shakes Mashaba.Da Gama included both players in his 25-man strong squad to face Guinea-Bissau and Angola in the upcoming international friendlies.&nbsp;Bafana will meet African Wild Dogs at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium on 25 March and then tackle Angola three days later. Erasmus has already given the thumbs up to his call-up via Twitter. Said Da Gama: &ldquo;I felt hurt because I was a player as well. It&rsquo;s not nice when a player resigns from the national team. We should try and prevent that as much as possible.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to have players playing in the big leagues. You need to show confidence in them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch them play at any given moment because they will create competitive edge within the team.&nbsp;&ldquo;We should do everything in our power to get these players to play for Bafana.&rdquo;Da Gama wants to create a conducive working relationship with players, something that seemed lacking during Mashaba&rsquo;s era.&ldquo;I want to instil professionalism among players and make every player feel he can play for his country. We&rsquo;ll do our best to instil confidence in our players.&rdquo; Da Gama said they chose to play Guinea-Bissau because their playing style was similar.&nbsp;
