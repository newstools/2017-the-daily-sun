A CROCODILE in northern Zimbabwe has allegedly killed and eaten an eight-year-old child. Grim footage of what appear to be human remains being recovered from the crocodile were posted to YouTube by the online news outletBulawayo24. The footage shows men slitting open the crocodile and retrieving human parts from its belly. These are then placed on a grey blanket as onlookers watch the grim operation with their arms folded. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstA5rRuRhbeA2pZo5MdeA35pAhdq-S4sc9mfsPFFVA50ZmQd1l5H8UEIKUjx5AlU3-B6ScPHQnmLxqfUOIy3Z1JbQ6BH0MaOWE_dY3aazZaqHkCLN7KhRYMFD8pmS9a-WBpgvhRu1xteEmuEWAvh2P9rqKNd_3YwpqlTye9xCiX_qcIIEIKTKvHLkw90hljP-MgPM_P7-iPH2xCkPjTR3rQ3aCcS-fOckuGQTEKxYQRwg7WV_Hlkzvjchb4UulFEJzW2Qr3zMpFnxQJNTiyVWxc2lUoBpE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNqBwh7EekvzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The boy’s remains were found in the beast’s stomach.“A source said the young boy’s remains were buried on Wednesday,” said Sithole. There were no more details on the tragedy, which has not yet been confirmed by the authorities. Heavy rain has been pounding Zimbabwe, causing flooding in the south of the country and rising river and dam levels elsewhere. This means crocodiles can now move to places where they are not normally seen. Earlier this month, a crocodile shot dead by rangers in Beatrice was found with what looked like the remains of a fishermen in its stomach. – NEWS24
