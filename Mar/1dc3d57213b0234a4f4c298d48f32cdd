GOGO Buyisiwe Zikhali believes her son, who ran into a moving goods train, is haunted by evil spirits. The 62-year-old gogo from Mfekayi Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, said her son was injured after a run-in with the train on Tuesday. She told Daily Sun her son Nhlonipho (38) was not trying to kill himself but was being controlled by evil spirits. He had been behaving strangely and hearing voices since January. He has been seeing invisible people and I heard him begging them not to kill him, she said. Gogo Buyisiwe said on Tuesday morning that Nhlonipho had said he was going to the outside toilet. When he didn t come back I thought he had gone to watch television at our neighbour s. Later, I got a call that he had been knocked over by a train! She rushed to the scene and found her son badly injured. He was then rushed to hospital. A police source, said the victim s front teeth fell out of his mouth while they were waiting for the ambulance. It took a long time to arrive and then the vehicle got stuck in the mud while transporting him to hospital, said the cop. We had to call a tractor to pull the ambulance out. Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said that someone had sent an evil creature to try and kill Nhlonipho. If the family doesn t heal him, he will die and come back to trouble other family members, he said. KwaZulu-Natal police spokeswoman, Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, confirmed the incident. The man sustained head injuries and was taken to hospital, she said. A case was opened for investigation.
