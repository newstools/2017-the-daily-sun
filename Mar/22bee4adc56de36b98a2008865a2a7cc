ITUMELENG Mpatlanyana (34) is bringing fresh flavours ekasi with his delicious grilled chicken. The entrepreneur, who was born and raised at Embalenhle in Mpumalanga, is the founder and CEO of fast-food franchise Nkukhu-Box. Although the South African fast-food industry is dominated by foreign brands, Itumeleng&rsquo;s passion for food has helped him find success. He has been in the food industry for about 10 years and is also the founder of Spykos Chisa Nyama. He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I never wanted to work for someone. I&rsquo;ve always been taken by the idea of being my own boss and being financially free.&rdquo; He said Nkukhu-Box embraced township flavours and the kasi lifestyle. Explaining his brand, he said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fast-food franchise that uses a grilled chicken concept.&rdquo; Itumeleng said the first store was launched in Mamelodi West in August. He said the business model he had come up with dealt with all the industry challenges he had faced in the past, including high rental costs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re bringing something fresh and convenient to the township. We have long trading hours.&rdquo;The store is made up of specially designed shipping containers, meaning it&rsquo;s cost effective. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to rely on shopping centres, which often have very high rentals. It&rsquo;s easy to move the shop to a new area if it&rsquo;s not performing well.&rdquo; Itumeleng said he believed his new business was a game changer. &ldquo;In times like these you need to be innovative as an entrepreneur. You need to think outside the box.&rdquo; Itumeleng has 48 staff members. He plans to double his staff soon. The store sells full chickens, wings, livers and healthy kotas with greens, avocado and bacon on low GI bread.
