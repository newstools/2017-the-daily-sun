KIDS from Grahamstown and Ndlambe schools met last week at New Rest Stadium in Port Alfred to try out jukskei. Eastern Cape jukskei team manager Debbie Erasmus said they held the games in the kasi as they want people to join in.&ldquo;Most people still think jukskei is only played by whites, which is not true.&rdquo; She added that the province is behind compared to others where the game is widely played. &ldquo;The good thing is you can play it even if you are 60. There is no age restriction. The oldest player is 90. We also train those in wheelchairs,&rdquo; said Erasmus.Sarah Baartman jukskei chairwoman Boniwe Hendele said even though some schools did not make it, she was happy with the commitment of those who came. &ldquo;We are going to keep introducing jukskei to our townships until it is as popular as other sports.&rdquo;She said they decided to have the games on a Saturday as they did not want to disturb pupils&rsquo; schoolwork during the week and are thankful to teachers who accompanied the kids.&ldquo;These teachers played a huge role in making sure the kids are here today and we know they have better things to do, but still they chose to come when we invited them, so we appreciate it.&rdquo; Archie Mbolekwa Higher Primary teacher Thembakazi Gumenge, from Grahamstown, said: &ldquo;We know kids involved in sport tend to do well at school. That is why we are supporting them.&rdquo;She added that even though most kids knew nothing about the game, she could tell that as time went by, more people would join in.&ldquo;What I like about jukskei is that you don&rsquo;t need a fancy stadium to play it. Once you find a small space where you can lay sand, you are good to go.&rdquo; Liyabona Mnyungula from Fikizolo Primary said before playing jukskei he used to play soccer. &ldquo;I enjoy jukskei more now.&rdquo;
