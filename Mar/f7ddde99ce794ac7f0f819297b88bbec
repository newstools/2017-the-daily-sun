RESIDENTS have to fear no more.This is because an old electricity building that posed great danger to the people of KwaMashu J Section, north of Durban, has been demolished.The building had been turned into a hideout for thugs, and boys used to smoke there. A &ldquo;strange&rdquo; man also slept there, said a local resident.Municipal workers broke the brick building to the ground on Wednesday. Now the locals are happy.Resident Nuh Mkhaliphi (32) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I was pleased when I saw a tractor destroying the building.&ldquo;We can now walk freely without having to worry about getting robbed by the thugs who used to hide there.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been asking the eThekwini Municipality for a long time to demolish the building, and they have finally done it.&rdquo;She said the building had been there for years. &ldquo;It was on the road that we use when we go to the shops or clinic, and it was near a school as well.&rdquo; Nuh said. &ldquo;I used to walk a longer route because I feared the thugs who used to hide in the building. &ldquo;Boys used the place as a smoking zone after school.&rdquo;The building had two rooms.&ldquo;A strange man lived in one room and thugs used the other room,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We feared that our kids would go there and get hurt. &ldquo;Maybe the unknown man would rape or even kill our children.&ldquo;In the end we are happy that our plea was heard.&rdquo;
