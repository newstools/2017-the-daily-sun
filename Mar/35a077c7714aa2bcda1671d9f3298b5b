SNAKES are making Susan Mahlangu&rsquo;s life a living hell! The 51-year-old mother of two from Extension 11 in Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, said she was on top of the moon the day she was allocated a stand. However, she claims, the stand is a breeding ground for snakes. There are snakes in her yard and, being a prophet, she has been labelled a snake owner. However, Susan said prophet or no prophet, she is living in fear for her life. &ldquo;The first week I moved to my new home I killed a cobra. Ever since then, every week there is a snake we kill,&rdquo; she said. Susan claimed that even at the moment there is a snake in her living room and no one is willing to help her kill it. &ldquo;I hired someone to remove the carpet. As we were removing the carpet we saw the biggest snake I have ever seen. The man immediately rolled back the carpet and fled. I don&rsquo;t blame him,&rdquo; she said. She asked neighbours to help her kill it but they refused. Daily Sun contacted local councillor Mahlaku Maleka who said she has referred the matter to the City of Tshwane. Snake handler Jaco Grobler said Susan might have built her shack on a snake nest. &ldquo;She should buy a snake repellent or get a professional to help her get rid of the snakes in her yard,&rdquo; he said.
