THE NEW Bafana Bafana coach could be unveiled on Thursday, with Hugo Broos and Herve Renard said to be the only two horses truly left in the race.SunSport understands that Broos, the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) winning coach, could be the man to land the job after his nomination was seconded by a number of selection committee members.Safa boss Danny Jordaan, who is currently in Lusaka, Zambia, where he watched yesterday&rsquo;s Youth Afcon match between Sudan and South Africa&rsquo;s Under-20s at the National Heroes Stadium, returns to SA tomorrow. It has been reported that he will use the time in Zambia to also interview Broos and Renard, who were expected to attend the tournament.SunSport understands that there is an urgent two-day meeting lined up for the selection committee comprising Lucas Radebe, Benni McCarthy, Dennis Mumble, Buti Mathathe, Anna Nyman, Neil Tovey and technical committee chairwoman Natasha Tsichlas.A decision will be made by Wednesday and an announcement could follow the next day, after last week&rsquo;s disappointing news that Carlos Queiroz withdrew due to a clause in his contract with the Iranian FA.It gets even messier. SunSport has learnt that selection committee members are divided on whether to go for 64-year-old Broos, whose contract with the Indomitable Lions only expires after the Fifa World Cup next year. It has been made clear that Broos is unhappy with Cameroon&rsquo;s Federation, which allegedly short-changed him and the players who were promised bonuses after the 2017 Afcon in Gabon.The 48-year-old Renard, on the other hand, is apparently readily available, believed to be not too expensive and would bring a wealth of experience to Safa, having won Afcon with Zambia in 2012 and again in 2015 with Ivory Coast.Some selection committee members said they would prefer a local coach and the names of Bidvest Wits&rsquo; Gavin Hunt, SuperSport United&rsquo;s Stuart Baxter and Pitso Mosimane of Mamelodi Sundowns popped up again.Although Baxter and Mosimane have said in public that they are not interested in the job, their names keep coming up.Jordaan confirmed yesterday that he would be back in the country tomorrow and would meet with committee members to finalise the appointment.He said: &ldquo;Everybody has his or her own favourite but the committee is tasked with the appointment of the coach and that is what we will do. I know the wait has been long but we want the best man for the job.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Safa&rsquo;s legal team will meet disgruntled ex-Bafana coach, Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba, at the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday as he fights his dismissal. Mashaba lost his Labour Court bid to stop Safa from employing a coach before his case has been heard by the CCMA.
