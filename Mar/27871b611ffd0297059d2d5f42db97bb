He grew up in front of my eyes but now he&rsquo;s my superman.&nbsp; &ldquo;People used to talk but now they have accepted that I&rsquo;m dating a younger man. My Ben 10 gives me life and I feel young again because of him. No one will take him from me because I take care of him. Even my family has accepted him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Morena said he&rsquo;s never liked dating younger women because they complained a lot. &ldquo;Flora is the love of my life.
