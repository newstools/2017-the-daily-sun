THINGS got messy in the Joburg CBD yesterday when the SunTeam had a run-in with alleged job scammers who were trying to deal with angry people who claim they paid R500 to R1 000 for jobs they never got.Desperate job seekers told Daily Sun a company based in Albert Street, Joburg had scammed them out of thousands. I arrived when the furious group, some of whom had travelled from the Cape, vowed to moer the company&rsquo;s employees. Some even phoned the police. They got very angry when a Joburg Central cop asked me why I was taking photos. They accused the cop of protecting the so called scammers.Thabo Olyn said he paid R500 for a job as a driver but every time he went to the company&rsquo;s offices, he was told he had to wait to go on a test drive. The SunTeam overheard the alleged scammers telling angry clients they could open a case but it would go nowhere, as they had signed application forms before handing over their money. At one point, two women who apparently work for the empowerment company grabbed my camera and pinned me to the floor! The office only had two computers and a few plastic chairs. Daily Sun eventually managed to speak to the manager, who said he has not been scamming people, and his business was above board. As I was leaving, some of the angry job seekers were told they would be refunded in three weeks time. Constable Moloko Kgatla said the victims needed to make a civil case as they had voluntarily signed documents.
