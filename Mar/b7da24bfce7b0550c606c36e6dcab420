MAMELODI Sundowns&rsquo; MultiChoice Diski Challenge coach David Notoane says his next focus is linking up with one of Mzansi&rsquo;s stellar junior national teams. After winning the Diski Challenge with Sundowns and travelling to the Netherlands as part of their prize, Notoane is now looking forward to the Under-20 World Cup in South Korea, where he will be on the bench as Thabo Senong&rsquo;s assistant. The former SuperSport United and Santos striker was not part of Amajita&rsquo;s technical team at the recent Africa U-20 Cup of Nations in Zambia due to his commitments with the Young Brazilians MDC team. Now the MDC season has came to an end, the coach gets the opportunity to accompany Amajita to the World Cup. Notoane has been part of SA&rsquo;s junior team setup in the past, so his experience will be key when Mzansi&rsquo;s youngsters compete against the world&rsquo;s best in the showpiece in South Korea. He was Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba&rsquo;s assistant at the SA Under-23 team in 2011. More recently he guided Sundowns to the MDC title after they were runners-up for two seasons. The 48-year-old Notoane says the journey does not end here. He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m passionate about youth coaching, I&rsquo;ve been up and down in the PSL, National First Division and ABC Motsepe League. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with Santos as head coach, Royal Eagles as an assistant in the NFD, I was the SA Under-20 acting head coach and the assistant too.&ldquo;This success came due to experience, the mileage I have done over the years. I&rsquo;m happy where I am at the moment and I&rsquo;m happy with my growth and development as a coach. &ldquo;Next up is the World Cup with Amajita &ndash; and we know what we will be up against in Asia.&rdquo;Notoane hopes he gets a chance to lead Amajita and Young Bafana some day.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s every coach&rsquo;s dream to be a national team coach, whether at senior or junior level, but I&rsquo;m not going to rush that. I&rsquo;m a tactician, I&rsquo;m driven by the quality of work I put in and the impact and legacy I leave.&rdquo;SunSport&rsquo;s Mthokozisi Mkhonza is in the Netherlands as a guest of SuperSport.
