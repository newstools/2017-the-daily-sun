Are you the girl who just wears black, white or rude cotton bras?&nbsp; Switch up your style by introducing a lace bra,&nbsp; But... take it further by investing in the bralette.&nbsp; Bring out your feminine sex appeal by wearing a lace bralette under a low cut top/dress or wear it on it's own.&nbsp; The bralette is a bra that has no molded cups that provide support, because of this, the bralette supports ladies with small to average busted woman.&nbsp; They are commonly made from lace, microfiber or cotton.&nbsp; The bralette is a very skimpy bra, which is perfect to show your sexy side.&nbsp;Just be mindful of the fact that because lace is sheer, your nipples can be seen through the bralette. To avoid looking trashy, wear a bralette layered with another item like a jacket or a tang top.&nbsp;Bralettes have become the new crop, and can be worn in jeans or a sexy figure hugging skirt.&nbsp; Check some of these celebrities rocking the trend: &nbsp;....kinda obsessed with ripped jeans..
