HE SMOKED nyaope for 11 years.He tried hard to quit &ndash; but never could.And when bluetooth became the in thing for nyaope smokers, Paul Sono (23) of Mmakau, near Mothutlung in North West also got hooked. That was his greatest mistake!His sister Mmapula Sono (34) said her brother contracted HIV while sharing blood through syringes to get high.When his family found out about his status it was too late. He died on Friday.What pains his family is that he died while looking for help. After his death, they found a letter in which he was pleading for help to stop his habit, but he never had time to give it to anyone.Mmapula said her family blames the bluetooth method of taking drugs for Paul&rsquo;s death. She said things changed after he was introduced to it, because her brother was healthy until two weeks ago.He started complaining of chest pain and was feeling weak. &ldquo;We took him to a clinic and tests were done on him. He came out HIV-positive and his liver was no longer functioning.&ldquo;His sharing blood with other addicts took his life. Smoking is bad enough, but injecting with blood was worse.&rdquo; She said the family warned him about the danger of sharing blood but he didn&rsquo;t listen. &ldquo;He used to tell us he knew the risks and was using loyal partners and saving.&rdquo; Mmapula said addicts claimed sharing blood was the way to go if they didn&rsquo;t have enough money to buy drugs.&ldquo;They said they pay R10 and mix 30ml of the drug, injecting themselves with 10ml each, and using the same syringe. Others should learn from what happened to him and have blood tests before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;Paul will be buried at Mothutlung Cemetery on Saturday.
