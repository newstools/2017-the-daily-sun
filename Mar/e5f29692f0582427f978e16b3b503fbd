FREE State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka is hoping lightning will not strike the same place twice! Last week Ea Lla Koto lost 1-0 to Highlands Park in their Absa Premiership encounter at Goble Park in Bethlehem. The two teams will meet again in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round at the same venue on Saturday (3.30pm). Losing to the same team twice in the space of seven days is unthinkable for Letsoaka. Ea Lla Koto dominated their Premiership encounter but still lost the game. They now have an opportunity to avenge their league defeat. Letsoaka said he would make a couple of changes with one eye on their league game against Ajax Cape Town in Cape Town on Friday 17 March. Stars are one point above the relegation zone. They occupy 14th place with 18 points from 20 games. The league is more important than any cup game at this stage. But the fact that they lost to the Premiership rookies last week will spur Ea Lla Koto on to come out guns blazing in this cup tie. Letsoaka said: &ldquo;We are going all out for a win in the cup match. We can&rsquo;t lose to the same opposition at home twice in such a short space of time. &ldquo;It will be a different ball game in the cup and I admit they will be a difficult team to break down, as was the case last week.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we have been working on a different approach for this match. &ldquo;We will use this game to prepare for our next league against Ajax which is also important.&rdquo; Letsoaka is hoping the match will be decided in regulation time. He does not want to see the game go to extra time or penalties: &ldquo; I would hate it if the game goes to extra time. I don&rsquo;t want to see the players suffer fatigue. I hope it will end in 90 minutes.&rdquo; Letsoaka is not worried about injuries or suspensions, he simply hopes for a bigger dose of luck this weekend.
