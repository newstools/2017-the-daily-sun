CHIEF Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng&rsquo;s office confirmed yesterday that Sassa had met its 4pm deadline and electronically submitted documents to the Constitutional Court regarding social grant payments. Mogoeng&rsquo;s spokesman, Nathi Mncube said: &ldquo;Sassa met its deadline. They submitted papers before 4pm.&rdquo; However, it was not clear whether Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini filed her answers. A task team of cabinet ministers rejected the deal negotiated between Sassa and outsourced service provider Cash Paymaster Services. CPS was supposed to guarantee the payment of social grants on 1 April. Sassa CEO Wiseman Magasela told the ConCourt in an affidavit that the task team included Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, State Security Minister David Mahlobo, Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, Telecommunications Minister Siyabonga Cwele and Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor. The Constitutional Court sent numerous questions to Dlamini and Sassa demanding answers on the social grant payment crisis. Dlamini is due to appear before the court tomorrow to explain why a 2014 agreement stating Sassa would start handling grant payments from April 2017 was not implemented. Social justice organisation Black Sash approached the court when it became clear Sassa was not ready to take over grant payments. The organisation wants the court to force the minister to make public all arrangements made with Cash Paymaster Services for the payment of grants from next month.
