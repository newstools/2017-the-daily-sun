Every day gogo Alice sits on the pavement of busy Dr Pixley KaSeme Street in the Durban CBD.She sells her handmade cotton and woollen shoes from a small table. The SunTeam caught up with the gogo who lives in a flat in the Durban CBD last week.She was crocheting shoes on the side of the busy road.Gogo Alice makes colourful shoes of all sizes.She claims she was the first person in Durban to make the unusual shoes. “I’ve been doing this for the past 40 years. Many people have asked me to teach them how to make them. “I’ve taught a lot of people who now run their own businesses right here in town.” She said after working in Durban for so many years, she is ready to travel to other countries. “I think my work would be appreciated more elsewhere. “There are a lot of people who do the same work that I do in the Durban area. “I don’t make enough money anymore. “I would sell more of my beautiful shoes if I were to move to the United States.“The money I make would not support a family. It’s a good thing that I don’t have a family to look after.“I live alone and sometimes visit my sisters and their children. I’m glad no one is dependent on me.” However gogo Alice said she would really appreciate having someone help her sell her work overseas.
