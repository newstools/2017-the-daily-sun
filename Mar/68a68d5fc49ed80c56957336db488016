WHEN the 16-year-old confessed to having sex with her teacher, he said he would marry her. But the promise the 40-year-old man made to the girl&rsquo;s 78-year-old gogo was not kept, leading to her running away from home! The gogo from Orinoco, outside Thulamahashe in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun her granddaughter sent her a letter saying she was in Phalaborwa in Limpopo and would not return home.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shattered. I raised her with my pension grant after her parents died. She was devastated that her affair with her maths teacher ruined her reputation,&rdquo; said the gogo. She said the trouble started last year when the girl went missing one night and confessed the next morning that she had been with her teacher. &ldquo;I confronted the principal and he called in the teacher, who admitted it. He said he loved my granddaughter and would marry her,&rdquo; said the gogo. Angry villagers stormed the school and chased the teacher away. School governing body chairwoman Alice Mashaba said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t receive a complaint from the child&rsquo;s family or school management. The principal only spoke of it after the teacher was chased away.&rdquo; Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the teacher was suspended and counselling was arranged for the pupil.Police Captain Dudu Phiri said the matter is under investigation.
