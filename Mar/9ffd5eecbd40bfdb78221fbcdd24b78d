Kaizer Chiefs will be determined to avoid an upset when they face a fired up Stellenbosch side in a Nedbank Cup last 32 encounter at Athlone on Saturday.The match is set for an 8:15pm kick off.Chiefs, who last won the competition in 2013, are the most successful club in the tournament's history (including under previous sponsorships), having won it 13 times.Amakhosi head into the game in good form with five wins and three draws in their last eight league matches.For newly-formed Stellenbosch, this is the first time they are participating in the competition, although under the club's previous guise as Vasco da Gama, they made it as far as the semi-final stage in 2015 before losing 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns.The Cape Winelands-based team - coached by former AmaTuks man Sammy Troughton - are in good league form, occupying fourth spot on the National First Division (NFD) table and are unbeaten in their last five outings.They have in their ranks former top-flight players such as leading scorer Zaid Patel, Manti Mekoa, David Booysen and Siyabonga Shoyisa.&nbsp;Troughton admits the game is a great opportuchancenity for his players to get some exposure, but says the league is where his main priority lies - they are only a point outside the play-offs."It could be an opportunity to get some confidence, but Chiefs are one of the form teams at the moment and are capable of giving you a bit of a smack if you don&rsquo;t take them seriously," he told&nbsp;KickOff."People might not understand if I say I'd rather have the victory over Black Leopards over the weekend than Chiefs this weekend, because that's the way it is - our bread and butter is Leopards, Cosmos and the rest of the league fixtures."Troughton is assisted by another former Tuks coach, Steve Barker, and both of them have enjoyed successful Nedbank Cup runs with the Pretoria club in the past.Chiefs midfielder George Maluleka was also previously at Tuks and therefore in a good position to know what to expect from Stellenbosch and has urged his teammates not to be complacent against the lower league opposition."From the years that I have worked with both coaches [in the AmaTuks development] I can tell you now that it's going to be a very challenging game for us," he told the Chiefs website."All their teams are known for being fighters and we need to be prepared for that come Saturday&nbsp;"They are fourth on the NFD log for a reason and that is because of coach Steve and Sammy, very intelligent coaches who have been in this game for a long time and know what it takes to cause an upset. We will obviously be aware of that and prepare accordingly."We are going into this game with a serious mindset, forget which league they [Stellenbosch] are playing in. We want to make sure that we get a positive result, we don't want any surprises."A positive result come Saturday will enable us to progress to the next stage of the Nedbank Cup and that is important to us in our quest to win the trophies that are left for us," he added.Neither team has any suspensions but Bernard Parker and Sibusiso Khumalo are both one yellow card away from a one-match&nbsp;
