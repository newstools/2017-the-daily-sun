WESTERN Cape political parties have called for Premier Helen Zille to resign after she posted a tweet that appeared to defend colonialism.They were speaking during a debate at the Legislature yesterday.Khaya Magaxa, the ANC&rsquo;s provincial acting chairman, said: &ldquo;Zille was heartless enough to share the disgusting and barbaric tweet when the country was commemorating Human Rights Day.&rdquo;Magaxa said Zille often posted offensive remarks on social media, only to turn around and give half-hearted apologies and say she had been misquoted. &ldquo;She is the only person who is being misquoted in this country,&rdquo; he said. EFF Western Cape chairman Bernard Joseph said: &ldquo;Colonialism was used and is still used to oppress black people. As the EFF, we ask Zille to do the honourable thing and resign immediately.&rdquo; But the DA&rsquo;s Masizole Mnqasela said Zille was an honest, humble hard worker, and she was generous, even to people she did not know. She was also popular with black South Africans.Zille had not responded at the time of going to print.The ANC members were left frustrated after the DA members dogged the debate by talking about other topics. The ANC&rsquo;s Cameron Dugmore said the speaker must recuse herself for failing to guide the debate. &ldquo;The problem here is that we are just playing games here. My whole input was around colonialism, that&rsquo;s what I wanted us to debate,&rdquo; said Magaxa. The DA&rsquo;s Dylan Mitchel spent almost the whole of his debate evading the Twitter issue. Fernandez said she has no power to control the content of the debate and argued the content she received from Magaxa&rsquo;s last year was broad.
