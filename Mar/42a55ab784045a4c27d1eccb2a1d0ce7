Another teacher said they ha arrived in the morning at about 7am to find the principal’s office open.“Everything was scattered. “We realised it was a break-in and called the cops, who advised us not to touch anything.” Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KZN Education MEC, said: “We will follow up on this matter with the district.” KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incident. “A case of business burglary was opened at KwaMashu Police Station. “No arrest has been made at this stage,” said Gwala.
