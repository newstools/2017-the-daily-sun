SHE takes care of the traffic and she enjoys herself doing it.While directing the traffic she dances as if her life depends on it.Motorists watched with amusement and some made videos of the dancing, laughing cop. On a video taken on Saturday, road signs show the cop was working on the corner of William Nicol Drive and Cedar Road in Fourways, Joburg, apparently listening to music through her earphones.She is seen applauding motorists for doing the right thing and then she lifts up her hands and carries on dancing, taking the beat and stepping towards the side of the road, allowing cars that have been waiting to drive past.As the cars start moving, she gets down again in her nice moves, turning &rsquo;round and &rsquo;round, lifting her hands higher and higher. Though the identity of the cop has not been established, motorists seemed to like what they saw.After the video emerged on Facebook people expressed their feelings. Linda Bromley wrote: &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;Some posted smiling faces, while others wondered what song she was listening to.Michelle Johnson wrote: &ldquo;I love her enthusiasm!&rdquo;Lara Glanz said: &ldquo;Our entertainment driving to school.&rdquo;Edna Mamonyane, the JMPD spokeswoman, said they are aware of the video. She said there was nothing wrong with the cop dancing as long as she did not cause accidents.&nbsp;
