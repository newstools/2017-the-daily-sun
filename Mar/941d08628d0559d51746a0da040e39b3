FIRST there was Money Moreki and now there&rsquo;s Meat Moreki!Jabulani Zama from Umlazi, south of Durban, has been giving free meat to women and children in his community. When the SunTeam recently visited him, more than 100 women were queuing for fresh meat from Jabulani, who is the owner of the well-known Eyadini Lounge. He said he was handing out meat because he wanted to help needy people from his community. &ldquo;We do this every Tuesday and we have been doing it for three weeks now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been helping hungry women, children and even men on the street. &ldquo;We feed close to 250 families in one day and people appreciate it. We do sell meat but we put some aside so the families around here can cook and eat.&rdquo; Jabulani didn&rsquo;t want to tell the SunTeam how much money he spent on the meat he handed out to community members. Eyadini became incredibly popular recently after in-house dancer Zodwa Wabantu&rsquo;s sexy dance moves set tongues wagging on social media.
