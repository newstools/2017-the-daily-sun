REMAINING in the top three is a big priority for Kaizer Chiefs &ndash; and they can only achieve their goal if they beat Orlando Pirates in their Premiership clash at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Amakhosi are hoping to continue with their clean record at the expense of their struggling neighbours.Steve Komphela&rsquo;s charges haven&rsquo;t lost a match in their last seven league games and will be hoping to extend the record to eight.Komphela says the favourites tag makes players complacent and then they don&rsquo;t work hard in the match. He said: &ldquo;I just hate that &ndash; it sends the wrong message. Players read it and tend to relax. I wish I could erase it when somebody writes that. &ldquo;We need to employ mental maturity to understand that previous results count for nothing when it comes to the derby.&rdquo;Chiefs captain, Itumeleng Khune, stressed the importance of converting the chances they create. He said they never go into any derby against Bucs with the intention to walk away with just a point. &ldquo;When we don&rsquo;t get a win, we feel like we have lost. If we concede we push hard to equalise. &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s why derbies often end in draws, but it&rsquo;s never our intention. We want to win at all costs. &ldquo;We go into this game knowing that we are in a good position in the league, one point behind the leaders. If we win we go to the top. Our goal is to go for a win.&rdquo;A veteran of 24 Soweto derbies, Khune stressed the importance of keeping a clean sheet. He also shrugged off the notion of Chiefs going into this game as favourites.
