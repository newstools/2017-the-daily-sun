THE BEN 10 thought his love was all his woman needed.&nbsp; So when he peeked through the window and allegedly saw her kissing another man, he flew into a murderous rage.&nbsp; The 28-year-old allegedly kicked open the door and first stabbed the 43-year-old woman in the stomach, before turning his fury on the man.&nbsp; Daniel de Wee (49) was stabbed in the chest and died in the woman&rsquo;s backyard shack in Rietpoort, Smithfield in the Free State on Monday.&nbsp; The dead man&rsquo;s cousin, Nondaba Thasu (45), denied that Daniel had been in a relationship with the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cousin and the woman were neighbours who grew up together. He would often visit her to ask for sugar or salt.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said she was at home on Monday when she heard a woman screaming in the backyard shack next to their property.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went to investigate and found a young man holding a bloody knife.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told me he was sorry and said he thought something was going on between my cousin and the woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cousin was murdered for no reason.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he rots in jail,&rdquo; said Nondaba.&nbsp; Police spokesman Sergeant Yanga Ngcukana said cops were investigating a case of murder and assault, after a man was found dead and a woman rushed to Stoffel Coetzee Hospital in Smithfield for treatment.&nbsp; Ngcukana said the suspect was arrested at the scene and a murder weapon was found and confiscated.&nbsp; &ldquo;The suspect is expected to appear in the Smithfield Magistrates Court soon .&rdquo;
