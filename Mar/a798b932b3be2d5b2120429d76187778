SA FOOTBALL Association president Danny Jordaan outlined the plans for Bafana Bafana yesterday for what is expected to be an extremely important and busy year. He said Bafana would pursue success in four competitions this year &ndash; the Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) Cup and the Championship of African Nations (Chan), as well as qualification for key competitions, the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) and the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia. The Afcon qualifiers will start in June, in what could be the first challenge for the new Bafana coach to be announced by Jordaan on Wednesday. There are 12 groups, and the top team in the group qualifies automatically, seeing 12 teams progress outright. &ldquo;Then there are the four best second placed teams &ndash; in other words, any team in any group, if you lose a match and end up second, you could still get a spot as one of the best second placed teams,&rdquo; said Jordaan. &ldquo;What we want as the association, whatever the mix, no matter how you get there, we want Bafana to be in the final 16 of 2019 Afcon teams. &ldquo;We start away in Nigeria. It&rsquo;s a huge challenge but if we can get past them we will be well on our way. And the next two World Cup qualifiers are against Cape Verde, home and away. &ldquo;Again, if we get a good start in those two matches, we are close to qualifying for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.&rdquo;
