RESIDENTS have been complaining that their local cop shop is useless and that police respond late to crime incidents, and they fail to get convictions in court. So when Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and Acting National Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane visited Richmond on Wednesday, residents voiced their frustrations to the top cops. Nhleko and Phahlane&rsquo;s visit follows the murder of the Richmond municipal manager, Edward Sithole, on Monday. CPF chairman and local councillor Sifiso Mkhize said Sithole was gunned down a mere 500m from a cop shop, but police still failed to respond in time. &ldquo;The killers are still at large. No arrest has been made,&rdquo; said Mkhize. The ANC&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida region secretary and resident Mzi Zuma said they were happy they had a meeting with the minister and commissioner. &ldquo;We need radical changes at our cop shop. Many people have been killed but we have not seen any convictions. &ldquo;We are tired of poor police service. How many lives should be lost before cops stand up and do their jobs? &ldquo;We appeal to the minister to help us,&rdquo; said Zuma. Richmond cop shop station manager Lieutenant-Colonel Gugu Ngubane promised the minister they would change and work harder. Nhleko said he would follow up on the concerns that had been raised. &ldquo;I am shocked that the incident happened just a few metres away from the cop shop and police still failed to catch the killers,&rdquo; said Nhleko. &ldquo;A task team will investigate all the allegations. &ldquo;Cops play a crucial role in bringing killers to book.&rdquo;
