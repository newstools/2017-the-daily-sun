CASSPER&rsquo;S single, titled Tito Mboweni, took the number one spot on iTunes 20 minutes after its release, dethroning his rival AKA&rsquo;s The World Is Yours, which has been occupying the spot for weeks now.Former Reserve Bank governor, Tito Mboweni, was the first black South African man to have his signature on our bank notes, and that was an inspiration to many black people and a sign of how far the country had come. That inspiration still lingers on in the hearts of South Africans &ndash; young and old.Tito Mboweni is from Cassper&rsquo;s upcoming album, Thuto, which is dropping on 7 May.Said Mboweni: &ldquo;Young people having fun using old people&rsquo;s names, I love happy young people. Have fun sometimes. Things are far too depressing at times here.&rdquo;
