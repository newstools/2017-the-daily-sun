RESIDENTS of KwaMashu Hostel, north of Durban and Councillor Mzwethu Gwala brought a local housing project to a standstill on Monday. This came after a protest earlier in the day by residents who wanted to know why they were excluded from work on the project. Hostel committee member, Xolani Kubheka (59), said many residents had expected to get temporary jobs. &ldquo;We are not happy to see strangers working on the project, while we were given no explanation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s confusion as the project started before the local government election last year, when the area still fell under ward 39 and not ward 40 as it does now. &ldquo;All the planning and hiring was done at that time.&rdquo; A resident said it hurt to see strangers working while they sat at home without jobs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a known government policy that whenever there&rsquo;s a project in an area, half of the employees should be locals,&rdquo; said the resident. Gwala said after the election no one told him anything about the project. &ldquo;I tried to find out more but no one was willing to explain anything to me. &ldquo;Residents told me whenever they go to ask for jobs, they&rsquo;re told to come to ask me. &ldquo;Meanwhile, I don&rsquo;t know anything about the project. Now people are angry and are demanding to know who is behind it and why they have not been hired.&rdquo; He confirmed the project had been stopped.He said it would only continue once the relevant officials had explained to the residents what was going on.
