HIGHLANDS Park have secured the services of former Orlando Pirates striker Fikru Teferra Lemessa in a bid to avoid relegation.The 31-year-old player joined the Lions of the North on a three-month deal from Indian League second division side Mohammedan Sporting Club yesterday.Highlands coach Gordon Igesund confirmed the signing, saying they would rely on the scoring prowess of Fikru while Zambian striker Collins Mbesuma regains his scoring appetite. Mbesuma recently resumed training after recovering from knee surgery. Fikru could be pushed to make his debut for the Tembisa based outfit on Sunday (3.30pm) when they tackle fellow-relegation candidates Free State Stars in an Absa Premiership match at Goble Park Stadium. Said Igesund: &ldquo;Fikru is in good condition and has been active. He returned to South Africa from the Indian League, where he scored 11 goals.&rdquo;Igesund said they opted for Fikru as there was not enough time to wait for Mbesuma to recover. &ldquo;He holds the ball nicely and Collins also does that. But Collins still has another two weeks to get match fit and we haven&rsquo;t got time. We have good players and Fikru will add the much-needed strength to our strike force.&rdquo;
