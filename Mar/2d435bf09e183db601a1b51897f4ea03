THEIR faces are splashed all over billboards, posters, flyers and social media.But models Nyasha Moketi (27) and Utrishia Masheba (23) claim Darling Hair Company is using their faces fraudulently to sell their product.Now they want their faces removed from the product.&ldquo;We are the faces of Darling Hair and we were not even told about it!&rdquo; said Nyasha. They claimed the hair care company had been using their faces to sell their product since last year, but they had not seen a cent for their work. &ldquo;We were not even told we would be the faces of the brand. We were just invited to a photoshoot, which we attended with our agent. &ldquo;They took some pictures and we were paid R1 000.&ldquo;We confronted them and were shocked to learn we had a three-year contract with the brand. But we never signed any contract or agreed to any deal. They must remove our faces and pay us our money.&rdquo; Pearl Peane, the hair company&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said the allegations are false. &ldquo;We had an agreement with their agency and paid them,&rdquo; she said.Connie Matlobola, a representative from Bontle Batlogo, confirmed the girls were her clients and said they had a three-year contract with the hair company. &ldquo;I signed the contract on their behalf. That&rsquo;s how we do things at my agency. The matter is now going to court.&rdquo; Police spokesman Aubrey Moopeloa said a case of fraud was opened.
