She claims her makoti knew the pin code as she used to assist gogo every time they went shopping. “Though at first I was slightly suspicious, I dismissed it because I thought she was just playing with it. “I would see her typing things on it sometimes but I never thought she’d steal from me.” “Now I see why. She was taking my phone so that she could withdraw money and immediately delete the bank notifications.” said Gogo Emily. Gogo Emily said she almost collapsed when she was told by the bank she only had R6 in her account. She had gone to try and withdraw a large sum of money.“I confronted her and she disappeared without trace, leaving her four-year-old son behind.”The makoti disappeared two months ago and has been on the run ever since.Now gogo’s tombstone plans have even been put on hold. “I have opened a case against her because I want my money back,” she said.Police have confirmed that a case of theft has been opened and they are investigating.
