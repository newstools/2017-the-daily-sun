IMPOSING Uzalo actor Sifiso Simamane plays a strict top cop in the soapie.But it seems the talented actor&rsquo;s character keeps up the drama, even long after the lights, camera and action have stopped.This, as Sifiso stands accused of keeping up his role outside the studio by Bongani Madondo, a street vendor in Durban, KZN.Bongani claims Sifiso, who plays KwaMashu station commander Captain Mthimkhulu, is the reason behind the many fights with his baby mama, Xoli Ngcobo.&ldquo;He thinks he calls the shots in our relationship. He&rsquo;s a bad influence,&rdquo; said Bongani.He said he noticed something was wrong in his relationship, when his baby mama told him how he was nothing following an argument &ndash; something she had allegedly never done before.Bongani said: &ldquo;I confronted her about her remarks. And she told me she was in a relationship with Sifiso.&ldquo;I admit we had already separated, but we&rsquo;ve had a good relationship as parents all along.&rdquo;He said he confronted Sifiso, which did not end well.&ldquo;I went to talk to him, man to man, as my bad relationship with Xoli affected our child,&rdquo; Bongani said.&ldquo;But after admitting to having an affair with Xoli, he told me I was no match for him, which broke my heart.&rdquo;When contacted, Xoli told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy at work. But if you&rsquo;re calling about Bongani, I can&rsquo;t comment.&rdquo;She admitted to being in a relationship with Sifiso.&ldquo;We love each other, and I don&rsquo;t see why that should be an issue.&rdquo;Sifiso said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t comment.&rdquo;
