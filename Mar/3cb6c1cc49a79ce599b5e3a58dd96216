Yesterday, one more suspect was caught at the same spot, bringing the number of arrested suspects to seven. The man was carrying side cutters, pliers and hacksaws. It is said that two groups of izinyoka work in shifts so they can get as much copper as possible.Nomvula Thulo, a member of the mayoral committee for basic services, said the municipality was aware of the damage caused by the izinyoka and would prevent future damage. Captain Fikile Funda confirmed that seven men were arrested and will appear in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court soon. “A total of seven suspects were caught with hacksaws, pliers and side cutters. They were charged with theft,” he said.
