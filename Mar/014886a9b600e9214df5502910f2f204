TAXI drivers are complaining that municipal workers have left rubbish at their rank, making it difficult for them to do their work. The drivers from Mzamomhle, in East London, told Daily Sun Buffalo City metro workers said the municipal workers arrived on Thursday to pick up the rubbish but left some behind. &ldquo;We were shocked after they left and thought maybe they would come back to collect more but we were wrong.&ldquo;The rubbish is still lying there,&rdquo; said one of the taxi drivers.When the workers were approached by the SunTeam, they said they would not collect rubbish that had not been put into plastic bags as that wasn&rsquo;t their job. The taxi drivers were not the only ones unhappy with the state of the rank.Hawkers who sell fruit and meat in the area said they were finding it hard to cope with the smell.They said it also chased their customers away.Municipal spokesman Sibusiso Cindi said they encouraged residents to put rubbish into plastic bags for safety reasons.Cindi said the rule was meant to safeguard the health and safety of staff as some of the things thrown out were hazardous. &ldquo;Residents must put out their rubbish on the days set aside for it to be collected,&rdquo; he said, adding that someone would be sent to the taxi rank to deal with the situation.
