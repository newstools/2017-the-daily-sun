TAXI wars have been a curse in many areas of Mzansi, with blood quickly flowing when disputes arise. But two taxi associations from Mdantsane in East London, Eastern Cape, are doing things differently. District taxi association Melta and the Uncedo association have decided to share the same route and live in peace! The two organisations held a meeting in Parkside, East London on Tuesday to map the way forward. Melta chairman Gabs Mtshala told Daily Sun that Melta was joining Uncedo as a new member. &ldquo;But Melta is not coming to an end. We are going to continue using our name under Uncedo.&rdquo; He admitted violence had taken place recently. &ldquo;Yes, there was violent reaction in our organisation when some people would not accept defeat in our elections held some months ago. &ldquo;They decided to turn to violence. Our aim in joining Uncedo is to move forward and forget about the fights of the past. &ldquo;Now we think about the future of the people. Fighting cannot take us anywhere. We are very happy to work with Uncedo,&rdquo; Mtshala said. Uncedo president Ntsikelelo Gaehler told Daily Sun it was not difficult for them to accept Melta. &ldquo;They had some problems with other people in the industry and we wanted to make sure we help. &ldquo;When they have problems, they can take them up with their mother body.&rdquo; Gaehler also admitted that Uncedo members were involved in taxi violence that has been troubling Mthatha. &ldquo;The situation is calm after we sat down and spoke,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The problem was that members of our organisation were not allowed to transport people to Libode, even though they were from Libode. &ldquo;The Border Alliance Taxi Association allows only people from Durban to take people from Libode elsewhere.&rdquo;
