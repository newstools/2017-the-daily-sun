Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana has explained that he enjoys being called crazy for attempting to score from distance with thunderbolt shots.During the course of his glittering career, the Mamelodi Sundowns and Bafana Bafana destroyer has banged in a catalgoue of spectacular strikes.Notably, he fired home an incredible goal against Cameroon in March last year for Bafana which saw him nominated for the prestigious Fifa Puskas Award.As such, he told SuperSport of his long range attempts: "The thing is I used to score when I was young so now it is something I like to do. To people, it looks crazy because even my friends say I am crazy.&ldquo;I agree I am crazy. Nobody would think of scoring from that far but I have done it and for me, it looks normal because I have done it before. It is something that I will forever try to do even if people do not find it normal."Those goals reflect my character because my teammates especially allow me to do that because they understand the person that I am. They call me crazy. It is normal and I accept that I can do that and they allow me to do that and attempt from that distance."
