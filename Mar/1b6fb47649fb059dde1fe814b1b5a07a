AN OFF-DUTY doctor who stopped to help victims of a serious road accident in Zimbabwe was hit by a lorry and both his legs were broken, a press report says.The doctor, named by the official Herald newspaper as Samuel Mvurume, is being treated in hospital in Harare.Crowds had gathered in the aftermath of an accident involving a minibus near Chinhoyi in northern Zimbabwe at the weekend. The bus hit a tree and 23 people were injured, the paper said.Mvurume got out to help the accident victims but was hit by a truck.The Herald said: "It is suspected that the driver of the truck.. panicked after seeing hordes of people by the roadside."Zimbabweans complain that the heavy presence of police at fine-seeking roadblocks has done little to bring down the high incidence of traffic accidents in the country.Earlier this month 15 people were killed near Bulawayo in a horrific accident blamed on a pothole. It's estimated that five people die in road crashes in Zimbabwe daily.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/doctor-who-stopped-to-help-crash-victims-hit-by-truck-20170329
