THERE was celebration at the Constitutional Court yesterday when student leader, Bonginkosi Khanyile was released on bail.The EFF student command leader from KZN had been in jail for six months after his arrest for participating in the #FeesMustFall protests.His mum, Phumzile Khathini told Daily Sun she was over the moon that her son would finally be sleeping at home again.&ldquo;These judges have restored by faith in the justice system. I had lost hope. He didn&rsquo;t kill anyone. All he did was fight for free education for every poor child,&rdquo; she said.EFF leader, Julius Malema said Khanyile was arrested for fighting for a just cause.&ldquo;When I visited him in January I made a commitment on behalf of the EFF leadership that we would do everything in our power to get him out of jail,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I even made a commitment that we would assemble the best legal minds to get him out and we lived by that commitment.&rdquo;After around four hours of arguments, state Advocate Andy Bester said they had realised the facts of the case had changed and the state had no objections to Khanyile being granted bail. It was set at R250.Bester came to an agreement with Khanyile&rsquo;s advocates, Dali Mpofu and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi that he may not intimidate staff or security personnel at Durban University of Technology and he may not obstruct the police.Mpofu told the court Khanyile&rsquo;s continued presence behind bars infringed his right to liberty. He said Khanyile had been labelled a ring leader in the protests but there was no evidence before the court to suggest this was the case.He said despite writing his exams in jail, Khanyile had passed all four of his subjects with distinctions.
