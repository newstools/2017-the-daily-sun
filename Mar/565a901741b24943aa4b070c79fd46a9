VANESSA Charles had no choice but to apply tough love. This week, after years of allegedly being terrorised by her 28-year-old son, she opened a case of malicious damage to property against him.“I can’t take it anymore. It breaks my heart to see my child turning into a monster.” He has turned my life into a living hell by insulting me or beating me up. If he is not beating me, he vandalises my house. I had no choice but to call the police to deal this boy.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstIDBToEJ5Q8FUbRXkpoAJj8DmiHuwOU_px-naIKoVsUyDU66ylhFze0sN3Q1kDdgczo8V-MwyfttgT7hrtfa-LPbcCT8gHK6QpuksDpAg5kVXKXICD-cWsxUXbcMFdiMf2wubwlM_VH8C3jPmVTuHFqawi3T6CeLVPYRLYjrz7wpw4Xr2PkgOd_lAZ5dRH3f4Edetm1pkWBKeAbTuVWJTbJ-ccihKV58v-7rKGlSkSRpgXaLO9MGL0gxrzHz5VMWkCTEeEkFzAynsmimIFxCJOC_mMVDY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzI9Qmi7_gdtEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He has stripped my house of everything I’ve worked hard for. He steals everything he can get his hands on, from my TV and furniture to plates and pots. “He even stole his own child’s clothes and stroller.”Vanessa said they are forced to lock everything away when he is around, including cutlery. “Now he is going around telling people that he is selling my house,” claimed a devastated Vanessa.She said her son was a sweet, quiet person while growing up. He loved sport and spent most of his time playing cricket.“When his father died all that changed. He hung around with the wrong crowd and started using nyaope. From then on, everything went downhill and the family is affected the most.” Daily Sun contacted Captain Aubrey Moopeloa, an SAPS spokesman, who confirmed that the suspect has been arrested. He said a case of malicious damage to property had been opened against him.
