Bidvest Wits take on Al Ahly on Saturday in what is sure to be a hard fought first round CAF Champions League contest in Cairo at the Al Salam Stadium.Star midfielder Xola Mlambo believes that experience can help his team in the game. He told the club's official website, "We have players who have been in the game for some time, players who have faced Al Ahly before &ndash; the likes of Daine Klate, Moeneeb Josephs and Sifiso Myeni."They have been there. They make everyone's job easier. They have shared their experiences with all of us. It will be a good experience to go to Al Ahly and I am sure whoever will be left behind will be disappointed."Meanwhile, coach Gavin Hunt has admitted no fear at facing the Egyptian giants. He told&nbsp;IOL: "They are a big institution, and not just a football club. And the players have been looking forward to this game for some time, which is nice for a change because we all know that generally that is not the case."I am not sure how we are going to react, but to win this would be great for this club because we have to create that type of mentality in South Africa, that we want to play in these tournaments."
