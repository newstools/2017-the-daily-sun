WHEN they graduated with their national Educare diplomas, the students were full of hope about finding employment at creches and primary schools.Now the graduates claim they have been turned down. . . one by one. And they want to know from the Umfolozi TVET college why their qualifications appear to be worthless.Yesterday, unemployed graduates and current students staged a protest action outside KwaSithebe Campus in Mandeni, northern KZN.They said after spending three years studying it has become an uphill battle to get jobs.Graduate Ntombifikile Mkhungo (27) said the qualification allowed them to teach children six years and younger either at a creche or in grade R. &ldquo;But when we apply for a job, creche owners and schools don&rsquo;t take us. This has been happening since 2013,&rdquo; she claimed.Third year student and president of the Student Representative Council, Vusumuzi Nene (40) said several attempts have been made to get the college to listen to the students&rsquo; complaints and give answers.&ldquo;The college has not done anything to assist but just keeps enrolling new students every year,&rdquo; he said.College spokesman Bhekani Ndlovu said the institution&rsquo;s management and student representatives are still in talks on the matter. He dismissed claims that the Educare qualification wasn&rsquo;t up to scratch.&ldquo;The programmes we offer are approved by the Department of Higher Education and Training. We will take the students&rsquo; complaints to the department.&rdquo; Ndlovu added that students might be confusing the Educare diploma with the professional teaching qualification from the university.
