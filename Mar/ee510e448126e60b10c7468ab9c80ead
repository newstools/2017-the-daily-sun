MABALA NOISE boss, Reggy &ldquo; The Govner&rdquo; Nkabinde, has hit back at his haters.&nbsp;The ANCYL treasurer says he wants to set the record straight about the success of his company at the Metro FM Music Awards.&nbsp;Last week, Mabala Noise scooped seven awards, and some posters on social media accused Reggy of vote rigging.&nbsp;The Metro FM Awards trended on social media three days after the ceremony, as calls for an investigation into the voting system and winners grew louder.At the time, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said: &ldquo;The SABC isn&rsquo;t really concerned, and insists that the rules were made clear from the start. The voting was audited by an external company and we were informed of the winners on the day, except for the Song of the Year category, which saw votes close on the night of the awards.&rdquo;Reggy said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t buy votes or involve ourselves in corrupt activities.&nbsp;&lsquo;We had an aggressive voting campaign and we didn&rsquo;t rely only on social network hype.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t control the voting system. It was done through networks with an SMS line that was provided to all of us in the industry.&rdquo;&nbsp;He went on to say: &ldquo;AKA, Cassper and Emtee won more than three awards last year &ndash; and people never said the awards were rigged.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think something is not right out there. I&rsquo;m a revolutionary who understands values of society.&nbsp;&ldquo;I chose this industry a long time ago. And I&rsquo;m passionate about it. The awards had nothing to do with leadership &ndash; it&rsquo;s about music!&rdquo;&nbsp;He went on to say: &ldquo;You do something that has nothing to do with government and tenders &ndash; and they say you&rsquo;re still wrong.&nbsp;&ldquo;For me, people are playing cheap politics,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The ANCYL music mogul added: &ldquo;Mabala Noise is the only independent young black record company that is positioning young SA talent to be world superstars.&nbsp;&ldquo;The majors couldn&rsquo;t do this for our people for years. They have never produced an international superstar in Mzansi &ndash; because they never saw it necessary to invest in the African child.&rdquo;&nbsp;
