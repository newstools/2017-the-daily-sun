LAST week, Livhuwani Mudau (23) would have started upgrading her matric results to study teaching next year.But Home Affairs says she shares her ID with someone in Soweto. The college in Fourways told her to come back with the correct ID.“I can’t realise my dream because of incompetent officials,” she said.Livhuwani came to Daily Sun in Auckland Park, Joburg, with her aunt Sonia Mudau (31) for help.“I think it’s a must for officials to fix the problem not caused by me.”Sonia told Daily Sun: “Livhuwani’s mum, who is in Venda, asked me to accompany her. This started in 2015, when she applied for an ID in Louis Trichardt, Limpopo.”Livhuwani added: “In grade 11, I was asked to fill in late registration of birth forms and reapply. I even got calls from shops to say that I owed them.”Gauteng Home Affairs spokesman Mayihlome Tshwete said: “We’ll send someone to investigate.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssWCM6jTIhtzQ5gMyY643fmK-EbOjcj3SCaulC69opcfrCoI3wBdswHCjNQ-SQpcL0Dc9nutXg5EgWxz-xZQLemn4ZqXHtp5-yjMdtZz1L1Cx9ztYoCfyd1Q15MmmSUZUmQqhbJEPjFO_F_o3aohcyyF7W2_05lzZnKLKsNnrPF1XHvnjq77bAU6c6XkoeYUXHUnLcSNC4KIs_06bbSSLPpPb5Yn6d2ezKDL0GFgP-DFjbbditvnfuQapzRX5Oqx398qAq_NjytocoOKlyxTaxgzQwWDTg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKLnVgH1WuPpEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
