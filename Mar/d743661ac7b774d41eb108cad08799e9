SMANGELE Mbuyisa was waiting for her son to come home when tragedy struck. He arrived with a bullet wound in his throat and died the next day! The mum from Etwatwa East, Ekurhuleni said her son Sifiso (26) was shot on the street on 11 February and died at Far East Rand Hospital. The 49-year-old mum said since that day she had not been able to sleep peacefully. She said she often smelled her son&rsquo;s blood and felt as if there was a bullet in her own neck. &ldquo;The last time I saw him he was in hospital with a bullet in his throat. He was speaking to me normally and even walked me out when it was time for me to go home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The next morning I was told he had died. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was hearing. Since then my life has been a living hell. It feels like the bullet is in me now. I need help.&rdquo; Smangele said she believed the pain her son experienced before his death had been transferred to her. His death remains a mystery as he was shot by unknown men and nothing was stolen. &ldquo;The bullet must have had something evil on it. Now I&rsquo;m left with this pain and I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; Etwatwa police confirmed that a case of murder was being investigated.
