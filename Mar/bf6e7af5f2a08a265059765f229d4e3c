DURBAN&rsquo;s popular beaches remain closed after wild waves sent beach-goers running for cover on Sunday.The incident, which saw three people being treated for near drowning, also caused millions of rands in damage.Added to the monster waves making swimming a big &ldquo;no&rdquo;, shark nets have also reportedly shifted, meaning the scary killers can come closer to the shoreline.Thembinkosi Ngcobo, head of parks and recreation in the eThekwini municipality, announced the closure of the Durban beachfront yesterday. Giant waves on Sunday splashed over the promenade, reaching the swimming pool area as well as restaurants situated in the beach area.Ngcobo said the closure was to ensure that visitors were safe until the high tide had passed. He urged residents to stay away from beaches as it still was not safe to swim.&ldquo;Nets blocking the sharks have also moved a little from where they had been placed. This could increase the possibility of sharks coming near the shoreline.&ldquo;We ask residents to stay away,&rdquo; Ngcobo said. Nomfundo Mzobe (39) from Inanda, north of Durban, told Daily Sun it would take her a while before she would go back to the beach, after what she had seen. &ldquo;I had taken my two daughters, aged five and 10, to cool off. &ldquo;I had told my daughters to get out of the pool and go to the grass area so that we could eat, moments before the waves struck. I thank God that we were not on the spot when it happened,&rdquo; said Nomfundo.Ngcobo said the damage amounted to millions, and residents would be notified when it was safe to visit the beach.&ldquo;Luckily there were no fatalities or drownings,&rdquo; he said.
