A PROTEST by unemployed residents kept entrances and roads leading to the Samancor chrome mine blocked for a second day yesterday. The protest started on Wednesday morning when residents made it clear they wanted to be employed at the mine or operations would be shut down. The entrance to the mine in Mooinooi outside Brits, North West was blocked with burning tyres, wood and rocks. Residents said management had only one choice: give them jobs or close down! Police kept a watchful eye. On Wednesday leaders of the Modderspruit and Mooinooi Unemployment Forum held a meeting with mine management, but no agreement was reached. The protesters then went on to block the N4 from Pretoria to Rustenburg. Forum chairman Thabo Shilenge said the mine had previously promised to employ 800 people, half from Mooinooi and half from Modderspruit, but instead had hired people from Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Sunel Pretorius, corporate manager at the mine, said her senior manager was at the meeting and it was he who had to approve any response to Daily Sun.
