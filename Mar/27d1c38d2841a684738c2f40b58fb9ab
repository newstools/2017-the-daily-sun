NOMPUMELELO Sithole (28) was sleeping peacefully in bed in the early hours of yesterday. When she suddenly woke up surrounded by a thick dust cloud, she thought the shack had collapsed . . . And she realised the fridge had landed on top of her &ndash; and that a taxi was parked in the shack!Luckily, the strong woman was not hurt and she pushed the heavy fridge off her bed.&ldquo;The taxi&rsquo;s front lights were still on,&rdquo; Nompumelelo told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&ldquo;I wanted to ask the driver what had happened, but he wasn&rsquo;t in the taxi. I still have questions. Thank God I wasn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo; Nompumelelo&rsquo;s brother Oscar Shibunda (31), who owns the shack in Alexandra, north of Joburg, said the taxi was still parked inside when he arrived.&ldquo;Neighbours know the owner of the taxi,&rdquo; said Oscar. &ldquo;They phoned him to come and fetch it.&rdquo; He said the taxi owner had agreed to fix the shack. They did not open a case at the cop shop.
