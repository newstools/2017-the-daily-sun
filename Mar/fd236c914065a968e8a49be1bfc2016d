HE WAS supposed to collect discarded cardboard boxes and make a model house for a school project, and then get a mark for it.But Jabu Kabini took it a step further. He made a career out of it. He no longer gets marks but cash in return.The 26-year-old from Phola Park near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga not only builds model houses, but is also a sought-after draughtsman with offices in Pretoria and KwaMhlanga.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I wanted to study architecture after I completed matric, but I did not have the money. I decided to continue building model houses, and started my own company, Designed Dream House. &ldquo;With the little money I earned, I bought the tools I needed and learnt all the skills I needed on the job.&rdquo; He started by designing small houses and people loved his work. His business continues to grow as he now designs big structures and has passed on his skill to his younger brother, Boy.&ldquo;I still collect card boxes and make model houses,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I advertise my business on the model houses, so it is a two-pronged approach and works wonders. &ldquo;Some people who bought the model houses come back and request plans for the same house I had built using card boxes.&rdquo;Jabu said his dream was to design malls and other big structures.
