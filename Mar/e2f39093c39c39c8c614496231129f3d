The minibus was shaking so badly that I decided to pull over to check what was going on.“I was shocked when I saw the bonnet was open and a cable was hanging on it.” There was still life in the cable as it continued to spark, sending chills down Lucas’ spine.He said it left him feeling shocked when he realised what could have happened to him and the children.The cable alegedly fell from a big transformer that supplies houses in the area with power.“I managed to keep the kids in the taxi while I thought about what to do next.” He then called the police, who in turn informed Eskom.Parent Mmabatho Seoketsa (38) said she was standing with her nine-year-old son, waiting for the taxi to arrive, when she heard an unusual noise.“It sounded like thunder – I thought heavy rain was coming, or that maybe it was a gunshot.” City of Tshwane spokesman Lindela Mashigo said a team of technicians was sent to investigate and put the loose cable back in place.“Customers are urged to report illegal connections or power outages to Eskom on 08600 37566. “They can also send an SMS and their account or meter number to 35328.”
