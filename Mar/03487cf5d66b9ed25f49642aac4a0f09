GOGO Jakobe Gumede (71) was lucky to escape unharmed when her one-roomed shack was burnt down by a veld fire on Tuesday.The 71-year-old woman from Ndlondlweni Village at Manguzi in uMhlabuyalingana, northern KZN, is grateful to be alive but is worried that she now lives like a hobo. All her belongings, including important documents, were burnt to ashes.&ldquo;Since the day of the incident, life has been very difficult for me. I sleep and eat in my neighbours&rsquo; homes. I am old and I suffer from arthritis. I spend most of my time in bed,&rdquo; she said.Gogo Jakobe said she was resting in her yard when she suddenly saw a huge flame being blown by the wind onto the roof of her reed shack. &ldquo;Before I could get a bucket of water to put out the fire, the entire shack was engulfed in smoke and huge blazes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was just watching when my shack eventually collapsed to the ground. Because I feared that I would not be able to run fast, I did not attempt to get into the house to save some of my belongings.&ldquo;I would appreciate every little help that I can get right now. &ldquo;It may be a new shack, blankets, clothes, money or food. My children died a long time ago and I live alone.&rdquo; Umhlabuyalingana Local Municipality mayor Nkululeko Mthethwa said a team from the disaster management unit was working on gogo&rsquo;s problem.&ldquo;They will gather details and see how she can be assisted,&rdquo; she said.KZN cops said they had no knowledge of the incident.
