EASTERN Cape is the poorer province when compared to Gauteng.But Gauteng Premier David Makhura has asked the skilful Pepi Silinga, CEO of Coega Development Corporation, to join his panel of advisors. Silinga has been successful in attracting global investors to the Coega Industrial Development Zone in Port Elizabeth. Silinga will guide the economic development of the Gauteng provincial government. He will be serving the city of gold for the next two years. Silinga forms part of 14 members of the premier&rsquo;s economic advisory panel. The announcement was made last month during the state of the province address by Makhura. &ldquo;The panel will advise the premier&rsquo;s office on strategies needed to increase job creation. &ldquo;The members will help increase the province&rsquo;s exports and an all-round inclusive growth programme which is in line with the National Development Plan.&rdquo; This appointment came as the Coega Industrial Zone gears up to start the construction of the Beijing Automobile International Corporation. Ayanda Vilakazi, the company&rsquo;s spokesman, confirmed that their CEO had been handpicked to form part of the Gauteng premier&rsquo;s economic advisory panel. &ldquo;Our award-winning company is a leader in the economic industrial and infrastructure of South Africa. &ldquo;Pepi Silinga will be a worthy addition to the panel of 14 members, as well to the Gauteng provincial government. &ldquo;We have no doubt he will use his skills effectively in bringing the province economic and infrastructure development.&rdquo; Silinga who is a professionally registered civil engineer, was recognised in 2014 with the Council Prestige Award from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University.
