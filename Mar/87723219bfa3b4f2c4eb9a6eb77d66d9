PEE on this tree if you want your 4-5 to grow!This was the instruction a so called herbalist gave 13 young boys after he allegedly lured them to a mountain.But things went horribly wrong . . . the boys&rsquo; private parts began itching! They told their parents about the trees and how the man had also allegedly fondled their 4-5s. Community leader Sizwe Hlatshwayo said the boys, aged nine to 12, from Delmore squatter camp in Ekurhuleni were lured to the bush while they were playing on Saturday. The kids told their parents that after the man had touched them, he proceeded to plant a tree for each of them, ordering them to pee on it every day without fail. The boys said he warned them that they would become blind if they failed to follow the instruction. They said they did as they were told out of fear, but as the days went by, their 4-5s started itching and they told their parents. Angry parents went to hunt down the 27-year-old man. They threatened to moer him and he took them to the mountain where he had planted the trees.They ordered the man to uproot and destroy the trees.Residents wanted to necklace him but he was saved by the cops.Reiger Park police spokesman Constable Mashudu Phathela said the man was arrested and faces sexual assault charges.
