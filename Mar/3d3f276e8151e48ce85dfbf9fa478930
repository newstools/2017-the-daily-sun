RESIDENTS of Bhekindabazakho in Mabopane, Tshwane, were happy when a church was built in their kasi in 2015.They thought it would be nice to live near a place of worship, but they are now singing a different tune. They have claimed that Mountain Transfiguration Church congregants make a lot of noise during their services, which are held in a large shack. When the church first started, they said, it held peaceful services on Sundays and Wednesdays. But its services now drag on until midnight during the week, and the music band makes unbearable noise. The residents, who now want the church to leave their area, said attempts to get cops and Metro cops to intervene has failed.They voiced out their concerns to church members last Tuesday and Wednesday at a meeting where the SunTeam was kicked out. They said church members had accused them of passing the buck and failing to confront tavern owners, who apparently also play loud music.Kgomotso Manamela (52), who stays opposite the church, said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have peace of mind anymore. They disturb our kids when they are studying. Their music is so loud we can&rsquo;t even hear when thugs break into our homes.&rdquo;He said church members had agreed at the meeting to keep it down. &ldquo;As soon as we left they turned the volume even higher.&rdquo;The church pastor, who is only known as Motumba, said the SunTeam, had it been present at the meeting, would have known what agreements were reached. He refused to say why the team was thrown out.Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, a Metro police spokesman, said Daily Sun should send him questions, which he would forward to the Department of Environmental Affairs for investigation.
