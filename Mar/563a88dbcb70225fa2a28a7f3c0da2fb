SAFA has apparently not given up hope of acquiring the services of Stuart Baxter or Herve Renard for the vacant Bafana Bafana coaching post, according to highly placed sources.It is believed that Safa president Danny Jordaan is now running the hunt for the new Bafana coach alone and is no longer interacting with the committee originally tasked with appointing a new mentor.According to SunSport&rsquo;s source, Renard was approached by Jordaan again. But indications are that the Morocco coach wants to bring in his own technical team, which is against Safa policy because of the strain it could put on the association&rsquo;s budget.The source said the interest in Baxter was so great that Safa was willing to buy out his contract with SuperSport United, a move that Matsatsantsa a Pitori chief executive Stan Matthews said they would not entertain.The Bafana coaching hunt has apparently split Safa executives, as some believe their opinions are not being taken into consideration. Even Safa CEO Dennis Mumble has apparently lost interest in helping recruit a new coach.Jordaan has promised to announce the new coach this week but only after tonight&rsquo;s friendly against Angola, as he said they didn&rsquo;t want to distract Owen Da Gama&rsquo;s camp. Jordaan gave the impression that they already had their man &ndash; all that was left was the big reveal to the media before the end of the week.However, our mole believes no documents have been signed yet: &ldquo;I could be wrong, as the president is running things solo in this case. But I have been reliably told that a coach has been identified and that there are certain issues to clear up before contracts are signed.&rdquo;Another informant said: &ldquo;Owen must just be given an opportunity to take charge until the end of the year to avoid buying out a contract, which would be costly for Safa.&rdquo;Some people have not been convinced by Bafana&rsquo;s win against Guinea-Bissau, which came thanks to two penalties and one goal.&ldquo;For now it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess who Jordaan will appoint and whether the executives will approve him or not,&rdquo; a source said.
