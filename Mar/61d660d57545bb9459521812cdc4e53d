MAMELODI police are looking for a false prophet. The man targets pupils and takes their money and cellphones, claiming it is a prophecy. He allegedly targets youth by prophesying about things affecting their family lives. His latest victim is Tshepo Nyalunga (16) of Mamelodi West, Tshwane. On Friday, Tshepo&rsquo;s grandparents sent him to Menlyn Mall and he met the prophet at a taxi rank. He said the man asked him if he knew the directions to Pretoria University. &ldquo;He asked if I could spare him a few minutes and I agreed, not knowing it would be the greatest mistake of my life. &ldquo;He started by telling me about a car accident in 2014 I was involved in. He said I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to have survived. He then said my older sister who has been applying for work but would never succeed until he can pray for all our cellphones and laptops.&rdquo; Tshepo said the man also told him his mum would die in three days. Tshepo said after that he felt he couldn&rsquo;t control anything he did. &ldquo;I agreed with everything he told me, even though I felt it was wrong.&rdquo; He said the next thing, they were at home and the man asked him to go inside and fetch all the cellphones and a laptop and bring them to him. &ldquo;I left him by the gate and went inside. When I asked my madala to give me his phones, he refused but when the prophet came in, he just pointed to where they were.&rdquo; The man said he wanted to pray for them. While praying, he disappeared. &ldquo;He just vanished. We didn&rsquo;t even hear him start his car.&rdquo; Captain Johannes Maheso said a lot of people have fallen victim to the false prophet. He said people should block their cellphones and laptops that were taken. Anyone who knows the whereabouts of the prophet should immediately contact the police. &ldquo;Any victims should also come to the station to open cases,&rdquo; said Maheso.
