The Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) will visit 60 000 South Africans to request their participation in the country&rsquo;s fifth HIV and Health study. A total of 72 teams of trained field workers, dressed in HSRC-branded bibs and carrying council-issued identification cards, will be interviewing a total of 60 000 people of all ages from random households in towns, cities and villages across the entire country. Professor Leickness Simbayi, deputy CEO for research at the research council and overall principal investigator of the study, said participation was voluntary but it was important for as many people to take part in order for the results to be representative of the whole country.Early assessments indicate that the survey, which started in two of the provinces in December and last month, is going well.&ldquo;A month into the study, more than 1 000 households have agreed to participate, which is very encouraging.&ldquo;By the end of the study an estimated 22 000 households are expected to have taken part in the study. Field workers have noted challenges in accessing some houses in some neighbourhoods &ndash; particularly in the suburbs.&rdquo;The 2017 HIV and Health Study is the fifth in a series of surveys undertaken by the council every few years. &ldquo;This year, field workers are using more efficient electronic data-collection devices,&rdquo; said Simbaya.The study will identify the prevalence of social factors and dangerous behaviours that put South Africans at risk of contracting the virus, which includes determining the HIV status of participants, the number of people who were recently affected, determine who is taking antiretroviral medicine and assessing the level of resistance to ARVs by those already on the treatment.
