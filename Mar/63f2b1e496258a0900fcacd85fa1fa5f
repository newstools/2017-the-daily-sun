FOR years, the gogo (81) hoped her son would bring home a makoti. But when he told her he would pay lobola this weekend, the gogo&rsquo;s happiness lasted for only a minute.The gogo from Qweqwe Village in Mthatha, Eastern Cape heard her future makoti used to be a magosha.She allegedly hired thieves to steal the cows, sheep and pigs her son was going to use for lobola.But yesterday when she was caught with a stolen pig on the back of a bakkie, she immediately confessed.&ldquo;I spent lots of money sending my son to university, and I raised him as a church person. I can&rsquo;t allow him to bring me a magosha makoti,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I was supposed to be happy with the news that I will now become a mamazala, but I just feel sick.&rdquo;She said the other gogos in the village have already started making fun of her and her magosha makoti. Gogo&rsquo;s son (36) told the SunTeam his mum has always been a bully.&ldquo;She always tried to control me. She forced me to study medicine while I was passionate about fashion design,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Everyone in life deserves a second chance. I love my wife-to-be. I don&rsquo;t care about her past.&rdquo;He said he caught his mum trying to sell the pig for R150 from the back of her bakkie.He said two years ago he was his future wife&rsquo;s client, but now she will be his wife.&ldquo;I was tempted to open a case but my uncle and wife-to-be told me to forgive her. The lobola ceremony will take place as planned, whether my mum likes it or not.&rdquo;A fruit seller from Penuel Village spotted the gogo trying to sell the pig in town.He immediately called her son, who rushed to town with his two uncles to stop the gogo&rsquo;s sale.The gogo admitted she wanted to sell the pig, but said she did it to protecther son.
