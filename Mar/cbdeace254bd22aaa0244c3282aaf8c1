AN ANGRY group of people almost burnt a woman to death on Saturday night.They accused her of being a fake sangoma who ruined marriages. It happened in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage. Among the crowd were NoAmen Sizila (45) and Nokwanele Ndletyana (50). They shouted: &ldquo;She must voetsek from our kasi! We don&rsquo;t want horny sangomas here!&rdquo; Nokwanele said she first met the sangoma in 2013 after being introduced to her by her gogo. &ldquo;She said she needed a place to live and I felt sorry for her because she had a small child. I let her have an outside room, but she soon started flirting with my husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She told people I had sex with men in a toilet at my sister&rsquo;s house in 2015, leading to fights with my husband. I ended up kicking her out of the house.&rdquo;NoAmen said she also rented a shack to the woman, who soon started causing trouble. &ldquo;She told me a tokoloshe wanted to poke me, and my husband would leave me.&rdquo;When Daily Sun tried to talk to the sangoma, she ran away. Captain Gerda Swart said: &ldquo;People should be careful of fake sangomas. We also appeal to the residents not to take the law into their own hands.&rdquo;
