MAPASEKA &ldquo;Speedster&rdquo; Makhanya says she has become stronger since roping in Jean Verster as her coach. Makhanya is hoping to see the effects of her new training regime when the Spar Women&rsquo;s Challenge kicks off at the Green Point Common Fields of Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. The starter&rsquo;s gun goes off at 7.30am. She believes she is stronger now than she has been in the past two years during which she was plagued by injury. The Spar Grand Prix prize money of R173 000, which has been increased from R150 000, will give added motivation to the middle distance runners. Makhanya, who has been appointed as a patron of the Challenge alongside Rene Kalmer, said she would not pressure herself for a result in the first leg. She said as a patron she would need to lead by example, while Kalmer is on diaper duty as she gave birth to her daughter just 12 days ago. Kalmer said she would likely be back for the Durban leg of the competition in June. Said Makhanya: &ldquo;I am not at my fittest but I&rsquo;m certainly better than I was in 2015 and 2016. I am nervous about the race because I plan to prove that I can do better.&rdquo; Speedster is now based in Potchefstroom where she trains with Verster, who is also Olympic Games gold medallist Caster Semenya&rsquo;s coach. &ldquo;I had trained by myself for two years. I feel stronger than before because Jean pays attention to things I often don&rsquo;t notice. Being based in Potchefstroom is also motivation that I have to do better &ndash; I had to leave my daughter at home and doing well will be a reward for the sacrifice!&rdquo; Although Makhanya is happy that runners can now collect more points on the added Pietermaritzburg leg, she wished it could have been set for July. &ldquo;The gap between the Pretoria and Pietermaritzburg leg is small. Running two big races in a month can be difficult but it&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to get used to,&rdquo; she said.
