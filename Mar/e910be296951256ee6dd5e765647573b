DIRECTOR General at Treasury, Lungisa Fuzile says they still don't know why President Jacob Zuma cancelled their investment roadshow.Fuzile was speaking to journalists outside of Luthuli House, following finance minister Pravin Gordhan being spotted on the 6th floor inside the building earlier.Gordhan arrived back in South Africa this morning and went straight to the ANC headquarters and is believed to be locked in a meeting with ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe.Speculation has grown over the past 24 hours that his head is on the chopping block. Some ANC insiders close to President Jacob Zuma have said that "a long overdue cabinet reshuffle" would take place before end of the week."There has been speculation for a very long time. In my case I don't work with speculation I work with realities," said Fuzile. He refused to give details behind his presence at Luthuli House except to say he was meeting with friends at the ANC headquarters.Fuzile said the investor roadshow went well. "We met around 50 investors and two credit ratings agencies," he said.The treasury DG jokingly added that he didn't mind the urgent recall from the roadshow. "I love home hey, you must always know I love home and with me, I can't wait to get to the farm," said Fuzile.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/still-no-clarity-over-why-finance-minister-was-recalled-from-the-uk-20170328
