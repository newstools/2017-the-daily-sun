But now the family from Nongoma, KZN is angry and want nothing to do with the man. The cows were stolen!The woman&rsquo;s aunt said shame was brought on their family when the real owner claimed his cows. They had been stolen in Mtubatuba. &ldquo;We no longer want that man as our son-in-law. We can&rsquo;t trust the cows he brings in future,&rdquo; she said.Cattle owner Patrick Zikhali (40) said he was grateful to his ancestors for helping him find his missing animals.&ldquo;I will slaughter one of the cows and invite the entire Nkodibe Village to celebrate with me,&rdquo; he said.He told Daily Sun his 13 cows were stolen at the beginning of last month.&ldquo;I was relieved when anti-crime organisation Isikebhe called me and said my cows had been spotted.&ldquo;I found eight cows at a house in St Lucia and five in Nongoma, where a suspect had paid lobola with them.&rdquo; Attempts to find the man and his girlfriend were unsuccessful.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said three suspects were arrested and appeared in the Mtubatuba Magistrates Court last week. They were denied bail and will appear again tomorrow on a charge of stock theft.
