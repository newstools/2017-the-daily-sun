England international goalkeeper Joe Hart cannot see a second chance for himself at Manchester City next season.The 29-year-old was a surprise casualty of Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s changes at the Etihad at the start of the season, resulting in the goalkeeper joining Serie A outfit Torino on a season-long loan.Replacement Claudio Bravo has failed to justify Guardiola&rsquo;s decision, and the ex-Barcelona stopper has since lost his place in City&rsquo;s starting eleven.But despite Bravo&rsquo;s struggles, Hart doesn&rsquo;t see a future for himself at City and expects to be on the move at the conclusion of his time at Torino.&ldquo;I've got to be realistic. I love that club and I've always said that as long as they wanted me, I would be there,&rdquo; he told the&nbsp;BBC.&ldquo;But I was always cautious when I said that because I'm aware that at the big, big clubs stuff can change quickly, as can opinions and people in charge.&ldquo;Not everyone is going to like you, not everyone is going to want to play you and that's the business side of it, which I've grown into and I'm certainly not going to take personally.&ldquo;I want to play football, I love to play football so if that opportunity is not going to be given there then I'm going to have to look elsewhere and may have to make somewhere else my home.&rdquo;Hart has been linked with moves to several other Premier League outfits over the course of the campaign - including Liverpool - but he is not certain to return to England.He added: &ldquo;I love the Premier League, I absolutely love Premier League games. Removing myself a footballer, I watch the Premier League. It's a great league, fantastic football is played in it.&ldquo;I know it really well but I wouldn't say it was top of my wish list. Top of my wish list is to play for a club that wants me to be their goalkeeper.&rdquo;
