THEY said he took their roof, so they took his car! He allegedly tried to steal back his car one night but the community chased him away and removed the car&rsquo;s wheels. Since then, the car has been at the Tshiedana family home in Chiawelo, Soweto. &ldquo;He must bring back our roof and we will give him back his car,&rdquo; said a family spokesman. The feud started on 8 March, when Nicholas Nnditsheni told the Tshiedana family that he had bought their house and they should move out. They refused and he left. But days later, when they were away, he allegedly came with a group of men and stripped off the roof. Neighbours say they were shocked when they saw men loading the roof onto a truck. They quickly alerted gogo Magnet Tshiedana (65). But when she arrived, the men were gone. The following day, said the neighbours, Nicholas drove back and told the Tshiedana family to move out. That&rsquo;s when he was cornered by the community, and his car was taken. Gogo Magnet said she doesn&rsquo;t know who Nicholas bought the house from because it&rsquo;s a family house which is not for sale. &ldquo;When we ask him, he gives us the runaround. He doesn&rsquo;t even have proof but he wants us out. We are going nowhere,&rdquo; she said. Nicholas claimed he has proof that he bought the house. He said he removed the roof because he wants to build a bigger house.
