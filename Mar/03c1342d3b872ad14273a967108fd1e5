WHAT was supposed to be a peaceful march against crime and poor service delivery turned ugly yesterday. Almost 2 000 angry residents from Olievenhoutbosch in Tshwane ended up burning tyres and wood on the R55. Metro cops, the police tactical response team and a police helicopter were soon at the scene. Public transport and private cars were not allowed on the road, so schoolchildren could not go to school. SACP regional chairman Solly Thabathe said crime had increased in the area: &ldquo;We are tired of crime and the police are doing little to help. A few months ago, special police were sent here, but crime has been on the rise since they left. We want them back. &ldquo;Another problem is the allocation of RDP houses in Extension 27. There allegedly has been corruption and we need government to investigate.&rdquo; Resident Brian Ndlovu (65) said they were tired of being ignored. &ldquo;We need those houses and better service delivery for our children,&rdquo; said Ndlovu. A group of people went to Extension 27, where the new RDP houses were recently allocated.They demanded to see proof that people occupying the houses were the rightful owners. Those who could not produce documentation were kicked out. Spokesman Kay Makhubela said the police had the situation under control. &ldquo;We have been monitoring the protest since it started in the morning. You must understand that this march was approved.&rdquo; The protesters handed over a memorandum of demands to Gauteng Human Settlements&rsquo; Goodwill Mashele. The department was given 14 days to reply.
