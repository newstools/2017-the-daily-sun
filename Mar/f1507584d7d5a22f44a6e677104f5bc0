GUGULETHU residents protested on Sunday against the brutal killing of Phumza Pita. Phumza (32) was allegedly shot dead by a cop on Saturday night when police were closing down an illegal shebeen at Koornhof Street, New Crossroads, close to Cape Town. Phumza was a patron there that night. Elliot Pitshea (36) said he was at a braai stand close to the shebeen when shots were fired. &ldquo;Cops arrived and wanted the shebeen to close down because it was after hours. &ldquo;In the process they pepper sprayed Phumza. She demanded to know why the officer was spraying her since she was already walking out. &ldquo;The cop slapped her. When she confronted him, he shot her about six times in her face. She died on the spot.&rdquo; Thobeka Pita (50) said: &ldquo;We want answers. Why did they kill our child? Her oldest child is 11. Who is going to look after her children? These cops must pay for what they did.&rdquo; Captain Frederick van Wyk, Western Cape police spokesman, said the matter was being handled by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. IPID spokesman Moses Dlamini confirmed closing down the shebeen. &ldquo;People allegedly became unruly and police called for back-up. Community members allegedly attacked the police by throwing stones and damaging cop vehicles. &ldquo;An officer was allegedly surrounded by about 10 people who tried to rob him of his firearm.&rdquo; Dlamini said the officer fired three warning shots. He said Phumza had been injured in the process and was rushed to KTC Day Hospital, where she died. According to Dlamini, Phumza&rsquo;s uncle was also shot in his right arm. A case of murder and attempted murder has been opened.
