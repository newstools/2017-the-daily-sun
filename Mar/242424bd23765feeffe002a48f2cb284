FOREVER ready!That is the motto of Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; experienced goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands, who is expected to step into the firing line against Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm) when the Absa Premiership resumes this weekend.The PSL was in recess during the two-week Fifa break but there will be plenty of fireworks when the league and African champions face title contenders Amakhosi.Sandilands is set to deputise for injured Denis Onyango, who has been sidelined with damaged ligaments sustained during the recent 2-0 league win over Bidvest Wits at Loftus Versfeld.Said Sandilands, a former Bafana Bafana keeper: &ldquo;Denis has been recovering but I always prepare for a game as if I&rsquo;m playing. I make sure I&rsquo;m always ready and prepared to come on whenever the club needs me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this position before against Wits when Denis got injured and in the second leg of the Caf Champions League final against Zamalek.&rdquo;Sandilands said the Chiefs clash was not a league decider but stressed Downs were chasing the three points: &ldquo;There are plenty of games left after Chiefs. However, three points would be massive in our quest to retain the title. &ldquo;It would give us a psychological boost as Chiefs are also in the title mix with us. Chiefs have the momentum and are on a good run.&rdquo;Amakhosi are unbeaten in their last 10 matches in all competitions and are fourth in the table with 36 points &ndash; two ahead of Downs, who have four matches in hand.Stressed Sandilands: &ldquo;We all know games in hand are not points in the bag. We&rsquo;ve dropped a couple of points since we beat Wits, but we&rsquo;ll be highly motivated on Saturday.&rdquo;Sandilands lavished praise on striker Percy Tau, who scored on debut for Bafana in the 3-1 win over Guinea-Bissau at the weekend: &ldquo;Percy is a super talent. It is up to the senior players including myself to guide him and make sure he reaches his potential.&rdquo;
