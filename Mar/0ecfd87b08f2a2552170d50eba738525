THERE was drama on Thursday morning when 30 gang members looted Rainbow&rsquo;s Tavern! And although cops were armed with rubber bullets and protective gear, everything inside the tavern in Phola Park, near KwaLanga in Uitenhage, had been carried off. Residents said the violence was triggered by the death of a gang member who was stabbed the previous night after community members raided the homes of gangsters. By the time the cops arrived, the fridges in the tavern had been emptied of booze. They watched helplessly as members of the Hollywood gang whistled for backup. Some kindhearted residents took sofas, washing machines, TVs, cigarettes and the remaining booze and watched guard over them. Resident Bongani Booi (35) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;These boys started looting in broad daylight. &ldquo;We are victims of looting and break-ins every day, and these boys say they don&rsquo;t care about the consequences. We will call a community meeting to talk about these issues. &ldquo;They break into our houses every day. There are many gang members here.&rdquo; Another resident, Mzuvukile Mtana, said: &ldquo;Last year, they took my younger brother and stripped him naked, wrote their gang name on his body and threatened to kill him if he wrote matric.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the cops were looking for the suspects involved in the stabbing of a 21-year-old man. She said: &ldquo;The incident happened after 11pm in Tambo Village on Wednesday night. &ldquo;He died on arrival in hospital. The motive is not yet known. Anyone with information can contact Kamesh police on 041 988 8719, Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211.&rdquo; Yesterday, the gang memembers returned to torch the tavern.
