WHEN gogo Anna Manganye was given an RDP house four months ago, she was overjoyed. But today the 63-year-old from Extension 7 in Soshanguve, Tshwane is bitter and disappointed. This is because the ceiling of her new house caved in and almost fell on her four grandchildren, aged between four and 10! Gogo Anna told Daily Sun the kids had just gone into her bedroom to play on Saturday morning when the ceiling fell on to their beds in another room. At the time, the gogo was hanging up the laundry outside.&ldquo;I struggled to get inside but part of the ceiling had fallen near the door,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I breathed a sigh of relief after noticing that my grandchildren were safely playing in my bedroom. I thanked the Almighty God for protecting them.&rdquo; Gogo Anna said the ceiling became wet when it rained for most of last week. Councillor Enos Chiloane said the roof has a one-year guarantee. &ldquo;All those whose houses are affected are advised to report the problem to the site camp so that the contractors can be sent to fix it,&rdquo; he said.
