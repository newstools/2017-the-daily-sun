Arsenal forward Alex Iwobi has urged the club's supporters to respect manager Arsene Wenger, calling the Gunners faithful "impatient".Wenger, who has managed the London club for more than 20 years but is out of contract at the end of this season, has seen calls for him to step down intensify recently as the team's results have taken a downward turn as the they find themselves out of the top four in the league and out of the Champions League.The Frenchman has said that he has already made his decision, with reports suggesting that he will sign a new deal to stay on at the Emirates Stadium.Nigeria international Iwobi though says the players are just as frustrated as the fans.Speaking to the Daily Mail, Iwobi said: "They need to have a bit more respect, in my opinion."I mean, he's been at the club for 20 years, he's achieved a lot, obviously they're a bit impatient with the results and where they want to finish."We also want to finish there, we want to win the league like anyone else. I can guarantee we are trying our hardest."Whatever happens we are the players, we affect the result. We don't really look at the banners or what fans are screaming, we focus on trying to do our jobs on the pitch."
