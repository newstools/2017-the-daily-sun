Two appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrates Court yesterday.“Two people are already being questioned. It is regrettable that one of our own members is among the two,” he added.Phahlane said the arrest reaffirmed the police’s decision not to rule out the possibility that the heist was an inside job.More arrests are likely, he said. The police vehicle used during the heist was bogus.A total of R24m was stolen from a plane at the airport last Tuesday.Suspects in a marked police vehicle intercepted the money after an SAA flight landed. A white Mercedes-Benz is believed to have also been used in the operation.Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said a high-level investigation, involving all law enforcement agencies, was underway. Phahlane also announced that four men were arrested for the murders of 14 men in Benoni.He said all the accused were from Lesotho. One of the four was arrested in SA while the others were bust in Lesotho.“We are in discussion with our Interpol colleagues to facilitate the extradition of those in Lesotho,” Phahlane said – NEWS24
