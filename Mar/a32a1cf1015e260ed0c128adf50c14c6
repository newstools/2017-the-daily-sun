IT&rsquo;S a lucky time for this week&rsquo;s winner madala Samson Brukhwe (60) of Dikeni village in Eastern Cape. The excited madala said he never misses a chance to enter Daily Sun competitions. He said his winning streak has come back knocking at his door for the second time since he won in 2014. The madala said he has been entering the People&rsquo;s Paper&rsquo;s competitions for years now and his R2 500 Checkers voucher has come at the right time. He said he has been struggling to pay off his debt. &ldquo;I will use the money to pay the outstanding balance for my glasses. &ldquo;I will use the rest of it to buy some groceries.&rdquo; The madala, who works as a distributing agent in Mthatha, said he buys the paper every day, no matter where he is. He said the only time he doesn&rsquo;t buy it is when he doesn&rsquo;t have money. &ldquo;I will buy my favourite newspaper and enter more competitions because I have luck up my sleeves.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks a lot to the People&rsquo;s Paper. I am now the happiest man. All my financial problems will be resolved now.&rdquo; He said he has already entered last week&rsquo;s voucher competition. &ldquo;I believe I will win again because I&rsquo;ve won money voucher competitions in the past especially when I lived in Cape Town.&rdquo;
