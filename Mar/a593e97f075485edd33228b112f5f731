A PASTOR has been suspended from a community radio station, allegedly because he used vulgar language on his programme.Pastor Simo Nene of the True Gospel Church did not speak on Imbokodo FM yesterday. The pastor&rsquo;s show, Delabuthongo, airs on the Pinetown based station from Monday to Wednesday.During his sermon, Nene allegedly used the word shit on air. Station manager Sandile Ngema said they were forced to suspend Nene because the words he used went against their broadcasting licence rules.&ldquo;We were in danger of having our broadcasting licence confiscated.&rdquo;Nene denied using offensive language.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember using vulgar language during my preaching,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised the station has said I was suspended for that.Ngema said Nene knew very well why he had been suspended.&ldquo;I called him to my office where I told him to stay away until the hearing.&rdquo;
