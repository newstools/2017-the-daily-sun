TWICE Yonela Thuswa (26) lied to his ancestors.&nbsp; First he failed to attend his gogo&rsquo;s funeral, and then he didn&rsquo;t show up for a family ritual. But both times Yonela had taken time off work, and even borrowed money from his boss to apparently go and have a good time. But now, said his angry family, the ancestors have come for him! This was after Yonela went missing without a trace. Yonela&rsquo;s sister Busiswa Thuswa (34) from Alexandra, north of Joburg said they believed the ancestors were angry with their brother for lying to them. &ldquo;When our gogo died, Yonela borrowed money from his boss and took days off work &ndash;&ensp;but he wasn&rsquo;t at the funeral.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two weeks ago, when he was supposed to join us back home for the ritual, again he borrowed cash and took days off. But he didn&rsquo;t show up.&rdquo; Busiswa said the search for her bother has so far yielded no results and the family had lost hope of finding him alive.&nbsp; She said she believed the dead could punish the living in different ways. &ldquo;My brother angered the dead by choosing beer over respecting his ancestors. His friend who was last seen with him told us when he left him he seemed confused and claimed he was talking to the ancestors,&rdquo; she said. Busiswa said she reported Yonela missing at Tembisa cop shop but officers there told her to first check mortuaries and hospitals. &ldquo;He is not in any hospital or mortuary in Gauteng.&rdquo;&nbsp; An elder of the family, Zimasile Thuswa, told Daily Sun it was wrong for a person to lie and use the names of the dead as an excuse.&nbsp;He said Yonela&rsquo;s mum died in a bus accident when he was just three years old, and that his father vanished without a trace in 2000.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re afraid that we won&rsquo;t see him again, just like his father,&rdquo; said Zimasile.
