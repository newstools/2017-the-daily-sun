WHEN the democratic government took power over 20 years ago, it promised a better life for all. But for Jalisile Mbhele from KwaDweshula Village near Port Shepstone, on the KZN&rsquo;s south coast, nothing about her life is better. The 58-year-old mum shares a dilapidated two-roomed mud house with her 20-year-old son. Every time it rains, life becomes a living hell for them. Jalisile claims to have applied for an RDP house on four occasions since councillors were introduced. But to date, she still hasn&rsquo;t received a house, nor any feedback or developments. &ldquo;I have applied three times with the previous councillors and once with the current one. &ldquo;Where I live, I have no electricity, no running water and no toilet,&rdquo; she said. Jalisile told Daily Sun that the pit toilet she once had was blown away by the wind. &ldquo;Its floor was sinking. When nature calls, I have to run to the nearby bushes to relieve myself.&rdquo;Jalisile and her son are both unemployed and rely on piece jobs like working in people&rsquo;s gardens or washing cars to put food on their table. She said she hopes to get a proper house and toilet before she dies. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I must do to get attention from the officials. &ldquo;Every day is a struggle for us. &ldquo;I have applied, but have been so unlucky.&ldquo;Even going to the toilet is a struggle since I can&rsquo;t relieve myself during the day.&rdquo; Councillor Lindiwe Shezi said she wasn&rsquo;t aware of the family&rsquo;s difficult situation until local induna Bongani Msomi alerted her to it.&ldquo;To be honest, I wasn&rsquo;t aware that they live in such a miserable house.&ldquo;I recently visited them and took the report to the municipality. &ldquo;They have promised to intervene,&rdquo; she said.
