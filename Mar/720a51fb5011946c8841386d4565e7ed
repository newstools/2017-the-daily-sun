UNIVERSITY of Pretoria&rsquo;s chances of making a quick return to the Absa Premiership are slowly fading.At the beginning of the 2016-17 season AmaTuks coach Shaun Bartlett had envisioned being among the pacesetters in the National First Division by the time they had nine games left.But as things stand AmaTuks, who were relegated last season, are not anywhere near the top four.Ama&shy;Tuks have won eight, lost eight and registered five draws in the 21 games played in the NFD so far, which sees them lying ninth in the table with 29 points. They are 16 points behind table-toppers Thanda Royal Zulu, who have accumulated 44 points. While still with Golden Arrows in the 2014-15 season, Bartlett helped the club regain promotion after just one season in NFD and it is fair to say the former Bafana Bafana striker was expected to repeat the feat with AmaTuks this season.Bartlett admits they have not met expectations but believes they still stand a chance of getting a top three finish and making their way to the PSL via the play-offs.He said: &ldquo;It has been a disappointing season for us so far. &ldquo;There are lots of things that we could have done better. Our biggest challenge is consistency &ndash; we&rsquo;re good today and tomorrow we&rsquo;re not. &ldquo;In the nine remaining games we need to collect as many points as we can to finish in the top three.&rdquo;When the NFD resumes tomorrow, AmaTuks will be up against Witbank Spurs at Mpumalanga&rsquo;s Puma Stadium (3pm). Spurs defeated AmaTuks 2-0 at Tuks Stadium in the first round.Meanwhile, Magesi FC look set to go down to the ABC Motsepe League.In another match tomorrow, promotion hopefuls Stellenbosch FC host AmaZulu at Athlone Stadium (3pm), while leaders Thanda will be hoping to keep their momentum when they host relegation-haunted Santos at Umhlathuze Sports Complex on Sunday.
