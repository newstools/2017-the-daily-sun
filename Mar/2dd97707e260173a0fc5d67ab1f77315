IT WAS meant to be a quick and easy job!All they had to do was shoot at the van, push it off the road, grab the cash and get away. But it was not to be.It seems the would-be robbers had not banked on the cash vehicle having an escort &ndash; another van with more guards inside. The robbers allegedly shot at the vehicles, pushing both off the road. The incident took place at about 4am yesterday along the Westernburg and Matlala roads outside Polokwane in Limpopo.The four suspects allegedly tried to get the money out of the safe but failed. They called off the mission, leaving behind their BMW, and jumped into their getaway car.But luck was not on their side.In less than an hour, the long arm of the law had caught up with them at a garage in Polokwane.Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident and said four suspects aged between 26 and 53 were arrested. &ldquo;The armed suspects attacked two security vehicles, one transporting cash and the other an escort vehicle. Both cars had five security officers. &ldquo;The suspects shot at the security vehicle, which overturned. All five security officers sustained serious injuries,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.He praised the detective team for a job well done. Cops recovered two rifles with four magazines and two pistols, as well as three VW Polos and the dumped BMW.&ldquo;The source of the cars and firearms is still being investigated. The suspects will appear in the Polokwane Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo; General Nneke Ledwaba commended the quick reaction by police which led to the breakthrough.
