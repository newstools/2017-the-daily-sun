MARITZBURG United coach Roger de Sa believes that a top eight finish has become a reality for his team. For the first time since De Sa took over the reins early last month, United are back in the top eight mix. The Team of Choice&rsquo;s 2-1 win over relegation-threatened Free State Stars on Sunday took them to eighth in the table. It was De Sa&rsquo;s first win and only the second for United at home this season. De Sa was on cloud nine after his team recovered well after a first-half goal by Mohammed Anas and managed to grab all the points. &ldquo;I think we deserve this win. &ldquo;The players showed us their true character and what they are capable of after going a goal down. Our substitutes, especially Evans Rusike and Devon Saal, made a huge difference and their runs confused Free State Stars&rsquo; defence.&ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re back in the top eight, things just got real for us. This win just enables us to look ahead. Now we are ready to compete and make sure we stay in the top eight. The glass is half full for us, not half empty.&rdquo;Even though things are not looking good for Ea Lla Koto, coach Serame Letsoaka remains adamant that they won&rsquo;t go down. He said: &ldquo;We still have time to avoid the chop. The traffic is heavy down there and we need to distance ourselves from it. We play Highlands Park next and need to make sure we get a positive result to open up a gap between us and them.&rdquo; The defeat left Stars in 14th place, just four points ahead of 15th-placed Highlands and five ahead of Baroka FC, who are at the bottom of the table.
