CLEOPAS Maunye was sacked following claims that he conspired with the ANC during the August municipal elections and that he got a R30-million kickback for his troubles.The Bushbuckridge Residents&rsquo; Association secretary &ndash; who represented the small party in the Mpumalanga legislature &ndash; will leave office on Thursday 30 March. Maunye said he was expelled last week. &ldquo;The party president, Delta Mokoena, convened meetings in the wards and accused me of holding meetings with the ANC behind his back,&rdquo; said Maunye, adding that he has had enough of baseless accusations and would be leaving the party and the legislature at the end of the month. Mokoena confirmed the expulsion. But a spokesman for the party, Thabang Moripe, said many members are unhappy over Maunye&rsquo;s expulsion. He said no one came forward with evidence to show he had indeed been given R30 million to sabotage the party or had held secret meetings with the ANC.
