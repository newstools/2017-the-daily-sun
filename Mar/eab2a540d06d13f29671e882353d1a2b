SUPERSPORT UNITED&rsquo;s strong mentality and the hunger to win games could come in handy for the Tshwane giants during their hectic schedule.That&rsquo;s according to their skipper Clayton Daniels. Matsatsantsa a Pitori are competing on three fronts: the Caf Confederation Cup, the Premiership and the Nedbank Cup. Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s charges are expected to do well in all the competitions, looking at the quality of the squad at their disposal. Matsatsantsa are among favourites to win the league title and end their seven-year wait for the championship title. The Tshwane giants are third on the log table with 37 points from 20 matches, two points behind leaders Cape Town City FC, who have played one game more. Last season, Daniels lifted the Ke Yona Cup and he&rsquo;s optimistic that his side can do it again. They negotiated a tricky encounter in the Last 32 round when they narrowly defeated National First Division championship hopefuls, Royal Eagles, 2-1 in Pietermaritzburg. The holders take on third-tier minnows, Kwa-Dukuza United, in the Last 16 stages. It&rsquo;s a battle between David and Goliath. Things are also looking good in the Confederation Cup too as the Tshwane giants are through to the Last 32 round. The three times Premiership champions will play against BYC of Liberia over two legs next month. Daniels said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mentally strong and we don&rsquo;t take teams for granted. We&rsquo;ll tread carefully in the cup game. We have a busy programme with matches coming in thick and fast, but we have a quality squad that can bring us success.&rdquo;
