Johannes’ wife, Ester, said it was cruel that someone would just rob them of a bakkie that cost a lot of money.“But we’ll soon have it back,” said Ester.Lehlonolo Tlali (52) said his Nissan Bantam was hijacked at gunpoint in Carletonville on 25 January. “On 22 February I went to the sangoma, who helped me to find my bakkie in Fochville. “I lost hope that I would ever see it again until I consulted Mandla.“I was so happy. I had a tracking system in my bakkie but it didn’t help. Thanks to Mandla for tracking it,” said Lehlonolo.Mandla said: “Sometimes it takes me 30 days to find a car, but usually it takes about a week.“People must stop stealing other people’s hard-earned property. One day I will send a flying snake to strike them.”
