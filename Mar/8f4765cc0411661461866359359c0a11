FOR six months, mastands Simon (63) and Dorcas Tshishonge (43) rented out the room, never suspecting a thing.But when the tenant skipped payment for the second month in a row on Thursday, they decided to have a look inside his room. To their horror, they found out their tenant was a prophet. His surgery was filled with muthi, animal skulls and candles.The mastands suspect he is a fake prophet.Dorcas, from Xubini section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t knew this man was operating a surgery in my yard. &ldquo;No wonder people kept coming to my house. They came to witness this madness.&ldquo;I have now given him a notice to leave because he hasn&rsquo;t been paying rent.&ldquo;But what I found here is very disturbing. I called him several times and just kept saying he was coming.&rdquo;Simon said he no longer trusts the tenant. &ldquo;He came here saying he was looking for a room to rent. The next thing I knew, he was operating a surgery in my yard.&rdquo;Dorcas said: &ldquo;The prophet must take his things and leave my yard.&rdquo;
