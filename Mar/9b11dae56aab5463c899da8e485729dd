HIPPOS are widely considered to be some of the most dangerous animals in Africa . . . But they don&rsquo;t scare Tonie Joubert one bit!In 2000, a flood swept a hippo onto his farm in Hoedspruit, Limpopo. Tonie adopted the hippo and named it Jessica. Even though hippos often attack humans, Jessica has a soft spot for people. She attracts tourists from all over the world and has had a number of documentaries shot about her. Tonie said: &ldquo;When my wife Shirley saw Jessica, she fell in love with her and agreed to marry me. &ldquo;Jessica is not in captivity. She comes and goes as she pleases. Every night she goes out to graze with other hippos and comes back later. I trust her because she has never hurt anyone.&rdquo;Jessica eats 80kg of food per day and loves to eat grass, sweet potatoes and carrots. She weighs 1 800kg and her skin is two and a half centimetres thick. Shirley spends two hours giving Jessica a full body massage once a week.Tonie said Jessica sleeps on his veranda. He covers the hippo with blankets when it is cold outside.&ldquo;She has already broken five beds,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We let her come indoors because she enjoys watching television. &ldquo;Every year we throw a big party for her and this is the only place in the whole world where you can interact with a hippo like this.&ldquo;Jessica is now ready to mate and could have a baby hippo by the end of the year. I&rsquo;m not going to adopt the baby. I&rsquo;ll let Jessica raise it.&rdquo;He said Jessica is very protective and once killed a crocodile that was trying to attack him.Tonie has another hippo called Richie. He discovered Richie in 2012 after he was also washed off by floods.
