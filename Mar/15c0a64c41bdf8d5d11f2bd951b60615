THEY were living on top of a ticking time bomb. Their shacks were built on a huge sinkhole that could collapse at any time.So the City of Tshwane told the 29 families at Jeffsville in Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane to destroy their shacks and said they would be moved to a safer area.Then their local councillor, Solomon Sedibeng, visited the area and said the families in only six shacks would be moved.But the families were left to sleep out in the cold last Tuesday night.Velas Matsebele (36) said when she saw that it was getting late she asked her neighbour to allow her two kids to sleep in her shack.&ldquo;I had to keep watch the whole night because I feared my belongings would be stolen,&rdquo; she said.She said what made her angry was that it started to rain during the night.&ldquo;My furniture was ruined as a result.&rdquo;Another resident, Refiloe Manyane (50), said they didn&rsquo;t feel safe because of the sinkhole.But she said only families that lived near the sinkhole were told they would be moved.&ldquo;What about us, are they waiting for tragedy to strike?&rdquo;Sedibeng said trucks were sent to the area but the residents stopped them entering the area.&ldquo;All the families who were told to dis- assemble their shacks are now being taken to a safe place in Lotus.&rdquo; Lindela Mashigo, the City of Tshwane spokesman, said all the families who were told to demolish their shacks had been moved to a safer place in Lotus Gardens.
