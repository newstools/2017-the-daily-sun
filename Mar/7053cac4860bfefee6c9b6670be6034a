BAROKA FC goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke says they are working hard to maintain their Absa Premiership status. Bakgaga are bottom of the log table and seem likely to return to the National First Division after just one season in top flight football. Baroka were able to escape with a point in their last league match against title-chasing Kaizer Chiefs, which ended 2-2. Masuluke, still famous for his overhead goal against Orlando Pirates which won him Goal of the Month for November 2016, is hoping they will be able to continue where they left off before the Fifa break.They have a league date with SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium tomorrow (3pm) in a top versus bottom duel.Matsatsantsa a Pitori will also be looking to return to winning ways following two recent draws.Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s charges, which have been hampered by a number of injuries this season, will be hoping to dethrone current log leaders Cape Town City at the top of the table.Masuluke said the Goal of the Month award was motivation for him to work hard to help keep the team afloat and in the Premiership.Said Masuluke: &ldquo;I am happy to have won the award. It provides extra motivation not to give up but to work harder. &ldquo;We know we are not in a good position but this is not the time to bury our heads in shame. We can still do better.&rdquo;Masuluke is concerned because they are not able to find the back of the net, which always puts them on the back foot.He said they had monitored SuperSport&rsquo;s last few matches and would aim to stop them in their tracks. He said: &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy but our preparations are going well. &ldquo;They play with a lot of crosses and we should also guard them in set-pieces, on which they thrive.&rdquo;
