THREE years later, gogo Margaret Buthelezi (79) is still waiting for her RDP. The gogo from W Section in Umlazi, KZN, told Daily Sun she was miserable in her two-roomed shack. She said all her neighbours got houses in 2014 and she wanted eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to intervene. &ldquo;Councillor Amos Dladla told me there was a water pipe under my shack and promised my RDP would be built somewhere else,&rdquo; said gogo Margaret. She said whenever she called Dladla, he would tell her he was still dealing with the issue. &ldquo;Maybe he has forgotten about me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This shack is dangerous as snakes sometimes find their way in. This year I have found three snakes.&rdquo; Mayor Gumede&rsquo;s spokesman Mthunzi Gumede promised to investigate. &ldquo;We need to check all the facts before we say whether the mayor will be able to help,&rdquo; he said. Dladla said he knows about Margaret&rsquo;s matter. &ldquo;Engineers found that there is a water pipe under her house,&rdquo; said Dladla. &ldquo;Her matter, and those of many other residents in different sections of Umlazi, is being dealt with. &ldquo;Gogo must come to my office with her documents, including her ID, and I will check why this issue has not been resolved. I&rsquo;ll try to speed up things because there&rsquo;s a long list of residents who need help.&rdquo;
