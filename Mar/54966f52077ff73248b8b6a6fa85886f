EVERY year initiates flock to bush schools hoping to return to their waiting families as men. But year after year families never get to hear the voices or see the faces of their loved ones ever again. The massive extent of initiation deaths hit home yesterday when it was revealed that over the past 10 years, Eastern Cape initiation schools had caused no less than 500 deaths. The shocking figure was revealed during a sitting of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural&sbquo; Religious and Linguistic Communities. The commission rounded off its three-day meetings yesterday in the areas most affected by the deaths. Various government departments joined the session, held in Libode near Mthatha. The commission&rsquo;s chairwoman, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, said laws had to be enforced to ensure the safety of initiates. &ldquo;These are unnecessary deaths. The initiates die from dehydration, sepsis and assault.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Mthozami Silarha said cops faced a big challenge in that the victims refused to disclose illegal initiation school teachers&rsquo; names or whereabouts. Vusumuzi Mkhize, Home Affairs national deputy director-general, said a number of initiates had not been reported dead by their parents. A total of 67 boys had their 4-5s amputated in the past three years alone.
