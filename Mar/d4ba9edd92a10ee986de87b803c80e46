MFATSHE Khumbi says he thanks God for the time he spent in prison. The 38-year-old from Kagiso in Mogale City said he was forced into a life of crime at a young age, but these days he&rsquo;s a top chef thanks to the skills he learned in jail. He spent his 16 years behind bars studying. He obtained his matric certificate and later studied hospitality, which has enabled him to run his own restaurant.&ldquo;I lost my parents at an early age and I was forced to become the head of my family. I had to drop out of school to put food on the table for my siblings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This exposed me to a lot of bad things. &ldquo;I had to find a way to make money and started getting involved in armed robberies. &ldquo;Before I knew it, I had been sucked into a world of darkness and had turned into an animal.&rdquo; Mfatshe started a gang with friends, which specialised in robbery, drug dealing, hijacking and housebreaking. &ldquo;In 2000, I was caught during a high-speed chase with the cops. We had broken into a house and shot the owner,&rdquo; said Mfatshe. &ldquo;When we were bust, the police linked us to previous crimes we had committed. &ldquo;I was sentenced to life imprisonment and things changed forever.&rdquo; Mfatshe said during his time in prison he found God. &ldquo;I think prison was the best thing that could have happened to me. It gave me a lot of time to think about my life.&rdquo;After he left prison, a restaurant owner helped him set up his own business and today he&rsquo;s the proud owner of Lucky Royal Chef.
