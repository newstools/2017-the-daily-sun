KWADUKUZA United head coach Thami Ngubane plans to cause a major upset when his ABC Motsepe League team welcome Ajax Cape Town in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 round at Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium in Durban on Saturday (3pm). This tournament has become known for upsets, with minnows often finding that something extra to beat top clubs.It has happened twice to mighty Kaizer Chiefs, in 2009 and 2011, when they were booted out by University of Pretoria and Baroka FC respectively. Both were plying their trade in the National First Division at that stage. Last season it happened to Chippa United when they were beaten in the Last 32 by Natal United, who were playing in the ABC Motsepe League. Having coached a team that has played in this tournament before, Ngubane believes his experience and the hunger of his players will prevail against the Urban Warriors. &ldquo;My players are hungry for success and ready for the Ajax challenge. We know everything there is to know about them &ndash; but we are a closed book to them,&rdquo; said Ngubane. He was on the bench in the 2015 edition of this tournament when NFD side Thanda Royal Zulu held their own against Orlando Pirates. Thanda lost that match on penalties after holding Pirates 3-3 after extra time. Ngubane said he would pass his experience on to his players. &ldquo;The good thing is that I have six or seven players who have played in this tournament before for other teams. With their experience and mine, things are looking good for us. We will give it our all to make sure we progress to the next round,&rdquo; he said. The former Thanda mentor joined KwaDukuza in January and said he was confident he would be able to help them get to the national play-offs at the end of the season. They are currently eighth after 19 matches in a league of 17 teams. KwaDukuza United are newcomers. They are only six months old and were founded after the status of Natal United was purchased late last year.
