GRAVEYARDS are supposed to be respected.But thugs see cemeteries as a place to rob mourners. Last weekend, a family was robbed by three thugs at Mabopane Cemetery in Tshwane.The family was preparing the grave to erect a tombstone when it happened. John Maduwe (49) said they were preparing the grave of his wife&rsquo;s late gogo when the thugs attacked them.&ldquo;I was with my wife, daughter and a man we hired to erect the tombstone. &ldquo;The thugs ordered us to lie down and searched us. They took our cellphones, my money and my wife&rsquo;s wedding ring.&rdquo; He said the men went to their car and searched for more money before walking away.John said after the incident, they decided to continue what they were doing.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t let them bring us down. We carried on preparing the grave because it was important to us.&rdquo;John said he never thought they would be robbed at a graveyard.&ldquo;It is a respectable place where our ancestors are buried.&rdquo; He said the thugs don&rsquo;t respect the dead and will be punished for that.Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of armed robbery was opened.&ldquo;No one has been arrested and investigations are continuing.&rdquo;
