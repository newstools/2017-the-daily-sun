HAVING had lost in two recent matches to Zambia, Amajita should have taken the first semifinal of the Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations as a chance to settle the score. However Edward Chilufya&rsquo;s extra time goal was enough to send the hosts to the final on Sunday. Now Amajita have to work hard to walk away with a medal, in their third place match playoffs on Sunday having already qualified for the FIFA Under-20 World Cup. South Africa put up a good fight but it seems the teargas at the National Heroes Stadium might have played a part and they lost focus when it mattered.Amajita coach, Thabo Senong must have been disappointed with the missed chances in the second half from Thendo Mukumela, Sibongakonke Mbatha and Luther Singh who could have wrapped the game then.South Africa matched Junior Chipolopolo in a lot of components in the match. Qualifying for the global competition must have given the players more confidence to match up their counterparts. They were able to anticipate and halt some of their advances into the goal scoring areas. However Amajita lacked a solid game plan on how they would move forward into the Zambian defence in search of goal scoring opportunities. Shooting forward without a target or how the end product should be didn&rsquo;t help in anyway forcing them to take long range shots which were off target. They were not going into the box in numbers to give options in the area.Amajita&rsquo;s defence had however improved from their match against Sudan on Sunday, the hosts struggled to penetrate the defence and often going for long range shots outside of the box. Goalkeeper, Mondli Mpoto also put on a good performance, making a few saves in the game which stretched the game into extra time.
