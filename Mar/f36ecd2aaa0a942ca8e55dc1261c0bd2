WHEN family members brought the body of their murdered relative to Joburg for a burial, they did not know that death was following them all the way to Jozi.During Friday night&rsquo;s vigil held in Thembelihle near Lenasia, south of Joburg, about 10 gunmen stormed into the tent, shooting wildly. Others waited outside for people who tried to escape. Two people were shot dead and eight others were injured.Soweto West CPF cluster chairman Mishack Tebe saidthe dead man was killed in Welkom, Free State, but he could not be buried in Lesotho.&ldquo;On Friday we heard gunshots and received a call saying Basothos were killing people. When we arrived at the scene we found two people dead and others injured,&rdquo; said Tebe, adding that rival gangs follow each other wherever any other gang buries family members.On Saturday many rival Lesotho gangs attended the funeral dressed in blankets and carrying sticks. They danced as they drove to the Lenasia Cemetery.The provincial police spokesman said: &ldquo;We are appealing to community members to come forward with information to help find the wanted men.&rdquo;
