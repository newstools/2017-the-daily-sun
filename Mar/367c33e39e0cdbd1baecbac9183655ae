Arsenal midfielder, Granit Xhaka, has claimed that transferring to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich would be a lateral move for him.The Gunners' midfield enforcer has come under increasing pressure recently for both his poor disciplinary record as well as failing to deliver on his &pound;35 million price tag.Now, despite admitting on Friday that the criticism had 'hurt' him, the player insists that a move back to the Bundesliga is not something that he would be interested in, even if it is to title-holders Bayern Munich.&nbsp;&ldquo;I have read that too. But I have not heard anything," the Switzerland international told&nbsp;Blick&nbsp;when asked about reports suggesting interest from the Alianz Arena.&ldquo;I am in an outstanding city, an outstanding club," he continued. "The only thing that Arsenal has been missing is a league title. I believe that will change soon.&rdquo;The former Borussia Monchengladbach player was also asked whether he would ever consider a move back to Germany.&ldquo;Yeah, but it&rsquo;s not like I want to go back tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.Speaking about his side's humiliating Champions League elimination at the hands of his reported suitors, Xhaka was quick to point out that he sees little difference between the two clubs.&ldquo;From my view they are [on the same level]. That&rsquo;s how I feel," the 24-year old said. "The defeats annoy me particularly because I have had good memories against Bayern.&ldquo;We were able to beat them three times with Gladbach. And I don&rsquo;t think Gladbach are on the same level as Arsenal,&rdquo; he added.
