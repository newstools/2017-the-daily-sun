REIGNING IBO welterweight world champion, Tsiko &ldquo;Cruel Junior&rdquo; Mulovhedzi, is on the verge of being stripped of his title without even throwing a punch.&nbsp;This as Mulovhedzi has been at home, twiddling his thumb, without defending his title since his previous fight last year. But IBO rules stipulate that a champion should defend his title once every ninth month, unless medically excused.And the champ&rsquo;s ninth month ended in January.Mulovhedzi had shocked the boxing fraternity when he demolished defending champion, Ali &ldquo;Rush Hour&rdquo; Funeka, in the fifth round at East London&rsquo;s ICC Hall in July 2015 to capture the IBO crown. Thereafter, he successfully defended his crown against Mexican Jesus Gurrola at Ngoako Ramatlhodi Sports Complex in Seshego in April.Said Cruel Junior: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unhappy, but there&rsquo;s nothing I can do. This situation is beyond my control. &ldquo;I spoke with Ayanda Matiti (his promoter) and he told me he was no longer working with the IBO.&rdquo; But Tsiko&rsquo;s brother Ratshibvumo blames Matiti for making empty promises.Said Ratshibvumo: &ldquo;My brother is loyal to Matiti, but he doesn&rsquo;t have his best interest at heart. There are many top boxers who wanted to challenge Tsiko, including Lovemore Ndou. But he tells them my brother is injured, which is not true.&rdquo;Although Tsiko is scheduled to contest with German-based Dario &ldquo;Italian Trouble&rdquo; Socci for the vacant IBF intercontinental crown in Bloemfontein on 17 March, a very sceptical Ratshibvumo is not convinced.&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; he said.The hard-hitting fighter has 11 wins, seven defeats and three draws, while Socci only has two losses in 13 outings with a single draw.
