THOMAS Nicholas can&rsquo;t find peace.Wherever he goes, the voice of a woman whispers, &ldquo;Lala phansi,&rdquo; which means lie down. And when he doesn&rsquo;t lie down, the whisper turns to a shout. Thomas, from Rosettenville, Joburg said: &ldquo;When I go to the mall, people think I&rsquo;m crazy when I just lie down in the middle of the building.&rdquo;He said he started hearing the voice about two months ago when he met a girl at a tavern and took her back home.&ldquo;We had a great night in bed, but after she left I started hearing the voice.&rdquo;He said he tried to trace the woman from the tavern, but nobody knows where she is.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take her phone number. That one night stand has ruined my life.&ldquo;Sometime when I sleep, I find myself on the floor. &ldquo;That is the only time I can sleep peacefully.&rdquo;Thomas said he cannot imagine living like this for the rest of his life and said he needs help.&ldquo;This is the worst time of my life. No one could ignore those voices. I have tried and failed.&rdquo; Sangoma Precious Sithole from Thokoza in Ekurhuleni said the voice is a spiritual woman who will prevent Thomas from getting another girlfriend. &ldquo;Thomas must go to a sangoma to get rid of the invisible woman or he will never find peace.&rdquo;
