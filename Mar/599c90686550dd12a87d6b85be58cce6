THE new Bafana Bafana head coach, who Safa president Danny Jordan has promised to name this week, will have plenty to think about after watching the national side draw 0-0 against lively Angola in a friendly international played at a sold out Buffalo City Stadium, East London, last night.The new man who will replace fired Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba will have noticed he has a big job on his hands. Bafana lacked the killer instinct and failed to put away a side ranked 147th in the Fifa world rankings. Bafana are ranked 62 by the world body.But the result stretched Bafana&rsquo;s unbeaten run to a record 17 matches.Bafana caretaker coach Owen da Gama made nine changes from the starting line-up that beat Guinea Bissau 3-1 in Durban at the weekend. Both matches were used in preparation for September&rsquo;s back to back 2018 World Cup qualifiers against Cape Verde.Da Gama handed defender Diamond Thopela, and two exciting SA Under-20 stars Phakamani Mahlambi and Luther Singh their debuts.He also brought back goalkeeper Darren Keet who got a raw deal from Mashaba who dropped the Bidvest Wits keeper after the 3-1 loss to Algeria in January 2015 during the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Equatorial Guinea. Bafana have now played Angola 16 times and lost only once to the Palancas Negras. As a result of the many changes, Bafana struggled to settle in a fast flowing first half and that cost the home side. It was a tough baptism for both teenagers Mahlambi and Singh at senior level. The Bafana midfield struggled to get control and failed to support striker Percy Tau who battled to get any decent balls at his feet and was unable to use his pace to run at the defenders.It took a stunning save from Keet to deny Herenilson a goal in the 38th minute.There were a lot of promising early moves form the home side but the well disciplined Angolan defence broke up attack after attack and eventually it was the visitors who took the initiative midway through the opening spell.Bafana showed a more adventurous style at the start of the second half when Da Gama introduced Keagan Dolly and Thulani Serero into the attack but the well marshalled Angolan defence managed to weather the storm.
