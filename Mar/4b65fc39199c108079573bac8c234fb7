HUSKY-VOICED DJ Zeal has joined Vuma FM as a Breakfast Show host!&nbsp;This follows her stint at East Coast Radio last year, after moving back home a few years ago to join Gagasi FM.&nbsp;The Umlazi-based DJ, real name Zandile Dladla, is excited about her new career development.&nbsp;&ldquo;I had known for a while and it was hard to keep the secret to myself. But finally, on 1 March, I was able to share the news with my fans, family and friends,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;The DJ said she had paid her dues, and hosting the Breakfast Show was a stamp of approval for herself and her radio career.&nbsp;&ldquo;I started my radio journey at Voice of Wits, while still studying at Wits.&nbsp;&ldquo;Then, I moved on to Metro FM, where I nurtured both my on-air and vinyl deejaying skills. It&rsquo;s been a long journey, but I&rsquo;m here now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;The anthropology graduate said she had great plans for the year ahead and hoped her fans would support her, as she grew her brand and her reach on Vuma FM.&nbsp;She co-hosts the show with Makhosi Khoza and Gabriel Sithole.&nbsp;DJ Zandile brings to the station more than a decade of her radio experience and bubbly personality.&nbsp;
