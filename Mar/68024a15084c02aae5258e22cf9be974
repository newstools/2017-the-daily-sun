But then her eyes were opened by her sex-machine madala &ndash; who is blind!Elizabeth Tsotetsi (44) from Finetown, south of Joburg, said her sex life was sad until she met madala Alfred Tsotetsi (69) in 2009. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a wonderful eight years,&rdquo; a smiling Elizabeth told Daily Sun, praising her husband.&ldquo;He also has a very good sense of humour. With him, I&rsquo;m never bored.&rdquo; Blushing about their sex life, Elizabeth said her blind husband was a giant in bed. &ldquo;No one compares to him.&rdquo; She said they met in 2009 when she was a domestic worker and Alfred used to hang out at her friend&rsquo;s place.&ldquo;We would talk for hours, laughing.&rdquo; Soon she was helping the blind madala. &ldquo;I would walk with him to the shops or even the toilet. We got very close.&rdquo; Then Alfred asked her to be his permanent caretaker. &ldquo;We fell in love,&rdquo; she said.Alfred said that although he is blind, he takes good care of himself.&ldquo;I eat healthily and take walks, but apart from that being active has been in me ever since I was young,&rdquo; he joked.Alfred and Elizabeth have a good life together. The only thing troubling them is that they don&rsquo;t have a place of their own. &ldquo;We hope someone could help us with a house.&rdquo;They don&rsquo;t have kids yet, but they are working on having at least two.
