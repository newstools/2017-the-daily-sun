THE Constitutional Court today directed Sassa to answer a series of questions relating to the payment of grants.The questions must be answered by Monday. Accompanying affidavits will also have to be supplied.The court asked, among other things, whether Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini had any objections to the independent monitoring of any agreement Sassa had entered into with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for the payment of grants from 1 April.If so, the nature of the objections would have to be set out.The court also asked who the person was that was responsible for determining, on behalf of Sassa, whether the agency would not be able to pay grants by the end of March. It asked to be told exactly when it was realised that it would not be able to do so.It also demanded to know why it had not been immediately informed.This is a developing story.
