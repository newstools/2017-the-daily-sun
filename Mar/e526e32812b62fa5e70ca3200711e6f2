JACOB ZUMA fired Nhlanhla&nbsp;Nene and brought the economy of a nation to its knees.&nbsp;Once again, a shocked nation holds its breath.&nbsp;THIS TIME, IF HE FIRES PRAVIN GORDHAN, MZANSI MIGHT NOT RECOVER.&nbsp;Political parties, analysts and politicians have reacted with shock after Minister of&nbsp;Finance Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, were told to cancel their international investor roadshow.&ldquo;The president is a wrecking ball!&rdquo; former general secretary of Cosatu, Zwelinzima Vavi, told Daily Sun.&nbsp;&ldquo;He knows this will have a huge impact but he doesn&rsquo;t care about the economy and the 9 million unemployed people. He is relentlessly pursuing the agenda to capture Treasury.&nbsp;&ldquo;We expect a reshuffle and the bringing into cabinet of Zuma&rsquo;s cronies. The intention is to use Treasury to allow hyenas to feed at the trough!&rdquo;DA shadow minister of finance David Maynier said: &ldquo;It appears, at best, calculated to humiliate the minister or, at worst, to suggest he is about to be fired in a cabinet reshuffle.&rdquo;Cope national chairman Pakes Dikgetsi said: &ldquo;It adds to the slap in the face of the delegation.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Zuma has clearly stooped very low once again. It will add to Cope&rsquo;s long held view that Zuma only acts in his own interests.&rdquo;Political commentator Professor Barry Hanyane said it was a shocking move.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky. It&rsquo;s a radical move.&rdquo;&nbsp;The Save South Africa campaign said Zuma was acting with unbridled recklessness.&ldquo;It is a sign of extremely weak leadership. The ultimate victims will be the poor and Zuma must be held accountable.&rdquo;&nbsp;ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the party did not discuss the matter at their NEC meeting.&nbsp;Gordhan himself tried to calm the nervous investment community. &ldquo;I have not been recalled. I have been asked to come home,&rdquo; he said.
