NEIGHBOURS say they heard a loud bang and went outside to investigate. They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes when they saw a taxi had crashed into their neighbour&rsquo;s rented house. On closer inspection, they realised that the 51-year-old driver &ndash; who was alone in the vehicle &ndash; was dead! A neighbour told Daily Sun that the tenant, who rents one of the rooms, was not at home. &ldquo;The taxi came speeding down the road. &ldquo;The driver lost control of his vehicle and hit a wall before crashing into a house. &ldquo;The driver was the only one who was injured. Other neighbours quickly called an ambulance, but he was declared dead at the scene,&rdquo; said the neighbour. Local councillor Bhekabantu Zuma arrived at the crash scene minutes later. &ldquo;The owner of the house stays somewhere else, and luckily her tenants were not home when the incident occurred,&rdquo; said Zuma. &ldquo;When I visited the area, I was told the driver was the owner of the taxi and that he transports schoolkids. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s suspected that the vehicle&rsquo;s brake failed.&rdquo; The incident happened just before noon at Imbali Unit J in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday. Daily Sun could not get comment from the woman who rents one of the rooms. ER24 spokeswoman Annine Dormehl said: &ldquo;Fortunately no one was in the room at the time and no one else sustained injuries as there were no passengers in the taxi.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident. &ldquo;A 51-year-old male driver lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a house. &ldquo;He sustained multiple injuries and was certified dead at the scene. &ldquo;A case of culpable homicide was opened at Plessislaer Police Station for investigation.&rdquo;
