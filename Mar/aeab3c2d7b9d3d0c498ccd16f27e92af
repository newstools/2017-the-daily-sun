TWO police officers and a taxi passenger were injured during a shoot-out between cops and suspected hijackers on Monday afternoon. After running into a block of flats in Alexandra, Joburg the suspects disappeared and the police are pleading with the public to help arrest them. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said the wounded cops and a taxi passenger were taken to hospital. He said the drama started after Metro police spotted a VW Golf 7 they suspected had been hijacked. &ldquo;When the Metro police tried to stop the Golf, the occupants drove away and started shooting at the cops.&rdquo; Makhubela said the suspects got away but were later spotted on the N1 near the Grayston offramp and police gave chase. &ldquo;The gun-wielding suspects shot at civilians in Bramley and the cops fired back. One police officer was shot in the upper body while a taxi passenger also sustained a bullet wound,&rdquo; he said. The suspects then sped off towards Alexandra, where they crashed into another vehicle and hijacked an Audi Q7. A woman and child were injured in the crash. Makhubela said police later found the Audi on 11th Avenue in Alexandra.It had been abandoned and the suspects had fled. He said the police found two rifles and a pistol in the two stolen vehicles.
