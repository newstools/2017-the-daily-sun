AMAJITA coach Thabo Senong will have his work cut out when selecting the 28 players who will battle it out for the ticket to South Korea.The Under-20 squad will have two camps in preparation for the country&rsquo;s third Fifa Under-20 World Cup set to take place between 20 May and 11 June. Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations champions Zambia, Senegal and Guinea will also represent the continent at the global competition. According to Senong, the selection criteria will look at players who helped the team qualify for the recent Afcon in Zambia &ndash; those who took part in the Cosafa Cup last year and the Durban Under-19 International Football Tournament. Said Senong: &ldquo;We will have two camps to form part of our preparation for Korea. The first will be a 15-day selection camp, where we will also have a two-legged friendly game with either the US or Ecuador.&rdquo; The first camp will help the technical staff to trim the team to the final 21 players who will represent Mzansi at the tournament. They will assemble on 4 May before their departure for the Asian country on 6 May, where they will face either Saudi Arabia or Vietnam on 11 May. Senong emphasised the importance of getting to Korea early for the team to acclamatise to conditions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve spent five days over there, when I recently went for the draw, and it was difficult for me to adapt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to leave early, so the players acclimatise to the conditions, get eight hours of sleep and get used to the conditions during training.&rdquo; But Senong was not worried, despite the MultiChoice Diski Challenge being over for the season. He said he was confident players would still be active. Said Senong: &ldquo;Some play in friendlies for their first teams, while others play in the PSL. We will also spend a lot of time with them in camp to help with conditioning them. We know their tactical strengths.&rdquo;
