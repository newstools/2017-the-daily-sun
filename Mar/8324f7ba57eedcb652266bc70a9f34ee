AARON Banda is a very sad man. He used to enjoy drinking coffee while standing at his front door, but he&rsquo;s had to brick it up because water poured in each time it rained. The 84-year-old from Tsebe in Klipgat, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the trouble started in 2000.READ:&nbsp;WATCH: CAGE OF SHAME!&ldquo;Whenever I saw clouds piling up, I knew there wouldn&rsquo;t be any rest for me because the rain would come pouring in through my favourite door,&rdquo; he said. Aaron said because he didn&rsquo;t want to lose his lovely view, he started looking for a solution to the problem. &ldquo;I bought cement and made a stoep, hoping it would prevent the water from reaching my door but that didn&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; he said. Instead, the stoep made matters worse as water would dam up on it and more water would come pouring through his door. &ldquo;I bought more cement to try and make the stoep higher, but none of my efforts helped,&rdquo; he said. Madala Aaron said he even went to the former councillor for help, but his pleas fell on deaf ears, and after 16 years of struggling to solve the problem, he was forced to admit defeat. &ldquo;I had to move the door to the back because nothing I tried worked at the front.&ldquo;I now feel like I live in a cage because I can&rsquo;t see people outside anymore. I need help. I need my front door,&rdquo; he said. Councillor Tshepo Motaung said: &ldquo;I was not aware of the problem. I will try by all means to help him and to make sure he stays happy.&rdquo;
