FALLING in love has left Nomsa Radebe with scars she&rsquo;ll have for the rest of her life . . . Her new boyfriend&rsquo;s jealous baby mama allegedly poured boiling water over her body, leading to her spending eight days in hospital! The 26-year-old said after a month of dating her new man, she went to spend the night at his place in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, at the end of January. But what was supposed to be a relaxed visit turned into a terrifying experience. While Nomsa and her boyfriend were sleeping, the baby mama came knocking on the door the next morning. Soon Nomsa&rsquo;s boyfriend and his former lover were having a heated argument. &ldquo;The two were screaming at each other and I had to intervene,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;After I told the baby mama to keep it down, I left them and went back to bed. The next thing I felt was hot water being poured over my body. &ldquo;I want justice for what happened. The woman is still walking the streets.&rdquo; Vosloorus police confirmed that a case of assault was opened and investigations were continuing.
