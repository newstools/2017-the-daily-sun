SANGOMAS who give muthi to rhino poachers have been warned to watch out . . . Doctor Sylvester Hlathi , head of traditional healers in the Southern African Development Community region, has warned sangomas that they risk being killed by their clients. &ldquo;If they get arrested and charged, what is going to happen to you? The best thing is not to work with criminals,&rdquo; Hlathi said. He said poachers sometimes used muthi to make wild animals sleep so they couldn&rsquo;t see hunters coming. &ldquo;Sometimes the muthi they carry makes the animals less aggressive when they&rsquo;re attacked,&rdquo; he said. Hlathi has been working with South African National Parks to reach out to traditional healers in Limpopo and Mpumalanga to warn them against working with poachers. &ldquo;Get the person arrested. That&rsquo;s the best thing you can do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We used the campaign to educate traditional healers about the dangers of helping criminals. We told them that if their muthi doesn&rsquo;t work and the poachers get arrested, they will come back for revenge. &ldquo;We must stay on the safe side and stop working with them or call the police if they contact us.&rdquo; Isaac Phaahla, SANParks head of marketing, said poachers often had muthi and cellphones in their possession when they were arrested. They had consulted with Hlathi to find out what the muthi was used for.
