WHEN the loving husband couldn&rsquo;t find his wife and child and started receiving SMSes demanding cash for their release, he acted immediately. He told the kidnappers he&rsquo;d meet them, and also called the police. They bust the kidnappers, but when they got to the home to set his wife free, they found her singing and relaxing in the shower! In the end the woman from Lenasia, south of Joburg, was arrested for faking her own kidnapping. The drama started on Wednesday when the husband, in his 30s, arrived home from work to find his wife and his son gone. He called all their relatives but none had heard from them. The following day, after he had opened a case at the Lenasia Police Station, he started receiving SMSes from his wife&rsquo;s cellphone, demanding that he pay R4 000 if he wanted to see his wife and child alive again. He replied that he only had R2 000, and when the kidnappers agreed, they planned a meeting for a handover. Cops tagged along in an unmarked car, and when the suspects arrived, they quickly caught them. On investigation, the men took the police to the house where the woman and child were being kept. Everyone was surprised when the woman was found singing in the shower and the kid was playing computer games. She was arrested and charged with defeating the ends of justice. Moroka SAPS spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said the woman and two men she was allegedly working with were arrested on Thursday and appeared in the Lenasia Magistrates Court on Friday . The suspects are still in custody.
