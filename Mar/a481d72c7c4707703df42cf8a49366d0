THE queues are long and the process can be confusing . . . So some unemployed people have been using agents to register them for Unemployment Insurance Fund benefits!The agents charge R400 for each claim and promise that, with their help, the process will be fast-tracked.But there is a bill in process that seeks to prohibit these agents from acting on behalf of the unemployed.This emerged during the department of labour&rsquo;s media networking session on Wednesday in Polokwane, Limpopo.Beneficiary services deputy director Ronet Landman said using agents can cause a delay in paying claimants. Agents come to the labour centres with boxes full of claimants&rsquo; forms, and some are usually very late, Landman said. She said they sometimes refuse to process claims, which come after six months have expired.&ldquo;Our services are free to everyone. We urge unemployed people to claim their UIF at any labour centre themselves. We now have an eFiling system for those who aren&rsquo;t able to stand in the queues in our centres,&rdquo; said Landman. &ldquo;The R400 you pay the agent can help you since you no longer have an income on a monthly basis.&rdquo;Spokesman Makhosonke Buthelezi said they were trying to improve their services. He emphasised that agents are not members of the department.
