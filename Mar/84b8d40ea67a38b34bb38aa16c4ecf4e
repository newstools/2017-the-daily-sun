MARITZBURG United players are wary of struggling Ajax Cape Town ahead of their Absa Premiership duel tomorrow at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg (8.15pm).And this would be Fadlu Davids&rsquo; big return to the bench following the sudden departure of Roger de Sa from the Team of Choice.The Urban Warriors are currently occupying position 12 while Team of Choice are 10th. They are separated by a single point and United&rsquo;s attacking midfielder Lebohang Maboe understands the importance of getting all three points in this match. He said: &ldquo;Ajax have a lot to play for in this match. Things haven&rsquo;t been a smooth sailing for them too. I must admit, this is not going to be an easy match for us. Yes, we are playing at home but that doesn&rsquo;t mean things will go our way.&rdquo;United have already beaten Ajport United ax this season in the first round but Maboe reckons Ajax have a point to prove and they will come spitting fire. &ldquo;The fact that we have beaten them at home already this season will encourage them more. They will come at us with the revenge mentality.&rdquo;The 22-year-old, however said they also have few tricks up in their sleeves. He said: &ldquo;For us this a must win match. In these last nine remaining matches we&rsquo;ve told ourselves that we have to fight for every point on offer. But having said that coach Fadlu told us not to put pressure on ourselves. He said it is important for us to take a game at a time. That goal is to end the in top six.&rdquo;
