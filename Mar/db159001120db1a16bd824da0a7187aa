CAPE Town City will play with no fear when they host defending Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the Cape Town Stadium in what promises to be a juicy top-of-the-table clash on Friday (8pm).Tinkler&rsquo;s Citizens have been the surprise package this season, keeping pace with the leading pack and winning the Telkom Knockout earlier this year.The coach has high regard for the Brazilians and head coach Pitso Mosimane: &ldquo;They are a class act. They are not the PSL and African champions for nothing. But we will play with no pressure on us. &ldquo;We beat them 2-1 at Loftus in the first round and fancy giving them a run for their money in Cape Town. Somebody has to stop them.&ldquo;Sundowns strengthened their defence with the signing of two really good defenders in Ricardo Nascimento (Brazil) and Algerian Fares Hachi.&rdquo;Tinkler has not set his sights on winning the league just yet. He has given his players a target of 46 points. He said: &ldquo;I reckon 46 points will see us comfortably in the top eight and maybe even in the top five. Once we get to that target I will see how much higher we can aim.&rdquo;The coach reckons SuperSport United are the other main title contenders.He will have a full squad with the return to duty of striker Judas Moseamedi and veteran defender Robyn Johannes, who missed the weekend 3-0 rout of bottom club Baroka FC in Polokwane.Tinkler also has classy defender Vincent Kobola back fit after a recent long injury lay-off. Kabola is fighting to regain his place in the defence.Explained Tinkler: &ldquo;Thamsanqa Mkhize has been in such good form that he has kept Kobola on the bench.&rdquo;
