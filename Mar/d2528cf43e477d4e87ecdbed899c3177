EFF leader Julius Malema has been banned from calling for illegal land grabs. The North Gauteng High Court in Tshwane yesterday granted an interdict to civil and business rights groups, AfriForum and AfriBusiness. The application was submitted in November last year after Malema encouraged EFF members to take unoccupied land illegally. Tarien Cooks, safety co-ordinator for AfriForum, said yesterday that the EFF was asked last year to stop encouraging land grabs, as it was a criminal offence. The EFF reacted to the request, sent in a letter from AfriForum, by saying land would be taken without compensation and redistributed. Armand Greyling, law and policy analyst for AfriBusiness, said: &ldquo;AfriBusiness views private land ownership as one of the cornerstones of a flourishing economy based on the free market system. &ldquo;Any threat to, or undermining of, private land ownership will deter local and international investors, and lead to money flowing out of the country.&rdquo;Cooks said if Malema or any member of the EFF did not obey the interdict, they would be charged with contempt of court. Malema has also been charged with going against the Riotous Assemblies Act of 1956. This was after he made a call at the party&rsquo;s elective conference in Bloemfontein in 2014 for supporters to occupy land. He repeated the call in Newcastle, KZN last year. Malema is expected to appear in court in Newcastle on 5 May. He has tried to lodge an application with the Constitutional Court to have the apartheid-era act and the charges against him declared unconstitutional.EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi had not responded to Daily Sun&rsquo;s inquiry at the time of going to print.
