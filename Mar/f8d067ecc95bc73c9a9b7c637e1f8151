That evening, Metro cops arrived at the family home of the 19-year-old to inform her parents that she had been stabbed to death! Police suspect that Makgatliso, from Rockville in Soweto, was stabbed multiple times, allegedly by her 21-year-old boyfriend, who later handed himself in.

Her other sister, Nomthandazo Phangela (30) said Makgatliso was a lovely person. &ldquo;She was more than a sister to me.
