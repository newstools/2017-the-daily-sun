COMMUTERS from Mukoma A sina Nndu, outside Thohoyandou, in Limpopo had a close shave with death yesterday. This was after the bus they were travelling in burst into flames.The bus, which belongs to Omega Busliner, was ferrying students and workers to Vhembe TVET College when it was completely gutted by fire.The incident happened at about 8am as the bus entered Sibasa. A witness who was standing at a nearby bus stop said he saw smoke on the front wheels as the bus drove past.&ldquo;I thought the brake pads were faulty but I couldn&rsquo;t notify the driver as he drove past. &ldquo;Then a short distance from us we saw smoke coming from the bus,&rdquo; said a witness.Bus driver Phineas Maluleke said he drove from Mukoma, picking up passengers without any problem. He said: &ldquo;Many of the passengers got out in Thohoyandou and just over 20, mostly students, remained. Just as we were about to enter Sibasa we heard a loud bang, followed by heavy black smoke. &ldquo;There was a commotion in the bus as everyone ran for their lives. Luckily no one was injured in the rush,&rdquo; he said.Phineas said firefighters had arrived at the scene but the fire spread quickly, consuming the whole bus.&ldquo;I have never come across this in my driving career. I am still in shock but I praise God for saving me and my passengers.&rdquo; Bus owner Pandelani Mathivha said: &ldquo;We suspect the damage was hastened by the body being made of fibreglass, which burns easily. We are just happy that no one was injured during the incident.&rdquo;He said the damage was estimated to be about R700 000. &ldquo;We want to assure our passengers that this incident was beyond our control. We have been in business for nearly 30 years and we have the best fleet, which is insured, as well as trained drivers to take care of them on their travels.&rdquo;
