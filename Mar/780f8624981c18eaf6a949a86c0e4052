THE country&rsquo;s first dedicated sex toy industry survey reveals that over three-quarters (76,7%) of the respondents use sex toys. The biggest reason for the 23,3% of the sample who don&rsquo;t use toys is ignorance &ndash; rather than being embarrassed or ashamed to use them.The survey was conducted by D&eacute;sir, the South African luxury sex toy e-commerce store.The findings also reveal that 42,9% of users buy their sex toys online, and only 20,7% buy from shops.The survey found that the main reason 44,4% of people gave for buying sex toys was to spice up their sex life.And 17,5% of respondents bought toys because they wanted to introduce something new into their sex lives.D&eacute;sir MD Brodie Meyer told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Given the buying patterns and growth in couples&rsquo; sex toy sales, there&rsquo;s definitely a new trend.&ldquo;Mzansi is in line with an evolving global sex toy market, which is changing from a dark, secretive and explicit industry to one of innovation, openness and acceptance,&rdquo; she said.For businesswoman Lucky Modise, experimenting with sex toys ensures that she and her partner have fun while making love.&ldquo;As black people, we need to stop seeing lovemaking and everything that comes with this act as something that&rsquo;s filthy and degrading.&ldquo;I brought up the topic, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a slut just because I was able to raise my curiosity in the relationship,&rdquo; she said.Lucky added that she and her partner have also visited an adult sex shop together &ndash; and this has increased their intimacy levels.Muntu Maseko from Soweto said he&rsquo;s open-minded and doesn&rsquo;t mind whatever his partner brIngs into the bedroom.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re adults who are in a relationship and we should be able to meet each other&rsquo;s sexual needs in a more matured manner. I go to gym and that gives me a healthy libido. If my woman brings up sex toys, why would I judge her for something that will enhance her sexual satisfaction?&ldquo;As men, we need to stop name-calling women who speak up on their needs as whores, loose or being easy,&rdquo; he said.He added that men are more promiscuous than women, yet men are celebrated for such behaviour and women are labelled for the sexual choices they make in stable relationships.Brodie said: &ldquo;The non-user group responses confirmed many outdated biases and stigmas that challenge us. People want to be able to buy sex toys in non-judgemental environments that aren&rsquo;t associated with smut or porn.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a lot of shame around sexuality and sexual expression and must change. We&rsquo;ll continue fighting negative sentiment and educate people more and thisraise their awareness about sexual health &ndash; to free them from sexual prisons.&rdquo;
