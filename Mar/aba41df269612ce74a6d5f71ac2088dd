THE ANCYL and Andile Lungisa are among those who have hit back following the political drama that unfolded yesterday at Ahmed Kathrada&rsquo;s funeral."It is heart-breaking to see the funeral of this revolutionary colossal and servant of our people being turned into factional pornography and grandstanding by otherwise honourable leaders," wrote Lungisa, who is former Nelson Mandela Bay ANC chairman.The media had been "gleeful and wasted no time in being an echo chamber for our [the ANC's] painful division"."Uncle Kathy", as the liberation hero was fondly known, died in the early hours of Tuesday morning following a short illness. He was 87.Former deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe, Gauteng Premier David Makhura, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe, SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande, and Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali were some of the speakers at the funeral yesterday.President Jacob Zuma did not attend. The Kathrada family had apparently asked that he didn&rsquo;t.Several speakers criticised the current crop of ANC leaders. Motlanthe read excerpts from an open letter Kathrada had written to Zuma in 2016, asking him to step down.The ANC Youth League expressed anger that Zuma was "practically barred" from the funeral.It said Ahmed Kathrada Foundation director Neeshan Balton had "shamelessly" used his position to bar Zuma from attending the funeral of his own comrade. "Even washed-up pensioned politicians who are still to recover from the Mangaung hangover have found themselves unable to contain their hatred for the president," said the league.They vowed to protect Zuma and urged him to go through with the rumoured Cabinet reshuffle which, according to speculation, could see him fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/factional-pornography-and-a-soft-coup-zuma-allies-slam-kathrada-funeral-speakers-20170330
