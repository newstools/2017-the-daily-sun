A WOMAN is fighting for her life in hospital after she was brutally attacked, allegedly by her ex-lover. The 42-year-old from Refilwe in Cullinan, Tshwane, fought to free herself from the hands of her attacker, but he was too strong and repeatedly stabbed her. The man only fled after he heard a neighbour calling for help. Community members said they were woken by a very loud knock on Saturday morning. Resident Phindile Mashaba (40) said she opened the door to see what was going on and saw the victim&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend. &ldquo;I screamed at her not to open and I was relieved when she didn&rsquo;t. However, he soon broke down the door and entered her shack. &ldquo;I followed him inside but he overpowered me, got hold of her and started stabbing her. I ran outside and screamed for help.&rdquo; She said by the time residents arrived, the victim was lying in a pool of blood and her attacker had fled. Phindile said the victim and her ex-boyfriend had been fighting since they broke up two years ago. Apparently, he was so violent that the victim was forced to get a protection order against him. The victim&rsquo;s sister said she went out looking for the ex-boyfriend with a group of other women. &ldquo;When we found him we called the police, but we taught him a lesson before we handed him over,&rdquo; she said. Spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi said a suspect was arrested on Monday.He appeared in the Cullinan Magistrates Court on charges of intimidation and attempted murder on Wednesday. The case was postponed.
