THE SAFA refereeing department will have to be vigilant tomorrow when ABC Motsepe League Gauteng clubs play their last round of matches to determine the club heading to the national play-offs.It has come to SunSport&rsquo;s attention that dirty tricks by referees and administrators&rsquo; match-fixing scandals are in the spotlight yet again.Daily Sun has seen SMSes from a title-chasing side, who won&rsquo;t be named now, requesting a meeting with Moroka Swallows officials, allegedly in the hope of offering Birds players money to double their efforts and ensure they keep their opponents at bay.The unnamed team, whose identity is known to SunSport, hopes to ensure that Orange Vaal Professionals, who are second in the Gauteng log table, lose the match to allow the side a chance to leapfrog them.This comes after our sister paper, City Press, reported on Sunday that the match between Maccabi FC and Vaal Professionals at the Dick Fourie Stadium in Vereeniging was under scrutiny for match-fixing.This could result in Maccabi FC, who currently lead the standings, facing the wrath of the Safa DC and could see the team second on points declared champions.Two of SunSport&rsquo;s sources who are players at Swallows, said they received invites via SMS to a meeting with club officials, but that the agenda for the meeting had not been specified.&ldquo;We (Swallows) are about to be relegated and would rather die with clean hands. My concern is referees who can be a bit dodgy,&rdquo; said a Swallows player ahead of their last game of the season against Orange Vaal Professionals.Said another source: &ldquo;This is a dangerous game. Some of us have received envelopes with nasty messages and a spent bullet cartridge inside.&rdquo; While refusing to reveal their modus operandi, Safa head of referees Peter Sejake said they would keep a beady eye on all ABC Motsepe matches tomorrow.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at these issues and working closely with our integrity officer, Mlungisa Ncane, as well as the SA police,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Match-fixers have now moved away from bribing referees &ndash; they are now going straight to players and managers.&rdquo;He said they would only appoint their referees just before the matches kick off to avoid any thuggery. Meanwhile, Ga-Rankuwa United will again be holding the cards to Swallows&rsquo; survival when they play 14th placed Vaal Professionals, who have 26 points. Swallows are 15th in the standings with 24 points and victory over Orange Vaal Professionals will steer them to 13th thanks to goal difference. But that will only be possible if M.Tigers, who are currently 13th with 27 points, also lose their match.
