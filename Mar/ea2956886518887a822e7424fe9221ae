SOUTH African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan has pulled out of the race to become a member of the Fifa Council.South Sudan&rsquo;s Chabur Goc Alei has also withdrawn from the race, as he did in 2016, while Zambian Kalusha Bwalya abandoned his bid over the weekend too.The withdrawals were revealed in a letter sent by the Confederation of African Football (Caf) to the continent&rsquo;s member associations.Caf confirmed the eligibility of 10 candidates for next week&rsquo;s elections.This comes after Fifa&rsquo;s governance committee approved their candidacy following eligibility checks, which Fifa introduced following the corruption scandal of 2015.Topping the list are Caf president Issa Hayatou and Madagascar FA head Ahmad Ahmad, the Cameroonian&rsquo;s sole challenger in the presidential elections on 16 March.Whoever wins the presidential vote in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa will automatically assume a vice-presidential role on the Fifa Council.Following the withdrawal of Jordaan, Goc and Bwalya, eight contestants are left to bid for the six further African places on the council.One of these will go to Burundi&rsquo;s Lydia Nsekera, who is assured her place since Fifa stipulates there must be at least one woman from the continent as member. She is the sole woman among the applicants.Five of the remaining contestants already sit on the Fifa Council, Tarek Bouchamoui (Tunisia), Almamy Kabele Camara (Guinea), Kwesi Nyantakyi (Ghana), Constant Omari (DR Congo), and Hany Abo Rida (Egypt).Meanwhile, both Augustin Sidy Diallo of Ivory Coast and Tanzania&rsquo;s Leodegar Tenga are bidding to be elected for the first time. The successful candidates will all serve on the council for four years until 2021. &ndash; BBC
