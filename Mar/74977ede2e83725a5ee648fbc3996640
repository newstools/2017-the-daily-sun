THE curse of adult men and teachers making high school girls pregnant is widespread and well known. But the evil has now spread to girls as young as eight in primary schools. The basic education department&rsquo;s response to a question by the DA in Parliament last week revealed that 193 Mzansi schoolgirls from grades 3, 4 and 5 fell pregnant between 2014 and 2016. According to the DA, that number rises to 1 449 if girls from grades 6 and 7 are included. Sonja Boshoff, the party&rsquo;s member of the portfolio committee on basic education, said it was not clear how many of the victims were from KZN. She said keeping children at school was a major priority, no matter their circumstances, so they could live a life filled with opportunities. Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for Mthandeni Dlungwana, the MEC for the KZN Education Department, said the support of residents was necessary to prevent pupil pregnancies. &ldquo;It is true that kids from grades 3, 4 and 5 fell pregnant and that is why we appeal to parents and residents to work with us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Men who make young girls pregnant are known in their areas and must be reported to cops so they can be arrested.&rdquo; Mthethwa said the department will continue to expel teachers implicated in such incidents. It will also open criminal charges against them. &ldquo;Parents and residents should stop being silent on this matter. We are tired of old men luring young girls into sex by offering luxury items. &ldquo;The pregnancies happen in both rural and urban areas, but it mostly affects rural pupils,&rdquo; he said.
