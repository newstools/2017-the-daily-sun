NOKUTHULA Gumede says evil spirits are tearing her family apart! She told Daily Sun the supernatural problems the family was facing had caused bitterness between her daughter and two grandchildren. The 55-year-old mum from Dlamini, in Soweto said she suspected jealous people had sent misfortune her way to split up her family. Things started going wrong in January and got really bad last month when her daughter (30) ran off with a man who is twice her age. A relative also tried to commit suicide and neighbours had to put out a fire that started burning in her house out of nowhere.&ldquo;Our lives are a mess. Everything bad that you could possibly think of is happening to us day in and day out,&rdquo; said Nokuthula. &ldquo;My children have also turned against me and I don&rsquo;t know how this happened. We don&rsquo;t respect each other any more here and people do as they please. I need help before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;The SunTeam approached Gauteng Social Development and spokeswoman Mbangwa Xaba promised to send social workers to the family to check what could be the problem.Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini said the family&rsquo;s problems were caused by evil people who wanted to do harm.
