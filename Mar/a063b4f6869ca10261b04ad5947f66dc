He commended his charges for the bravery they showed in their 1-0 victory over struggling Highlands Park in an Absa Premiership match at Makhulong Stadium on Saturday.Baxter said: &ldquo;It was a good evening for us against Highlands. We showed a lot of discipline when we had the ball and also off the ball, despite tough conditions due to the rain. Certainly I think we could have banged in another three goals but it was not meant to be.&ldquo;We also cannot be looking at how many games in hand Sundowns have. What we need to do is work and worry about our effectiveness going into the next game.&rdquo;Matsatsantsa a Pitori have gone 17 games unbeaten in the league and are top of the pack with 35 points from 18 matches. They have played three games more than Sundowns.They last lost a game in August last year when they were beaten 1-0 by Platinum Stars in their opening league match. The British mentor insisted that his charges were not feeling any pressure as a result of their exceptional run in the league so far. He said: &ldquo;There is no pressure on our side. Pressure is on the teams that have gone 15 games without a win. &ldquo;On our side we like what we see and hope it continues until the end of the season.&rdquo;
