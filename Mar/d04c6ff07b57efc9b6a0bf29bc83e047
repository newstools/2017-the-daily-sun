THOKO couldn&rsquo;t understand what was happening to her panties. Thieves could not get into her house, yet her panties kept on disappearing. She even suspected tokoloshes and consulted sangomas, but she did not get any answers.Then the answer presented itself to Thoko Masimula (39) from Jerusalem squatter camp in Roodepoort, Gauteng.She said she was tired and resting on her bed after coming from a funeral.&ldquo;I was not asleep, just trying to relax, when I saw two big black rats dragging one of my red panties from the wardrobe drawer and under the bed.&rdquo;When Thoko checked under the bed, the rats and her panties were nowhere to be found.&ldquo;There is no hole under the bed. I thought I would catch them once they went in there, but they just disappeared.&rdquo; &ldquo;These could be evil rats sent by evil people to wreck my life,&rdquo; she said.Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkulu told Daily Sun this could be the doings of a jealous lover sending rats to steal Thoko&rsquo;s panties.Thoko said the only person she suspected was her former boyfriend, with whom she broke up about three years ago.&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t take our break-up very well,&rdquo; she said.Thoko said she has menstrual problems and she has bad luck when it comes to men.&ldquo;I thought the bleeding was just normal, but now I suspect the rats might have something to do with it.&rdquo;She said men always run away from her immediately after their first or second date. &ldquo;The only long relationship I have had was with that boyfriend.&rdquo; Mthimkulu said Thoko must burn muthi that will prevent the rats from coming back.&ldquo;She will have to be cleansed as well,&rdquo; he said.
