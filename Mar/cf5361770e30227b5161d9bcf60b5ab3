EACH squatter claims to have paid R1150 for a place to stay. But yesterday, the hopeful land occupiers from Skomplaas near Modder East in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, realised they had been conned.The land they thought was theirs actually belongs to the Ekurhuleni Municipality. The residents couldn&rsquo;t accept they had been scammed. Instead, they had a standoff with the cops and the Red Ants who had been sent to remove them. In the end, several people were injured and others arrested. Police had to use rubber bullets.&ldquo;We are told this land is not safe for human habitation. The worst thing is that the people who sold us the land are nowhere to be found. &ldquo;They have run away, leaving us in this mess. We are told some of them were seen loading their goods on trucks on Tuesday. Obviously they knew this was coming,&rdquo; one residents claimed.According to a community leader, about 5000 people were removed by the Red Ants. They have vowed to hunt down the sellers to get their money back.Elvis Mhlongo told Daily Sun he borrowed R3500 from the bank thinking he was investing in his new property.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost everything now.&rdquo; Elvis is not the only one who claims to have borrowed money. Others claimed they were forced to borrow from mashonisas. They watched in horror as the Red Ants destroyed their shacks.Captain Johannes Ramphora from the Springs Police Station confirmed the incident and said more than 10 residents were arrested.&ldquo;We are still waiting for a report on the incident,&rdquo; he said. Themba Radebe, the Ekurhuleni spokesman, said the municipality decided to remove all squatters who live near mine shafts. This after a five-year-old boy fell into a disused shafted last week near Jerusalem squatter camp, Bokburg.&ldquo;Residents of Skomplaas, who were removed, live near the Gold One mine in Modder East,&rdquo; said Radebe.
