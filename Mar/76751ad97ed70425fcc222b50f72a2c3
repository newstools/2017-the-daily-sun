MANCHESTER United should focus on winning the Europa League this season, which would bring the Red Devils a trophy they have never won and secure qualification for next season&rsquo;s Champions League, former manager Alex Ferguson has said.United are fifth in the Premier League and sit four points behind fourth-placed Liverpool, though they have two games in hand on the Merseyside club.A top-four finish would ensure Champions League qualification but Ferguson, who was in charge at Old Trafford for some 27 years, believes United have a great opportunity to qualify by winning Europe&rsquo;s second-tier club competition.&ldquo;The thing is, we&rsquo;ve never won the Europa League,&rdquo; he told ESPN. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never won the Uefa Cup, what it used to be. And we&rsquo;ve got a great draw. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a certainty, but they&rsquo;ve got a great chance.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a European trophy. And if you win it, you get into the Champions League. The incentive is greater to do that.&rdquo;English clubs have not won a European title since Chelsea&rsquo;s Champions League win in 2012.Ferguson, who won two Champions League trophies and a Cup Winners&rsquo; Cup at United, said success on the European front was cyclical.&ldquo;In the 1970s, Ajax and Bayern Munich; in the 1980s Liverpool; in the 1990s Italy, AC Milan. And then England had a great spell,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;At the moment, the cycle is with the Spanish teams. And they&rsquo;re best, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re winning it.United visit Belgian outfit Anderlecht in the first leg of their Europa League quarterfinal on 13 April before hosting the return a week later. &ndash; REUTERS
