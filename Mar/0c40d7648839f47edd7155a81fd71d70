ON 11 February Selina Tsotetsi (19) gave birth to her first baby.However, according to the new mother, her joy was shortlived when she discovered that her baby boy&rsquo;s hand was broken. The mum from Freedom Park near Rustenburg, North West blames nurses at Tlhabane Clinic for allegedly breaking her baby&rsquo;s hand. Selina said she gave birth at the clinic before being transferred to Job Shimankana Tabane Hospital in Rustenburg.She said: &ldquo;When I asked them what happened they shouted at me, saying I was the one responsible.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how I could have broken my baby&rsquo;s hand before I could even hold him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened and when I demanded an explanation from the nurses, I was told to shut up because I talked too much.&rdquo; Selina claimed her baby cries non-stop because he is in pain. &ldquo;All I want is to know what happened to him.&rdquo; Selina&rsquo;s mother, Annah Tsotetsi (44), a mother of nine, said it was very difficult to get through the day because she had to help Selina with the baby at night. &ldquo;It should be a joyous time, having a newborn in the house, but instead it is painful, seeing the baby in so much pain.&rdquo; North West Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said the department was not aware of the matter. He promised that the department would investigate.
