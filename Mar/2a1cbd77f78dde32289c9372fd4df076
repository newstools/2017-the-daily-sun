WHEN Martha saw her house was on fire, her first thought was that her two young children were in the RDP.Martha Sithole (29) from Winterveld, Tshwane said: &ldquo;When I saw the raging flames, my worst fear was that my boys were trapped inside.&ldquo;I was so grateful they were smart enough to run outside.&rdquo;It appears it took only one match to destroy Martha&rsquo;s four-roomed house last Thursday.Martha said she left her two boys, aged five and two, in the house when she took her seven-year-old to school.But when she returned she was greeted by flames.&ldquo;I had been away for less than 10 minutes,&rdquo; she said.Martha said the fire may have been started by a match that fell on the blankets.Martha&rsquo;s husband, Johannes Sithole (48), said he left the house to look for a piece job. He said he received a phone call telling him his house was on fire.Johannes said: &ldquo;I thought it was a joke, but I rushed home and it was true. Everything in the house was destroyed. We have nothing but the clothes we are wearing. I am grateful my children were not harmed.&rdquo;The Sithole family said they are thankful for the help they received from their neighbours.Councillor Esther Mutumane said they will help the family renovate the house and apply for the important documents that were burned in the blaze.She said: &ldquo;We appeal to the community to make sure matches or other flammable items are not left near unsupervised children.&rdquo;
