SINCE their owner died, the orphaned goats have been looking after themselves.They leave their kraal in the morning, without a shepherd, to graze in the veld.Late in the afternoon they come back to the makeshift kraal in Bekkersdal, Gauteng, to snuggle up and go to sleep.The owner, identified only as Jantjie, died last year in August after a short illness .&ldquo;We believe the owner is looking after them from the heavens,&rdquo; said a resident Tshepo Molomo, as the 20 goats crossed the road to graze.&ldquo;It is as if they are guided by someone. It&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo;Tshepo told Daily Sun it&rsquo;s not surprising that thugs don&rsquo;t steal them. &ldquo;They better not. It is dangerous to steal other people&rsquo;s livestock. Some people use muthi, so if you kill them and eat the meat, you may get sick,&rdquo; said Tshepo.&ldquo;People fear coming close because those goats are looked after by the ancestors.&rdquo;Resident Joseph Ndlovu said the owner loved his livestock. &ldquo;When he died, we worried about who would look after them. The goats became confused as they were used to having him around. &ldquo;But now they have settled down. It looks as if they are well taken care of.&rdquo;Another resident said the goats are also breeding and increasing in number.
