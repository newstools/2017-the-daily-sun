MARITZBURG United and Free State Stars get a chance to set the record straight this weekend.The Team of Choice lost 1-0 to Golden Arrows in a KwaZulu-Natal Absa Premiership derby last weekend, while Ea Lla Koto were beaten 1-0 at Goble Park by Highlands Park.This weekend signals round two for the four clubs as they compete in the Last 32 of the Nedbank Cup, with the same teams meeting for a second time.Arrows and Maritzburg clash at Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban on Sunday (3pm), while Stars host Highlands in their Last 32 showdown at Goble Park tomorrow (8.15pm).Arrows coach Clinton Larsen said: &ldquo;If the last few matches between these two teams are anything to go by, this will be a closely contested match.&rdquo;Larsen also said he expected United to throw everything at them. &ldquo;I think there will be the added element for them of a grudge to be settled in this match after we beat them a week ago. For us, we would like to progress in the competition, as this is our chance to do well in a cup competition this season,&rdquo; he said. Team of Choice coach Roger de Sa will rely on his experience in cup competitions in this match. But he admits he expects it to be a cagey affair. &ldquo;Personally, I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed playing the same team twice so close together. I&rsquo;ve played the same team twice in two-legged tournaments but there was always another game in-between,&rdquo; said De Sa, who won the cup with Bidvest Wits in 2010. He added: &ldquo;This will be a cat-and-mouse scenario. It will be one of those matches where both coaches play their cards close to their chests.&rdquo;
