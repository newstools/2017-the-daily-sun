EVERY day is filled with pain for Thoko Sishi. This is because the 48-year-old from Folweni, south of Durban, fears her four-roomed mud house could collapse on her family at any time. Thoko lives with her 78-year-old mum Ntombikayise, who suffered a stroke last year, and her 41-year-old brother Nhlanhla, who is mentally ill. She said the house was damaged by storms in July last year and by the recent heavy rain. &ldquo;It feels like we&rsquo;re living outside. When it rains water comes in from all sides and when it&rsquo;s windy we feel it. This life is very painful.&rdquo;When the SunTeam visited the family, there were holes in the sides of their house, which Thoko had tried to cover with rusty corrugated iron. Thoko said she had been unable to work since her mum had the stroke as she had to take care of her and her brother. Thoko said after the house was damaged in July, she contacted Councillor Thembelihle Makhanya, who promised to help but nothing has happened. She said she contacted the councillor again a few weeks ago. &ldquo;She came to look at the house and promised to get us help but when I call her she doesn&rsquo;t pick up the phone.&rdquo; Councillor Makhanya said she was aware of Thoko&rsquo;s situation and was dealing with it. She promised to contact her to give her an update. Charmel Payet, eThekwini municipal spokeswoman, said Thoko&rsquo;s situation was being assessed. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make commitments before a proper assessment is done to check whether she qualifies for subsidised housing.&rdquo;
