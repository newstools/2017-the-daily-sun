THE SACP, and a few top ANC leaders were able to prevent Mzansi from falling over an economic cliff by advising President Jacob Zuma not to fire his finance minister. This was revealed by the Communist Party&rsquo;s deputy general-secretary, Solly Mapaila, in Braamfontein yesterday, when he gave details of a bilateral meeting between the SACP and the ANC leadership. Mapaila said the SACP now wanted the tripartite alliance to be reconfigured to curb the president&rsquo;s powers. He confirmed that Zuma informed a bilateral meeting between the ANC leadership and the SACP that he intended to fire Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, confirming rumours that Gordhan&rsquo;s investor roadshow in the UK and US had been cut short in order to fire him. Mapaila confirmed Zuma had informed them that he wanted to replace Gordhan with former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe. &ldquo;We recorded our objection to the reshuffle. Appointing Molefe would mean South Africans were not being taken seriously.&rdquo; He said Molefe was tainted by the public protector&rsquo;s investigation leading to the state capture report. Mapaila could not say which names were discussed as a possible replacement for Gordhan. He said the SACP rejected the reasons given by Zuma for the firing of Gordhan. He said Zuma told them he was acting on an intelligence report that said Gordhan would be meeting with forces that wanted to overthrow the government. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pathetic to believe that a minister on a roadshow would be on a trip against the country. We should not be treated like children, really.&rdquo; Mapaila said they had been informed before Molefe went to parliament, but they kept quiet. He could not reveal which of the ANC leaders joined them to reject the president&rsquo;s reshuffle. Mapaila said the party would hold an imbizo in Gauteng from 22 to 24 April to confront challenges facing the movement.
