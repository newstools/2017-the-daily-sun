HUNDREDS of Ace Parking workers protested outside mayor Herman Mashaba&rsquo;s offices yesterday. They want the City of Joburg to hire them directly rather than outsourcing their work, and told Daily Sun their employer&rsquo;s contract expired in December. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what we were supposed to do,&rdquo; said strike leader Magdeline Mabusela (37). She said last month their equipment was confiscated and Metro cops chased them away. &ldquo;For every R100 paid for parking, I used to get R20. The little I got was all I had to support my family with.&rdquo; Mametlwe Sebei from the Workers and Socialist Party said: &ldquo;If the municipality doesn&rsquo;t consider doing this, families will go hungry and we will blame Mashaba. He&rsquo;s supposed to be the father of the city.&rdquo; Parking company spokesman Ferdinand Ndi said they were aware of the protest but weren&rsquo;t sure what it was about. &ldquo;We are trying to negotiate an extension of our contract. We don&rsquo;t know why our employees have marched to the mayor&rsquo;s office.&rdquo; Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said cops were monitoring the situation. Numerous attempts to get hold of the mayor&rsquo;s office failed.
