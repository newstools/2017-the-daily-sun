Gavin Hunt insists being constantly linked with the Bafana Bafana post is not distracting him from his job, although he does concede the "speculation can be tiring".Hunt is seen by many as the perfect man to take over from the sacked Shakes Mashaba although he has not been approached by the South African Football Association.A number of potential coaches including Carlos Queiroz, Herve Renard and Hugo Broos have all been linked with the job, and despite SAFA insisting that a new man would be in place this week, the organisaton appears no closer to be able to unveil their new man.And speaking ahead of his side's CAF Champions League clash with Al Ahly on Saturday, Hunt said: "It&rsquo;s no distraction at all."Obviously they (Safa) are going about things their own way. No-one has ever spoken to me about the job, so it not a distraction although the speculation can be tiring.&rdquo;And on facing the Egyptian giants, he added: "They are a big institution, and not just a football club. And the players have been looking forward to this game for some time, which is nice for a change because we all know that generally that is not the case.&nbsp;"I am not sure how we are going to react, but to win this would be great for this club because we have to create that type of mentality in South Africa, that we want to play in these tournaments.&rdquo;
