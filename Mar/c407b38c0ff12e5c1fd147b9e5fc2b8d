THE feud over the naming rights of FNB Stadium has been finally resolved.&nbsp;The impasse between FNB and Stadium Management SA (SMSA), the company tasked with the management of Mzansi&rsquo;s biggest stadium, seem to have been settled after FNB agreed to renew and pay for the rights going forward.&nbsp;SunSport can reveal that FNB will be paying in the region of R14&thinsp;million per annum for the next five to 10 years. This means that if the deal goes on for 10 years, it will be worth R140&thinsp;million.&nbsp;The FNB Stadium is the Mecca of Mzansi football, where the country&rsquo;s biggest soccer games take place. It&rsquo;s currently the home of Mzansi glamour club, Kaizer Chiefs. Bafana Bafana also play their big matches at the venue.&nbsp;The stadium also hosted the opening and the finals of the historic 2010 Fifa World Cup. In 2013, the venue was also used for the Afcon opening match between South Africa and Cape Verde, and the final where Nigeria defeated Burkina Faso.&nbsp;During the two soccer tournaments, the state-of-the-art soccer venue was named Soccer City, in a bid to avoid a clash with sponsors of the World Cup and Afcon.&nbsp;One of the requirements from Fifa and Caf was that venues should be brand-free during tournaments.&nbsp;The gigantic 87&thinsp;000-seater has also organised world class international music concerts like Lady Gaga, U2, Justin Bieber and Rihanna.&nbsp;SMSA has held discussions with various interested parties who wanted to clinch the sought-after naming rights. It is alleged that a well known medical aid company, a soccer-crazy banking institution and an overzealous cellphone provider had shown interest in getting their fingers on the pie.&nbsp;The FNB and Stadium Management feud dates back to 2010 when SMSA were appointed by the City of Joburg to run the stadium, and others including, Orlando, Dobsonville and Rand stadiums.&nbsp;After the 2010 World Cup, the High Court prevented SMSA from referring to the venue by any name other than FNB Stadium.&nbsp;Later in December, the Supreme Court of Appeal Court gave FNB the sole rights to name the soccer stadium. When the FNB naming rights ended in 2012, bank negotiated and extend for another year in exchange for relinquishing the stadium name for the 2013 Afcon.&nbsp;In 2014, FNB was renewed for 24 months, ending July 2016. Then, there were extensions until January 2017, which was pushed by another two months, and that came to an end midweek on 6 March.&nbsp;Then, this past week, SMSA and FNB entered into a long-term relationship starting with five years. The aim is to go for a period of 10 years.
