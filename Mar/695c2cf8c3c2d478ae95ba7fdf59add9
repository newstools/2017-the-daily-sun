AFTER he ended his athletics season in tears last year, Mzansi&rsquo;s star long jumper, Rushwal Samaai, is determined to rediscover his best form this season after his injury during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&nbsp;The African Senior Athletics Championships gold medallist is ready to dust off his Olympic disappointment as he prepares for the new season.&nbsp;Samaai made the Olympic long jump final starting list, but was unable to perform to his best level due to the injury that he sustained during the event. He sobbed uncontrollably afterwards as he was expected to secure a podium finish.&nbsp;But he says he has now put that setback behind him as he looks forward to the new season.&nbsp;The 25-year-old will compete in his first official competition at the Athletics SA Speed Series meeting in Germiston on 22 March.&nbsp;In May, Samaai will also compete at a meeting in Shanghai, China, before taking part in a European meeting at the beginning of June.&nbsp;Samaai, who is sponsored by Panasonic, has been working hard in training and he says that he is in the best possible condition.&nbsp;Samaai has been practising his run ups to avoid stepping over the line during jumping events.&nbsp;He is hoping to qualify for the IAAF World Championships in London in August.&nbsp;But the competition for places in the squad that will represent SA in England is tough.&nbsp;There are only few places available for long jump and only the best jumpers will be able to book their plane ticket to the London showpiece.&nbsp;Veteran lanky jumper, Khotso Mokoena, Olympic silver medallist, Luvo Manyonga, and Commonwealth silver medallist Zarck Visser, who has just recovered from a long-term injury, are competing for places in the long jump team heading for London.&nbsp;Samaai said: &ldquo;I live for competition and I&rsquo;m excited for the year. I hope to stay injury-free. I have so much potential and I know that I have to pull up my socks because of the tough competition this season.&nbsp;&ldquo;My coach and I are working hard to fix those little things. I can&rsquo;t wait to open my season in Germiston.&rdquo;&nbsp;
