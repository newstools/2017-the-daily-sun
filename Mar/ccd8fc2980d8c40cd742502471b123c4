NEWLY appointed Bloemfontein Celtic coach, Luc Eymael, says he won&rsquo;t achieve his objective of helping the side avoid relegation without commitment from players.Eymael joined the struggling side on a two-and-half-year deal on Friday after his resignation as Polokwane City coach.&nbsp;Celtic have been without a coach since Serame Letsoaka&rsquo;s departure in last October, following a string of poor results.Realising that Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka were struggling to ignite the club on a caretaker basis, management moved swiftly to bring Eymael on board.Eymael dropped a bombshell on City after he guided them to the last 16 round of the Nedbank Cup on Tuesday, following a 3-0 hammering of ABC Motsepe League minnows, African All Stars.He helped City surpass management&rsquo;s expectations to occupy 7th spot on the Premiership table.Said Eymael: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big challenge and a risk to take on a team at the bottom. I know how to use players on the pitch.I also know the league and each player. But you don&rsquo;t get results without hard work, commitment and being responsive to the system.&rdquo;Added Eymael: &ldquo;What can a coach do with players who refuse to remain humble? I&rsquo;ll give them all the tools to add value to the team. They also need to strive for success.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eymael told SunSport he turned down lucrative offers from the continent and Europe in favour of the PSL, for the love of the country.He went on: &ldquo;I could have joined other clubs outside South Africa because football is the same all over the globe, but the mentality is different. &ldquo;I got good offers from Tunisia and other overseas clubs. But I turned them down because I wanted to continue working here.&rdquo;Eymael will be at the helm for the first time when his charges tackle title challengers, Cape Town City, in a league game to be played at Dr Molemela Stadium on Saturday (6pm).
