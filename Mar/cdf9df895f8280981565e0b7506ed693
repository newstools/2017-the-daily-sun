SAFA President, Dr Danny Jordaan has described the late liberation struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada as a selfless cadre who was kind to people from all walks of life and was a very measured human being.Kathrada who remained politically active until his dying days, passed away in the early hours of Tuesday and President Jacob Zuma has requested the national flag to fly at half mast in honour of the struggle hero.He was 87.&ldquo;The giant has passed away, Ahmed Kathrada was a great man, humble and very measured in whatever he did,&rdquo; said Dr Jordaan, a former ANC legislator as the dawn of the new dispensation.&ldquo;He was a hard worker, honesty and I remember him spending time with the late Father of the Nation, Nelson Mandela during his last days.&ldquo;He is the last of the generation, together with Andrew Mlangeni and Dennis Goldberg that fought for the liberation of the country. The three were the last surviving members of the Rivonia trial,&rdquo; added Dr Jordaan.Mlangeni and Goldberg are now the only surviving duo of the Rivonia Trial which took place between 1963 and 1964 and which led to the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela.The SAFA President recalled an intensive Robben Island tour Kathrada took with the SAFA Congress members in 2015 in Cape Town.&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t take a bus on that extensive tour but walked and explained in detail how life was at the famous Island. We are shattered by his death but Kathrada will be remembered for his role in creating a new and vibrant South Africa. May his soul rest in peace,&rdquo; concluded Dr Jordaan.
