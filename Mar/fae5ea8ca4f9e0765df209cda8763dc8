TSHEPO Mashaba trusted his traditional healer and went to him whenever he had problems. But today he claimed he is R105 000 poorer because he made the mistake of believing the healer, who said he could perform the impossible task of turning his money into R2 million before disappearing with the cash! The 37-year-old from Palm Springs in Ekurhuleni saidthe healer had told him that, in order to increase his money, he needed to buy a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; bag worth R25 000. When he told the man he couldn&rsquo;t afford it, the healer said he should sell his house as he would be able to buy a nicer one when he got his millions. &ldquo;I sold my three-roomed house and bought the bag. I had R80 000 left, which he told me he would bless. &ldquo;After he had blessed it, he left the money in a huge safe at my house and told me it would multiply in there.&ldquo;I left it for a month, but then I started worrying and opened it. &ldquo;I found only newspapers and two bricks inside.&rdquo; Tshepo, in a state of panic, said he went to the healer&rsquo;s place of business but he had disappeared. &ldquo;When I tried to open a case at the police station the officers told me I had handed over the money willingly and they couldn&rsquo;t do anything. &ldquo;I am now facing huge problems as I can&rsquo;t even afford to pay rent for the place I&rsquo;m living at now. &ldquo;I phoned the healer and he said he was out of the country and would return my money when he came back.&rdquo; When the SunTeam tried to call the healer, his phone was off. Sangoma Dabulamanzi said people must not be deceived by get-rich-quick scams. She said muthi cannot make a person rich. &ldquo;People must just work hard and save,&rdquo; she said.
