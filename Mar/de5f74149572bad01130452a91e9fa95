I guess she doesn&rsquo;t need us there.

Today will be an intimate affair for Ayanda, the family and S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; said Thobile.She said Ayanda&rsquo;s mourning wasn&rsquo;t about culture but she was merely respecting her husband.&ldquo;Ayanda decided by herself how she&rsquo;d mourn her husband. Now she&rsquo;s decided to do the cleansing ceremony todayon Sunday and take off her mourning clothes. After this, she can carry on with her life and also be able to attend to the media and the general public,&rdquo; said Thobile.Thobile added that she didn&rsquo;t know S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s mum wasn&rsquo;t invited.She said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re also having a ceremony on the same date.&rdquo;South African Traditional Healers Association President, Sazi Mhlongo, said tradition dictates that Sfiso&rsquo;s family should perform the ceremony for Ayanda.&ldquo;If she does it on her own, she invites bad luck and will need to slaughter a goat to apologise,&rdquo; said Mhlongo.
