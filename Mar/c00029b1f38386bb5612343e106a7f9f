FOR many people, having triplets is a blessing from above. However, for Busi Yende (30) from Kempton Park, in Ekurhuleni, it&rsquo;s been a curse. Busi told Daily Sun when she first received the news that she was carrying triplets, she was shocked and scared. All she could think of was how she would manage to take care of her babies. She gave birth to three healthy baby girls on 14 December, but she said instead of bringing her happiness, they brought misery. &ldquo;I cannot take care of the babies. I&rsquo;m a single parent and I am unemployed. When I had the triplets I already had another child I was struggling to support,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My boyfriend said I should keep the babies and that we would figure something out but he was nowhere to be found when the babies were born. Things are very tough for me and I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo; Busi said she had considered giving the babies away. &ldquo;One pack of nappies costs R170. I also have to buy milk and clothes and pay for medicine. I&rsquo;m begging for help from the People&rsquo;s Paper,&rdquo; she said. Gauteng Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said her situation saddened him. &ldquo;As a department we always strive to serve our people and put their needs first. &ldquo;A team of professionals will visit the mother and assist her with groceries and clothes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Social workers will also help her apply for social grants with Sassa. &ldquo;The department will assist the children with medical care and ensure they are taken care of.&rdquo;
