THE ONCE mighty Moroka Swallows could be liquidated should they miss their Fifa deadline to settle all debts this year.SunSport has reliably learnt that as many as three players have lodged complaints with the SA Football Association (Safa) after their salaries were not paid. The national football controlling body escalated the matter to Fifa.It is believed that Fifa sent an instruction to dissolve the team but the current &ldquo;unofficial administrators&rdquo; of the club, including Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi, asked for more time to settle their debts.This comes as Swallows face an all-important Gauteng ABC Motsepe League clash against title-chasing Orange Vaal Professionals at the Qedilizwe Stadium on Saturday (3pm).This is their last league match of the season and defeat or a draw will see them relegated to the lower SAB League.Lesufi confirmed to SunSport that Fifa was ready to liquidate the club, as there are a further eight outstanding cases that need to be settled with companies seeking payment from Swallows.&ldquo;All this has resulted in the club&rsquo;s bank accounts being closed,&rdquo; he explained.&ldquo;I am doing this for the love of the club. I understand that three former players are owed more than R280 000 each. Even the stadium (Dobsonville Stadium) is owed money.&rdquo;Lesufi, who was due to meet with the players yesterday to offer them financial incentives to win Saturday&rsquo;s match, has asked Safa to review the Motsepe League, alleging that corruption is the order of the day.He said: &ldquo;Swallows are about to be relegated but the good thing is that we played all our matches fairly and have not even thought about cheating. But other teams are doing just that, week in and week out. &ldquo;We have been approached many times but we refuse to be dragged into such corrupt acts.&rdquo;
