THERE was no final viewing of Thabiso Monate&rsquo;s body when he was laid to rest on Saturday. This is because his body had not only been dismembered, but was in a terrible state after more than 10 cars and several trucks drove over it. Parts of his body, his teeth and brains, were only recovered after he was laid to rest.Cops are investigating an inquest docket, after more than one vehicle ran over Thabiso (31), on the road outside Leslie, near Secunda in Mpumalanga, on 21 February. The first car to run over him was allegedly a grey Tata. Thabiso&rsquo;s mother Susan Monate (53) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We heard about the person who had been run over by many cars but it never occurred to us that it could be Thabiso. We only discovered it was him last Saturday when cops arrived to give us the bad news.&rdquo;Susan said she only managed to identify him by his clothes and cellphone that were recovered at the scene. &ldquo;The last motorist to drive over Thabiso stopped to check what had caused the bump on the road. He immediately diverted cars and trucks away from his body but it was too late. Thabiso was shredded to tiny little pieces. We literally buried minced meat.&rdquo;Thabiso&rsquo;s uncle Daniel Monate said they were told by at least two people that the car that first ran over him had stopped. &ldquo;The driver allegedly dragged his body back into the road and ripped off the licence disc from his shattered windscreen before he fled. &ldquo;He left his bumper and car registration plate at the scene. &ldquo;He wanted to make this another unsuspecting motorist&rsquo;s problem.&rdquo;Warrant Officer Khuselwa Matroos said a shattered windscreen without a licence disc was found on the scene. She said detectives established that more than one vehicle drove over the body.
