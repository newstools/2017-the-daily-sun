SUPERSPORT United&rsquo;s Thuso Phala is hoping luck will be on their side when they face Al-Ahly Shendi in the first round of the Caf Confederation Cup in Sudan. SuperSport leave for Sunday&rsquo;s first leg match at Shendi Stadium in Shendi today. Their fellow-Confed Cup competitors Platinum Stars have a date with Uganda&rsquo;s Vipers at the St Mary&rsquo;s Stadium in Kampala tomorrow.Phala said the experience gained in continental tournaments was vital for the team&rsquo;s success in all competitions. He said they wanted to go as far as they could in Africa and that an away goal would make things slightly easier when they host Shendi in the return leg next weekend. Said Phala: &ldquo;We hope to get an away goal and a good result, knowing it will give us an advantage at home. It will always be tough playing in Africa but it&rsquo;s also a good experience for guys who haven&rsquo;t played there before, like Jeremy Brockie and Michael Boxall.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to play away first to get the feel of the team and know what to expect when you come back home. Then you can plan better.&rdquo;Matsatsantsa a Pitori will be kept busy by their hectic schedule, taking part in three competitions at the same time. They also face National First Division&rsquo;s Royal Eagles in a Nedbank Cup match at Harry Gwala Stadium next Wednesday. &ldquo;It interrupts our league programme &ndash; we might as well push all the way through and see how far we get. It becomes an advantage that we don&rsquo;t have a lot of days in between the games, breaks become a disruption. &ldquo;We have a big squad, the games in Africa allow guys who don&rsquo;t get regular game-time in the league to get a run,&rdquo; he said.
