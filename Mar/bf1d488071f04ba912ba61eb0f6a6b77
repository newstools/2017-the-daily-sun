A C-130 MILITARY cargo plane is no small aircraft. It carries both military equipment and personnel.Steering it calls for a cool head and steady hand. And this is where Nandi Zama (31), Mzansi&rsquo;s first black woman to command such a monster plane, feels right at home!Nandi, who touched down at Waterkloof Airforce Base on Friday as the first black C-130 woman commander, told Daily Sun she joined the military straight after finishing high school in 2003.Through hard work she now has made history. As a commander, Nandi is responsible for the safe arrival of the aircraft and crew whenever her C-130 takes to the skies.SANDF spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Ntsikelelo Mantshongo said they were very proud of her. He said when a mission is planned, Nandi has to bring together a specialist team while making sure she doesn&rsquo;t exceed the maximum weight.Nandi went through military training before joining the central flying school in 2006. &ldquo;I got my wings in December 2006 and in 2007 I was transferred to 41 squadron.&rdquo; She then flew the Cessna Caravan and the Casa 212. At 28 squadron&sbquo; she now commands the C-130 four-engine plane. She had already been flying it for four years before taking command of the plane.
