NEWLY APPOINTED Joburg city manager Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni could be facing a jail term of up to a year. This is because he failed to appear before the Commission for the Protection of Cultural Rights yesterday. Commission chairwoman Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: &ldquo;He has committed an offence and we are left with no option but to charge him. We will ask Hillbrow police to help us charge him. He faces a fine and imprisonment of about a year.&rdquo; The manager&rsquo;s representative, Peter Manganye, admitted to the chairwoman he was aware the summons stated clearly that it was not transferable to another member of staff. The commission had been conducting hearings since Monday into the deaths of young people at initiation schools. Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said Joburg had no by-laws to protect children. While addressing Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza, Mkhwanazi-Xaluva said: &ldquo;We remain hopeless and helpless. &ldquo;Children are beaten at these initiation schools that are run by criminals. &ldquo;Some are beaten just because they don&rsquo;t understand a song. Some are tortured until they need skin grafts. &ldquo;Children as young as 14 are forcefully taken out of school and come back as gangsters and nyaope addicts.&rdquo; Mayathula-Khoza admitted her department needed to do something about the problem. She said: &ldquo;Allow me to take the matter to cabinet.&rdquo;
