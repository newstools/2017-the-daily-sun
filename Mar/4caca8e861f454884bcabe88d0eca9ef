A GROUP of women from Dube Hostel in Soweto nearly shut the local cop shop down on Tuesday afternoon. The women protested at the gate of Meadowlands Police Station and did not let anyone in or out. The protesters said they were angry over the murder of Esther Gwala (53), who went missing on Saturday afternoon and was found dead on Monday morning. She had been raped before being stabbed several times. Esther&rsquo;s body was dumped in a hole next to the Dube Train Station. Zimbili Mkhonza (43) said: &ldquo;She was killed like a goat. She had 15 stab wounds.&rdquo; Esther&rsquo;s sister Thandiwe Dlomo (37) said: &ldquo;We reported to the cops when she went missing, but they did nothing.&rdquo; She said residents searched for Esther on Sunday, with no success. They eventually found her the next morning. Thandiwe said they contacted the cops after the body was found, but they arrived hours later. &ldquo;We were there from about 7am, but the cops only came at 2pm,&rdquo; she said. She said she hoped whoever killed her sister &ldquo;rots in hell&rdquo;. &ldquo;Who would do that to an old lady? My sister died a very painful death,&rdquo; she said. The protesters blocked the street outside the police station, causing heavy traffic. They only dispersed when the station commander came out to talk to them. The station commander promised to deal with the policemen if they didn&rsquo;t do their work properly. Meadowlands police spokeswoman Sergeant Octavia Thebe said a suspect was bust on Monday after he was found with bloodstains on his shoes.
