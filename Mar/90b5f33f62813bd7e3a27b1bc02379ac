Cape Town City went to the top of the table after edging out Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in a highly entertaining league encounter at the Athlone Stadium on Friday night.The first half was action packed with both teams enjoying several good scoring chances. The second half went the same way with end-to-end action and opportunities at both ends, Manyama&rsquo;s goal just before the hour mark the difference.The home team started brightly and were close to scoring in the first minute when Lehlohonolo Majoro beat Downs keeper Wayne Sandilands to a Thabo Mokeke cross, but flashed his header just wide of goal.Robyn Johannes fired wide at an eighth minute corner before Roland Putsche's venomous drive was well held by Sandilands as City continued to threaten.However, &nbsp;Sundowns were to turn things around midway through the opening stanza and put the host&rsquo;s goal under threat with a series of chances.&nbsp;But City keeper Shu-aib Walters did well to tip Percy Tau's corner over the bar and to smother Tiyani Mabunda's skidding long range effort, while Sibusiso Vilakazi sent two shots wide of the target.&nbsp;The best chance of the half though came in added time and fell to Majoro, but after arriving at the near post to meet Thamsanqa Mkhize's cross, he fired wide from close range.The Cape side were back in the ascendancy in the second half and after Sibusiso Masina had a shot blocked and Putsche went wide with a shot from the edge of the box, they took the lead when Majoro played Lebogang Manyama clean in on goal, the captain showing a cool head to hit a first-time half volley past Wayne Sandilands.A mistake from home keeper Walters two minutes later nearly cost City their lead when Anthony Laffor pulled the trigger at an empty goal, but Johannes and Tshepo Gumede combined to clear off the line.More opportunities followed for the African champions, but Soumahoro Bangaly and Leonrdo Catsro were off target with headers while Tau nearly caught out Walters at the near post.At the other end, Judas Moseamedi wasted a chance to add a second goal for City when he headed wide 12 minutes from time, while Masina arrived fractionally too late to convert a Manyama cross five minutes from time.&nbsp;The Cape team were able to hold out in the face of some late pressure to claim the three points to move above SuperSport United at the top of the standings.
