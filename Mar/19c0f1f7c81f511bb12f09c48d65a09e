FOR almost a year, different groups of thugs specialising in housebreaking and robbery allegedly terrorised Limpopo communities . . . But the long arm of the law has finally caught up with some of them! Police in Limpopo arrested more than 50 suspects last week. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, the provincial police spokesman, the last of the suspects were nabbed in the early hours of Saturday morning. &ldquo;The 52 suspects, aged between 18 and 46, were arrested for various offences ranging from armed robbery, business and residential burglary, to possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of dagga,&rdquo; Ngoepe said. Two firearms with one magazine, three motor vehicles, 11 cellphones, eight plasma TVs, three big compressors, computers and a tool box were recovered. Limpopo police also seized one blue compressor, a 5000 litre water tank, one generator, three tyres and dagga from some of the suspected thugs. &ldquo;The operation was conducted throughout the province,&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Ngoepe said. Throughout the week various police units including crime intelligence, detectives, crime prevention and the vehicle identification section were involved in the operation. &ldquo;They covered areas such as Burgersfort, Seshego, Lebowakgomo, Thohoyandou, Marble Hall, Giyani, Musina, Bela-Bela, Mahwelereng, Phalaborwa, Hlogotlou, Mankweng and Hlanganani.
