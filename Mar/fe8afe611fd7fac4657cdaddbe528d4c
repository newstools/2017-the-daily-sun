MAMELODI Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane is expecting Uganda&rsquo;s Kampala Capital City Authority FC (KCCA) to park the bus when Downs begin the defence of their Caf Champions League title at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday (7pm).Mosimane stressed it was vital not to concede and to go into the second leg of this first round encounter in the Ugandan capital next weekend with at least a two-goal lead. The coach will bring back his A team after his fringe players failed to impress when they scraped to an unconvincing 2-0 win over SAB League (fourth tier) outfit Mariveni United in the Last 32 round of the Nedbank Cup at the same venue on Monday.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve played something like six games in the past 11 days. I had to rotate players for Mariveni.&rdquo;But it would be business as usual against KCCA, he stressed.The Brazilians coach added: &ldquo;I have watched KCCA and they recently won a league match 7-0, so this certainly is not going to be a walk in the park.&rdquo;KCCA are unbeaten in their last four league matches and Mosimane knows that they will come prepared: &ldquo;Last year when we won the Champions League, we were an unknown quantity. Now everybody is aware of us and will be prepared for us.&ldquo;It is vital we don&rsquo;t concede at home against the Ugandans. And we must go there with at least a 2-0 win from the first leg. They have a compact pitch and will come at us in the second leg. &ldquo;Our job will be more difficult if we concede at home. We&rsquo;ve learnt from last season in the Champions League how important away goals are and how important it is to keep a clean sheet at home.&rdquo;Mosimane is happy his Colombian striker Leo Castro scored against Mariveni: &ldquo;Leo has been trying hard to break the ice this year and I&rsquo;m happy he scored. It will help him get his confidence back.&rdquo;The Downs coach will still be without injured striker Khama Billiat and Ugandan international goalkeeper Denis Onyango.
