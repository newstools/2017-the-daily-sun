LEBO Majoko is safe today and it&rsquo;s all thanks to her dog China.&nbsp; One-year-old China nearly lost his leg when he took a bullet to protect Lebo and her family from armed thugs on Sunday.&nbsp; Lebo said she was asleep when she heard noises outside her house in Ga-Rankuwa extension 13, Tshwane.&nbsp; At first she thought it was just people having fun on the street, but she started worrying when China didn&rsquo;t stop barking.&nbsp; She looked through the window and got the shock of her life. Three armed men were playing with China!&nbsp; &ldquo;I woke up my husband and he started swearing at the thugs, hoping it would chase them away. We both feared for our lives,&rdquo; said Lebo.&nbsp; She managed to open her bathroom window while the thugs tried to break down the front door. She called for help and soon residents were on their way.&nbsp; Lebo said when the men saw they were about to be caught, they pointed a gun at China. She watched helplessly as her brave dog was shot by the thugs.&nbsp; Lebo said thinking about the incident still traumatised her, as she believed the thugs would have shot her family if they had managed to get into the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought my dog would be that brave. I thank my ancestors for using China to come to our rescue.&rdquo;&nbsp; China was taken to a nearby veterinary clinic by the SPCA, and his wound was treated.&nbsp; Ga-Rankuwa police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said that a case of attempted house robbery has been opened. He said cops were investigating, but no arrest has been made.&nbsp;
