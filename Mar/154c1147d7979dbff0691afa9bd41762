THE TWO girls are only five and ten years old but they are lucky to be alive. They were allegedly poisoned, kidnapped and thrown from a moving car. NOW THEY ARE SAFELY BACK WITH THEIR FATHER.The children&rsquo;s stepmum (31) is in police custody facing charges of kidnapping and child abuse.&nbsp; The 36-year-old father from Mfundo Park Section, Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, Gauteng said when he married the woman in November last year, she promised she would look after his children from a previous relationship.&nbsp; But on Wednesday, the new wife allegedly poisoned the two children, took the 10-year-old girl and threw her out of a moving car in Germiston, and then threw the five-year-old girl out of a moving car in Zonke Zizwe.&nbsp; &ldquo;My older daughter was found by the community patrollers who called the Germiston police. They took her to Vosloorus Police Station.&nbsp; &ldquo;The younger girl was thrown out in Zonke Zizwe, near the railway line and was found by a pedestrian in the area.&nbsp; &ldquo;I found my children at the police station. I was with my wife, who said she didn&rsquo;t know where the children were.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the father separated from his first wife in 2012, the kids have been staying at his mother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The first time the family thought there might be a problem was when the kids&rsquo; uncle came running to the father&rsquo;s house, telling him the children were gone.&nbsp; The uncle said when he arrived at the house on Wednesday, the gate was locked. When the gogo arrived home, she unlocked the gate and went inside,but the kids were nowhere to be found.&nbsp; The father phoned his wife. She said she didn&rsquo;t know where the kids were, although neighbours said they had seen her drive the kids away in the father&rsquo;s car.&nbsp; The wife came home and the two went to the police station.&nbsp; &ldquo;While we were together at the police station, police from Germiston arrived with my first born daughter,&rdquo; said the father.&nbsp; &ldquo;As she was telling me what happened, cops from Spruit arrived with my second daughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he fainted and had to be revived when he saw what his children looked like, covered in grass, tired and scared.&nbsp; Then his wife allegedly confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;She told the police she had poisoned the kids and thrown them into the bush because they were getting too much love and attention from me.&nbsp; &ldquo;My wife was always quiet and down to earth. She was so loving and I loved her very much. But now I don&rsquo;t want to see her. She must rot in jail.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children were taken to a doctor who said the liquid found in a bottle in the car may have contained poison.&nbsp; He treated them and sent them home with their father.&nbsp; Vosloorus police spokesman Captain Piet Rossouw confirmed that police are investigating cases of kidnapping and child abuse. Rossouw said there was not enough evidence to indicate the children had been poisoned and attempted murder was not added to the charges.&nbsp; The stepmother was arrested and will appear in the Vosloorus Magistrates Court today.&nbsp;
