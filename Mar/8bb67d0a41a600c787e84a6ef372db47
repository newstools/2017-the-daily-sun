If we hear the school was burnt down, we will never build another one for you.&rdquo;Boitshepo Mosala (48), a parent, said the school will change the lives of their children. &ldquo;Our children will be on the same level as the kids who study in the suburbs. &ldquo;I am grateful to the government for trying to improve our kids&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;
