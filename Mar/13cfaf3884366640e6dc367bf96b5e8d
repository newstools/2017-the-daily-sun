THE department of health has been told to learn from South African Breweries how to deliver . . .

They should see how efficiently SAB delivers,” David said residents had for years been complaining about shortage of staff at their clinic, but government offered no solution.“Pensioners, chronic patients and children join the queue from as early as 5am,” said David. “There is no shelter and they have to wait in the cold for the clinic to open at 8am.” He said frustrated patients often gave up hope and left the facility without getting help.Eastern Cape health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said communities had a right to raise their concerns over services, and the department would address their grievances.He urged residents to stop closing down facilities and to rather approach the department for a solution.“Closing down a clinic infringes on the constitutional rights of other patients.”
