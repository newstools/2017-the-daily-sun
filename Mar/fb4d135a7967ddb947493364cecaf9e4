WITNESSES said the noise from the collapsing roof sounded like the entire hospital was falling in on them. Late yesterday afternoon, sniffer dogs were being used to search for two people believed to be trapped under the rubble after the roof at the entrance to Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Joburg collapsed earlier. The incident happened while private construction workers were filling a leaking section of the roof. Mpho Tlou said he suddenly heard a big bang and saw a cloud of dust. &ldquo;I was on my way to the pharmacy when it happened. I&rsquo;m still in shock.&rdquo; Gauteng Health Department emergency medical services head Arnold Malotana confirmed the collapse. Joburg Emergency Management Services&rsquo; Nana Radebe said two people were trapped under the rubble and workers had to remove it to rescue them. The DA&rsquo;s Jack Bloom said he had warned that the hospital&rsquo;s structure was deteriorating and that it needed quick repairs. In October, he sent out a press release about these issues, including water leaks in the pediatric clinic and about surgery that had to be stopped in one of the theatres last year because of leaks. The health department confirmed that two construction workers, two members of the public and one hospital staff member were injured. MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said: &ldquo;We assure people we share their concerns in terms of patient safety, while confirming the incident was confined to the main entrance of the hospital, so patients were not affected.&rdquo;
