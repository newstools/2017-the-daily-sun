A SANGOMA (54) was arrested for possession of dagga in Klipgat, North West on Friday.This happened during an operation by the Klipgat visible policing and K9 units at Lekgema Village.Cops received a tip-off about drugs in Klipgat.They discovered 32 bags of dagga in the house of the sangoma, who is popular in the area.The dagga weighed about 423kg, with an estimated value of R100 000.One of the residents, Samkelo Ndlovu, said he believed the dagga was used to perform rituals in some cultures.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with a sangoma having dagga because it can be used to heal some illnesses.&rdquo; But another resident who said she was the sangoma&rsquo;s client said she was shocked by the extent of the dagga.&ldquo;I am worried about why she had so many bags of dagga,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Now I wonder if she was using the dagga in the right way or selling it to make extra cash.&rdquo; She said she believed the sangoma perhaps took advantage of her calling and sold the dagga to residents in the area.North West police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said that the owner of a house in Klipgat was arrested for possession of dagga.&ldquo;The suspect is expected to appear in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo;She said the arrest would send drug dealers a message that they had no place in &shy;society.
