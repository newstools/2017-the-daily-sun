AMAJITA have qualified for the Fifa Under-20 World Cup! South Africa finished second in Group B of the Caf Africa Youth Cup of Nations behind Senegal after their 3-1 victory over Sudan at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka, Zambia, yesterday. Phakamani Mahlambi, Grant Margeman and Sibongakonke Mbatha all found the back of the net for Mzansi&rsquo;s Under-20s, while Khaled Osman scored a consolation goal for Sudan. South Africa, Zambia, Guinea and Senegal will represent the continent at the global tournament. Coach Thabo Senong has redeemed himself by ensuring Amajita qualify for the country&rsquo;s third Under-20 World Cup, after they bombed out of the group stages at the 2015 edition of the continental event. Senong&rsquo;s charges now face hosts Zambia in the semifinal on Wednesday, with Senegal up against Guinea. Amajita&rsquo;s defence was disappointing in the first half, with players often getting their wires crossed and leaving the Sudan attack unmarked. The Sudanese goal was the result of bad marking by Amajita on the right. As the opposition team had almost scored a similar goal in the first half, South Africa did obviously not learn from their earlier mistake, handing Sudan the goal. Senong&rsquo;s charges came back in the second half looking better and creating more goal-scoring chances, ultimately finding the back of the net two more times. Platinum Stars&rsquo; Kobamelo Kodisang made an impact when he came on for Mahlambi in the second half and handed Mbatha an assist for Amajita&rsquo;s third goal. Luther Singh was a thorn in the side of the Sudan defence but they put him on lockdown, tracking and blocking his every attempt at goal and denying him a chance to add to his tally at the tournament.
