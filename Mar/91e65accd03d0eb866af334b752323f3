BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic coach Lehlohonolo Seema has issued a heartfelt apology to supporters for his team&rsquo;s below-par performance in the Absa Premiership. Siwelele&rsquo;s poor run continued when they crashed to a 3-0 defeat to Platinum Stars at the Dr Molemela Stadium at the weekend. Siwelele fans, unable to stomach the heavy loss to Dikwena, made their anger known by invading the pitch. Seema condemned fans&rsquo; behaviour in the strongest possible terms and insists violence is not the answer to their problems. But while he was apologetic regarding the manner in which his team dropped the three points, he pleaded with fans to be patient after their dismal showing against Stars. However, the Free State outfit won&rsquo;t have it any easier when they visit title contenders Bidvest Wits at Milpark Stadium tomorrow (8pm). Seema said he still had the backing of management, players and his technical team: &ldquo;It was sad to see kids and women getting scared and running all over the pitch, and police having to get involved to disperse supporters in the aftermath of our defeat. We don&rsquo;t want fans to only support the team when we&rsquo;re winning.&rdquo; Celtic are flirting with relegation in 13th place in the log table with 18 points from 18 games. They are just five points above bottom-of-the-table Baroka FC. They couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a tougher hurdle than their next game against championship hopefuls Wits, although the Students lost 2-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns in their last outing.Seema said: &ldquo;Wits are fighting for the league, we are fighting for survival. It will be a tough game, but we&rsquo;ll fight for every point. We can beat Wits.&rdquo;
