They have improved by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;"It doesn't mean we are out of the relegation zone as yet but we have put ourselves in the better situation."The Lions of the North moved to 13th place in the league table after beating Maritzburg United 1-0 at Makhulong Stadium on Sunday.

The former SuperSport United and Bafana Bafana mentor also welcomed the international break as he believes the players needed some break to rejuvenate.&nbsp;Added Igesund: "it is always difficult when you win and the international break comes because you want to continue playing.

Now I think the players deserve a little bit of a break. I think it will do us good."
