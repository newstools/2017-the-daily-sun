I made a quick U-turn and took a longer route. I didn&rsquo;t want to drive a stinking car. I&rsquo;m an insurance consultant and image is everything.&rdquo;Nomsa Siparara (53) added: &ldquo;This is unhealthy. As pedestrians we are splashed with kak by speeding cars. Kak brings bad luck! We cannot live like this.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We have put a a programme to replace sewage pipes with bigger ones across KwaZakhele. &ldquo;However, we are only focusing on water pipes at the moment.
