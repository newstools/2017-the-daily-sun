THE happy winners of the Daily Sun Win a Sheep Competition collected their prizes over the weekend. Raymond Mdhluli, Daily Sun&rsquo;s supply chain client manager, said it was a great experience to meet SunReaders who came to Lenasia in southern Joburg to claim their sheep. &ldquo;Some of our loyal readers have won other competitions. &ldquo;Others are first-time winners, as more and more people join the Daily Sun family.&rdquo; He said the competition entries were overwhelming and the People&rsquo;s Paper will do it again. &ldquo;It could be you taking home a sheep, grocery vouchers, or a Daily Sun T-shirt and a cap before the end of the month,&rdquo; he said. Winner Philemon Mukhabele (59) from Mamelodi, east of Pretoria, said he couldn&rsquo;t believe it when he was called to collect his sheep. &ldquo;I will have a big braai and invite friends and family to celebrate with me.&rdquo; Tshidi Moloto (43) from Alexandra, Joburg said she won&rsquo;t have to buy meat for weeks. Winner Manuel Manhare said he loves the passion of the people who put the paper together. &ldquo;The reporters are always on the ground covering stories that affect our lives.&rdquo; The SPCA monitored the process so that animals were slaughtered or transported in the right way. Alfred Dlamini from the Joburg SPCA said: &ldquo;Some people wanted to take the live sheep home. &ldquo;We told them how to transport the animals correctly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
