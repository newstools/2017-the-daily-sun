Captain Tercious Malepe is also expected to start in the second game. He was suspended for the opening match after receiving two yellow cards in the qualifiers. A win for Thabo Senong&rsquo;s charges tomorrow will virtually assure them a place in the semifinals. The teams that finish at the top of the two groups will go through to the semifinals and secure a spot at the Under-20 World Cup. Despite the impressive start Senong says they are not getting carried away. He refuses to entertain talk of winning the trophy and qualifying for the World Cup. He said: &ldquo;We won against a good team but we are not going to talk about winning the tournament or qualifying for the World Cup at the moment. Our main focus is to take it one game at the time.&rdquo;Senong is quite confident that his charges won&rsquo;t disappoint in their next game and will go all out to beat Young Lions of Teranga. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t experience any problems with regard to the players&rsquo; performance in the next match &ndash; they will work hard.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to coach these 18 and 19-year-old players but it&rsquo;s possible. If you give them feedback it always helps them. &ldquo;We are here to develop them, this is a development tournament,&rdquo; said Senong.
