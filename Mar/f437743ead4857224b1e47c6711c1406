BIRDS of a feather flock together!&nbsp; This is definitely true for the Facebook group called Single Parents Dating Ones, which is where single parents look for love.&nbsp; Bonginkosi Nkosi (40) and Noxolo Mthiya (36) from Mofolo South in Soweto told Daily Sun they met through the page and have been together for five years.&nbsp; Bongikosi said he struggled to find the right woman after he broke up with the mum of his children seven years ago. &ldquo;In 2012, I joined the group and met Noxolo. &ldquo;We soon fell in love,&rdquo; said the father, who has since had a third child with Noxolo.&nbsp; He said he posted his photo and details on the page and was soon chatting to beautiful women. &ldquo;I could choose between a number of women but went with Noxolo because we had a lot in common.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the SunTeam visited the Facebook page, many people were looking for love.&nbsp; Brian Legoabe wrote: &ldquo;Hi, single ladies. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m available for a serious relationship. Only women under 32 who live in Pretoria.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon women responded and when the SunTeam called him, he said he had found love. But not everyone is impressed with the page. Gogo Mancube Sithole (69) from Meadowlands, Soweto said it was wrong. &ldquo;What is happening these days shows the world is really ending.&rdquo;
