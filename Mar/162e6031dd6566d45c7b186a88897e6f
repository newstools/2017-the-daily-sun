WHEN the municipal truck parked outside Pumla Sheik&rsquo;s house on Wednesday her family were happy. They thought they would finally be free of the smell of kak that has been making their lives hell since 2013. But their joy didn&rsquo;t last long, as the truck pulled away but the smell remained! Pumla (54) told Daily Sun she thought their prayers had been answered and she was excited that the smell would finally be tackled. She even thanked the SunTeam, which had notified the municipality about the river of kak near her house and that of her neighbour. Pumla and the neighbour, Mbuyiselo Vena (41) from Wells Estate in Port Elizabeth, have been living with dams of sewage near their yards since 2013.She said all efforts to have the pipe fixed by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality were fruitless. &ldquo;Everybody in the house was excited when municipal workers arrived. &ldquo;The workers arrived for the first time on Tuesday and did some observations.&ldquo;They came back again on Wednesday. &ldquo;But instead of fixing it, they told us the problem lies with the main sewer pipeline and left.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;I am not sure when exactly, but the municipal workers will go back and deal with the problem.&rdquo;
