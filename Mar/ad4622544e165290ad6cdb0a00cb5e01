FRANCE Ntimba promised rural village kids a swimming pool. He dug and dug and dug . . . Today, 17 years later, there is still no swimming pool. The villagers have placed huge rocks on the hole he dug, and this has killed his dream. The 47-year-old from Joe Slovo in Mpumalanga is not only angry, but he is also feeling betrayed by his village. &ldquo;I wanted to make them proud to be the first village in this area to have their own swimming pool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they have now turned against me. At first they were with me and encouraged me to keep digging and build the pool. It is not my fault that it took longer than it should have. I am the only one working on this pool.&rdquo; France said people in his village say he is a white man in a black skin. He said the betrayal got so bad that last year he was called to a community meeting, where he was ordered to cover the hole. But he refused. &ldquo;Their excuse was that they would not be able to fill it, as the village does not have water. No one thought of this when I began digging years ago.&rdquo; Village headman Zankewu Sithole (45) said a swimming pool for the village would be cool, considering the blistering heat in the area. &ldquo;The sad part is that we live in a water-scarce area. This sort of thing is only for white people, not us,&rdquo; he said.
