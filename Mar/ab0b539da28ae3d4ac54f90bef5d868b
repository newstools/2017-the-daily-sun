MOURNERS expecting to see a widow covered in a blanket at the funeral of Sibusiso Sithole on Saturday were left shocked. Instead of following tradition, his wife S&rsquo;lindile danced when her husband&rsquo;s favourite song was played! Sibusiso (39), the municipal manager of Richmond in the KZN Midlands, was gunned down last week. When Sibusiso&rsquo;s favourite song, Mama Ka Sibongile by the Soul Brothers, was played S&rsquo;lindile stood up, clapped her hands and moved a little, a big smile on her face. The song was played after she read a letter to her late husband. In the letter she wrote that she was hurt by her partner&rsquo;s murder but would forgive his killers because that was what he would have done. But a 45-year-old mourner said: &ldquo;When a woman is mourning the death of her husband, she should not dance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if she&rsquo;s happy that her husband is dead.&rdquo;Another mourner (38) said S&rsquo;lindile had done what would have made her husband happy.About 5 000 mourners, including government officials, filled a tent at Richmond Primary School to pay their last respects. Sibusiso&rsquo;s brother Mpumelelo (49) said: &ldquo;My brother was a hard-working man who didn&rsquo;t deserve to be killed in such a terrible way.&rdquo;Speaking at the funeral, Minister Nathi Nhleko assured the family that police would find the culprits.
