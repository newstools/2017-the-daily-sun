DIMAKATSO Monedi was heartbroken after her son was murdered, allegedly by a friend. And to make her suffering worse, the 66-year-old believes justice has not been served because his alleged killer walks free.Dimakatso&rsquo;s son Mohau (29) was shot and killed two years ago inside his rented room in Braamfischerville, Soweto.&ldquo;No rituals were performed and my son&rsquo;s spirit was not taken home,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I have travelled from Lesotho to collect my son&rsquo;s spirit.&ldquo;The ancestors are angry and I will not have any peace until my son&rsquo;s spirit is taken home, and he keeps visiting me in my dreams.&ldquo;He tells me he won&rsquo;t rest until he is buried at home.&rdquo; The ritual has to be performed where Mohau was killed, but the family that owns the property won&rsquo;t grant them access.House owner Pastor Lefuno Mokoena said: &ldquo;We are Christians. I can&rsquo;t allow someone to come and perform rituals in my home.&rdquo;Joburg Central police spokesman Warrant Officer Gordon Billings told Daily Sun that the suspect was tried and acquitted.&ldquo;If Dimakatso is unhappy, the best option for her is to take the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal,&rdquo; Billings said.
