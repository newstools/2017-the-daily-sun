SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has failed
in her constitutional duty in respect of social grants and the 17 million
beneficiaries, the Constitutional Court heard today.Advocate Geoff Budlender, SC, representing Black Sash,
said that as it stood, no-one knew who was going to pay the beneficiaries after
31 March.He argued that Dlamini had failed to apologise and take
responsibility.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssoLvOCuKcPnrVJZbKpNc2lrqPDf9nXevrS_wfP89F35XI0kM9A_Wsu7CRmFCSnJDyh0P3G23IL1fw5x8rT4M5dCRZhqlp1zNjD-0yfKrwRxLgY4pN4PwI94ATRBG-wi1RMRAa2YogZf8zmsjfUO-EjMFTmrbCC-qdmTatSgAK9NbPhwi1VcuHuMhsxF1bKzEBxMoinwz2McRnE7FM_9iTo7qqNwuanQICCrQcBlpGITvd1jlwMmnXSi1Wco29XXEgVTekim_V2HVmj4jKBo0NPBugudFI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKC-NHP4R0L8EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

duties," Budlender told the full bench of justices.The court gallery was packed to capacity with
journalists, lawyers and supporters of Black Sash.Some elderly Sassa recipients made their way to court on
Wednesday morning to hear what the court had to say.In his submission to the court, Budlender said Dlamini
had insisted that there was no crisis, and that the media, NGOs and other
parties were making beneficiaries unsettled."The minister knew that Sassa would not be able to
pay the grants itself. She claims she was kept in the dark for six
months," Budlender argued.He said that to ensure that there was effective
oversight, they expected uninterrupted payments of grants after 31 March."If the minister says she hasn't known about this in
six months, that itself demonstrate that she cannot be relied upon."Budlender further requested the court to give directions
in the Sassa matter, as it deemed fit."We ask the court to view the contract to exercise
jurisdictions. There has been a breach of Constitution. Sassa has failed to
carry out its obligation to pay social grants."He said Dlamini had also failed to inform the court after
she found out in 2016.Meanwhile, Advocate David Unterhalter for Freedom Under
Law said there was an ongoing obligation that CPS must continue paying grant
beneficiaries.He requested the court to extend CPSâ€™s contract on the
basis that they do not profit.CPS had been enjoying the profitable benefits for five
years before its contract was deemed unlawful. It was now constitutionally
obligated to provide its service, for a limited period of no longer than 12
months, to allow Sassa to make its transition.He said that in May 2016, CPS knew that time was running
out, but failed to file any documents regarding its concerns to the court,
despite receiving no answers from their custodians.In 2014, the court ruled that the contract with CPS was
illegal and invalid. It suspended the order of invalidity until 31 March this
year to allow the department and Sassa to insource the administrative
requirements to distribute grants.This was not carried out.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dlamini-failed-beneficiaries-court-hears-20170315
