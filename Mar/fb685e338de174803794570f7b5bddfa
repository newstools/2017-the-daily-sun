YESTERDAY, Sassa started negotiations with Cash Paymaster Services to extend its contract.“This has been the most practical plan and we will engage with them,” said department of social development director-general Zane Dangor.He was addressing the Standing Committee on Public Accounts hearings into social services.He said this was to ensure that South Africans get their social grants at the end of this month.The contract is expected to end on 31 March.In 2014, the Constitutional Court declared it illegal and gave the department a deadline to send out a new tender and get a legal solution in place.But this had not been done and yesterday, committee members were shocked to learn that Sassa had withdrawn its request to the Constitutional Court for advice on the contract.The request was filed on Tuesday at about 5pm.Representatives from the Reserve Bank also attended the meeting to try and highlight possible future plans for grant payments services through banks.The issue of illegal deductions headed the meeting as MPs asked the bank to intervene.They said they felt like visitors at the committee as they always hear something new. They were frustrated by the lack of progress in Sassa’s plans and said they are losing confidence in its leadership.“While I appreciate that we have the platform to update each other, honestly we are squandering the opportunity as the contract runs out,” said DA shadow minister of social development, Bridget Masango.She described the update meetings about the readiness of Sassa as unreadiness updates.Western Cape manager Bandile Maqetuka said Sassa had been giving out grants to South Africans every month before the cash services came on board. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvzGdK64rim-3wBO8rJSnOFYyTLm2HAAVvXaaS_7sPF5ua-wTYxrhbx5iha9XSZ1v9z5jZdqOVXdXq7mNhfc25Qdmhjq03ffVBDRGSHd3pZ_MAr8rusA9D_kpj-t35BAHHuadmKO9H9ZW7Dj_Q3Dj7UEqTpN6mNbhfqCBjhXwHv0lu8A_1Wm9zCn6oFHjIhsyoammIn8zIp-UHbasC_Zgis7NfqnqtD1KJdazNl6Pp9GvVN_5Nbi2dfHqLWjvFpv0UaN1ZShBZ25iK7rTWexIBhFRwlqbs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNRv-p9lYPL4EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
