THE trapped mine workers at Lily Mine in Mpumalanga are still a burning issue for the community of Louisville near Barberton. Yesterday, Mpumalanga premier David Mabuza visited the area to talk about plans government has for the community. Mabuza told them he had secured 10 jobs for former Lily Mine employees. &ldquo;I know 10 jobs are not enough, but I will continue to talk to other mines to ensure you are appointed,&rdquo; he said. Mabuza assured the community that the trapped mineworkers would eventually be found. &ldquo;I know you are still hurting after what happened at the mine. We will do everything in our power to ensure they are found. &ldquo;However, we will also ensure we improve your lives.&rdquo;
