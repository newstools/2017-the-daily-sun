FOR two years, Robert Mdluli (43) was behind bars, awaiting trial on a charge of raping his 12-year-old stepdaughter.On Thursday he walked out of the Mhala Regional Court in Mpumalanga a free man. The magistrate found that his lover, who is blind, could not have seen him committing the alleged crime. The blind mum admitted to the court that her own mum&rsquo;s testimony could not be relied upon, as she is mentally ill.Robert&rsquo;s lover initially testified that on 21 February 2015 he demanded the money from her four kids&rsquo; disability grants at their home in Buyisonto Village.&ldquo;I refused and he threatened to rape my daughter,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I did not take him seriously, until later when I heard my seven-year-old daughter screaming that Robert was showing them his penis. He then raped my 12-year-old daughter.&rdquo;The blind mum said she told her own mother the terrible news the following day, and she called the cops to arrest Robert. &ldquo;When the rape happened, my mother was not there. Only my kids were there.&rdquo; Magistrate Elmarie Theron said the accused could not be linked to the crime. However, she upheld the protection order obtained by his lover against him.&ldquo;You must not enter her house, and if this order is violated you will be arrested,&rdquo; she said.
