WHEN Harold Mavimbela&rsquo;s brother died last year, a neighbour took advantage and built a wall that went into part of the dead man&rsquo;s yard.When the family asked him to demolish it, he refused.But now he only has a pile of rubble left!The dead neighbour got his revenge from beyond the grave when the wall collapsed on its own.Neighbours and the family of the dead man said it was obvious the dead man caused the wall to collapse.The wall in Wattville, Ekurhuleni, collapsed on Thursday night while the family was asleep.&ldquo;We just heard a rumbling sound. When we woke up, the wall had fallen down,&rdquo; said Harold.Harold said they had reported their dispute to the councillor, as the neighbour had insisted the wall was on his stand.&ldquo;Measurements were taken and it was found he had encroached on my brother&rsquo;s yard. The neighbour promised to clean the mess up this week. We will wait and see.&rdquo;Daily Sun spoke to the neighbour, Chicco Mudau, who said he would remove the rubble.He told Daily Sun he was not planning to build the wall again.The wall crushed one of the shacks in Harold&rsquo;s yard. Luckily, the tenants who were inside escaped unhurt.Harold said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy my brother got justice. If this hadn&rsquo;t happened, the man would not have removed the wall.&rdquo;
