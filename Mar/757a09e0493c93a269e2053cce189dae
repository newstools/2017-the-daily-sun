PEOPLE fear that their grants will not be paid on 1 April, when the agency is supposed to take over the payments from CashPay.Yesterday, Sassa visited a pension pay- point in Schoemansdal, Mpumalanga. The paypoint dispenses a great number of social grants monthly. It is one of 433 paypoints across the province. Social Development spokeswoman Lumka Oliphant was there and assured beneficiaries they would receive their grants on 1 April. Grant beneficiary Solomon Masilela (80), said the government needs to sort out their problems. &ldquo;As long as I get my pension grant without any problems next month, I will be happy,&rdquo; he said. Oliphant said: &ldquo;The system is working perfectly and it will not change. We are negotiating with CashPay because beneficiaries are happy with the service.&rdquo;
