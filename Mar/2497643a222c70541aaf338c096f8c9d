THIS is my passionate plea to all football brains from Ga-Mphahlele near Polokwane, in Limpopo, to urgently set up a meeting with Baroka FC chairman, Khurishi Mphahlele.Sekepe sa nwela bo ngoato (the ship is sinking). Like Nelson Mandela once said: &ldquo;If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.&rdquo; I hope this message will sink straight into their hearts.It&rsquo;s bad that Bakgaga are drowning in their first season in the elite league, while the township of their origin has a lot of experts who can help save the club.I know that my good friends and media colleagues, Matshelane Mamabolo, Mahlatse Mphahlele and Tshepang Mailwane, wouldn&rsquo;t mind forming part of the group that would advise Ntate Khurishi, who seems to be running the club down the hole.I&rsquo;d hate to see the same scenario play itself again, like what happened to my NFD club Ga-Rankuwa United, which is nowhere to be found in the professional ranks.This is because there was no advice given to the club owner on how to administer it, and now people of Ga-Rankuwa continue to rally behind other clubs that have nothing to do with their origins.Behind the smile of my colleague, Kgomotso Mokoena, there&rsquo;s a broken man after his club from Daveyton, Benoni United (The Rabbits), also disappeared into thin air after status was exchanged. Look at the people of Giyani today, they are begging David Thidiela to bring Black Leopards back to the Premiership, as they believe they belong to the PSL, and not the NFD. YOU can&rsquo;t blame them for thinking they deserve all the best, after Dynamos FC was also sold for a few rands and now they feel empty.I&rsquo;m making this passionate plea to the people of Ga-Mphahlele and those coming from in and around Limpopo because this is a big day for Premier Stanley Mathabatha&rsquo;s province.A revitalised Polokwane City, which is under comrade Johnny Mogaladi who is willing to listen to any advice, will host Baroka FC at the Peter Mokaba Stadium this afternoon (3.30pm). This is where I expect to see a full house.For all the shocking stats coming from Baroka FC, I know everyone has put the blame squarely on coach Kgoloko Thobejane and his chief executive, Morgan Mammila. I can&rsquo;t blame them as they are still learning the tricks of being in the PSL.But the help they can get from the Ga-Mphahlele kasi mates, I have mentioned earlier on, would help them a great deal.Someone needs to tell Thobejane to stop being overly excited and saying things that are bigger than him, like: &ldquo;We will win the PSL title, we will hammer Bidvest Wits 4-0 and we will win all the cups in the PSL.&rdquo;Hle sebata emisha ka ditoro khwi (Please sir, stop dreaming)!
