AFTER spending the entire day protesting in the scorching sun, some protesters felt entitled to refreshments. They headed straight to three shops allegedly owned by Somalians and started to loot them on Monday. The residents of Olievenhoutbosch, Tshwane had taken part in a protest to raise their grievances about crime, service delivery and the allocation of RDP houses. When the march ended at about 3pm, some protesters went to the shops and forcibly took what they felt like taking. They took cool drinks, mealie-meal and toiletries. The shop owners watched helplessly as the looters helped themselves to their stock. Police used rubber bullets and teargas to disperse the looters. Resident Tshepo Mokone (27) said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what these people are doing or what they want to achieve. We don&rsquo;t like what they&rsquo;ve done to the shops.&rdquo; Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said: &ldquo;I can only confirm that one shop was looted in the area. &ldquo;Two suspects were arrested for public violence.&rdquo; Makhubela said although calm was restored, police were still keeping a close eye on the area.
