ALTHOUGH it was heartbreaking losing the final of the ICC Women&rsquo;s Cricket World Cup qualifiers to India, Ayabonga Khaka believes there were many lessons learnt from that match. South Africa took silver at the qualifiers in Colombo, Sri Lanka, losing by a wicket to fourth ranked India. The Proteas still qualified for this year&rsquo;s World Cup along with India, West Indies, Pakistan, England, Australia, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. The tournament in England will run from 24 June to 23 July. The 24-year-old admits the competition will not be easy and they will have to work harder than they did in the qualifiers. Said Khaka: &ldquo;We played well at the qualifiers but we have to keep working hard because all the big teams will be at the World Cup. We learned a lot in the qualifying tournament and know what we need to work on when we go to England. Discipline will be key at the World Cup for us to have a better finish.&rdquo; She added that England had similar pitches to those in Mzansi, which should make it easier for them at the competition. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy but English conditions and pitches are much like ours here at home. Even though it will be challenging, it will be in familiar conditions that we can easily adjust to,&rdquo; she said. South Africa finished sixth at the last World Cup in 2013. The Proteas&rsquo; best result at the World Cup was in 2000 in New Zealand where they made the semifinals. Khaka said she was looking forward to her first 50 overs in the World Cup, as she has only played in two Twenty20 World Cups before. &ldquo;It will be my first long format World Cup and I am looking forward to competing there in the longer format of the game. &ldquo;It will be a test for me but I can only grow from such an experience. I have a great support system in the team and together we will do our utmost to get the best result we can,&rdquo; she said.
