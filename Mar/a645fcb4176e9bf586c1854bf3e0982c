Ajax Cape Town head coach Stanley Menzo was delighted to see his side pick up a point against SuperSport United outfit in the Premiership on Saturday.The sides are on opposite sides of the league standings with SuperSport in contention for the title, while Ajax are dangerously close to the relegation places and the gulf in class was clear from the outset of the clash.However, the Urban Warriors put in an excellent defensive display, keeping a clean sheet and earning a valuable point, but Menzo admits his side was slightly fortunate."We didn't play our best game. It was not about us but I think SuperSport didn't make us play football," he told SABC TV"They played up very high, we had to survive and defend and wait for that one moment. You saw the Man of the Match was our goalkeeper. But it was good to have a clean sheet, a point against SuperSport I think is terrific. Well, SuperSport deserves more, so we are happy with this point.""That part we are lacking and I don't know why. You can make it so easy if you communicate with the people in front of you, if you read the game and say what must happen. Especially against a good team, you have to communicate more."
