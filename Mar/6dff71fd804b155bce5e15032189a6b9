SHE wanted to look as beautiful as her sister &ndash; but things went wrong when she tried her sister&rsquo;s cream.The beauty cream made her face swell up so badly she couldn&rsquo;t even kiss her boyfriend. Cynthia Nkomo (36), from Princess squatter camp in Roodepoort, Gauteng said her sister introduced her to the cream and mixture and said it would make her look good and maintain her body weight.&ldquo;My sister used it for years and it worked for her. But when I put the cream on my face and drank the mixture after supper, my face became swollen and red. &ldquo;I cried when I looked at myself in the mirror. I saw a monster!&rdquo;The traumatised woman said for two days she could only drink liquids using a straw because her mouth was so swollen.Cynthia said she was attracted by the cream, which had a cranberry scent. &ldquo;I understand that cranberries detoxify and clean your urinary system. I really thought using it would have a good effect on my skin and body.&rdquo; Dr Zikhona Gxolo, a senior registrar in dermatology at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Pretoria, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;She might have been exposed to an allergen or irritant that resulted in her face swelling. She should take anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the swelling and pain.&rdquo;
