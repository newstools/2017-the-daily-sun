LUYANDA Patuleni (51) of KwaZakhele kasi, Port Elizabeth is dying at home because the hospital can&rsquo;t help him.He suffers from TB of the bone and his flesh is rotting. He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I have been in and out of hospital since 2004. Then in 2012 I applied for a wheelchair.&rdquo;Luyanda claims that instead of getting a wheelchair, he was shown the door. &ldquo;The nurses at Dora Nginza Hospital told me to go and die at home peacefully because there was no cure for me. They also said there was no wheelchair for me.&ldquo;I told them I could not live without my treatment. They then said I should go and get it at Empilweni TB Hospital But they never gave me a transfer card.&rdquo;His sister-in-law, Nomxolisi Patuleni (50) said: &ldquo;This is too much for Luyanda.His buttocks have wounds and he cries every day because he&rsquo;s in pain. We don&rsquo;t know how to help him. &ldquo;He needs a wheelchair so that we can take him to KwaZakhele Day Hospital, which is our nearest. &ldquo;But even there no one wants to help him.&rdquo;Eastern Cape Health Department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: &ldquo;I will refer the matter to our provincial rehabilitation manager.&rdquo;
