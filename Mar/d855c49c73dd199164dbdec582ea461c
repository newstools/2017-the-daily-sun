THE construction of the new water reservoir and pipeline brought much needed jobs to the area. But locals complained that not everyone been hired to work on the site is from the area. They were so angry they torched the bulk water pipes on site to ashes, costing the municipality more than R800 000. The residents from KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga wanted to be hired on the site in Sheldon, where the reservoir that will supply water to three villages is being built. Most say they were told they do not qualify for any jobs on site.Resident Fuzile Mabuya (37) said they were happy when the project to build the reservoir was announced. He said they were promised they would get jobs.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know who burnt the pipes. Many of us were happy to be going to get jobs but we were told that we didn&rsquo;t qualify. We are residents of this area and we are the first people who should get job opportunities here.&rdquo;Thembisile Hani Municipality spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane said: &ldquo;Such incidents delay the progress of construction to deliver water to our communities.&ldquo;It also has financial implications for the contractor and the municipality. The construction has already been delayed by five weeks due to the concerns that were raised by the concerned group or business forum.&rdquo; Mashiyane said water is the biggest challenge in areas around KwaMhlanga and the aim of the construction of the reservoir was to solve the problem for good. She said the damage will affect the infrastructure grant spending, which might lead to lack of performance by the municipality.Police spokeswoman Captain Nonhlanhla Kgosana said a malicious damage to property case had been opened.
