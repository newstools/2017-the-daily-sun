ORLANDO Pirates&rsquo; new coach, Kjell Jonevret, has the chance to capture the hearts of thousands of Buccaneers fans should his side triumph in tomorrow&rsquo;s Soweto derby. Bucs visit Kaizer Chiefs for their Absa Premiership clash at FNB Stadium tomorrow (3.30pm). Although the Happy People may be satisfied with Jonevret after their 1-1 draw with Polokwane City last week, nothing would make them happier than getting the bragging rights and collecting three points against Amakhosi. The 54-year-old Swede is determined to instil confidence in the Bucs players so they will display their best football. The ex-Djurgardens IF coach said winning the derby would give him stories to tell his grandkids some day. He said: &ldquo;Even though I haven&rsquo;t played in a Soweto derby, I have played in a lot of derbies before. I am from Stockholm and we have three big teams there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty much the same, although our arenas seat maximum 50 000. Those games are pretty special. And the winner there walks around happy for weeks while the loser runs to mama.&rdquo; Bucs captain Oupa &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; Manyisa admits they are under immense pressure to perform and turn their fortunes around. Pirates haven&rsquo;t won a match in 10 games, which had fans up in arms recently. Said Manyisa: &ldquo;It will be difficult for us to go into this match on the back of previous poor results. But the coach has prepared us well. We know what to expect from Chiefs.&rdquo; He said he hoped to return to his old self in the derby: &ldquo;Things have been hectic since my return from injury. I hope I do well and we&rsquo;re able to get that win.&rdquo;
