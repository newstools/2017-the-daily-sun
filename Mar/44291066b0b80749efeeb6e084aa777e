WHEN he woke up this morning, ANC struggle stalwart Ahmed Kathrada wanted to know what he had missed in the Sunday newspapers. The veteran is believed to be making remarkable recovery after being admitted to a Joburg hospital on Sunday for surgery relating to blood clotting on the brain, his foundation said in a statement.He was initially admitted for dehydration, but doctors later picked up the clot, which has subsequently been removed, the foundation said.Speaking shortly after visiting Kathrada this morning, the director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Balton, said: "When I saw him this morning, he was sitting on a chair with his drips still on. All he wanted to know was what were the headlines of the Sunday newspapers."Kathrada (87) read between eight to 10 newspapers every Sunday, he added."I had to go through all the Sunday papers with him. He is in good spirits and we conveyed the messages of love and prayer that we have received. He is very appreciative."Balton said doctors were happy with Kathrada's recovery."The blood clot has been sorted out now," he said.&nbsp; Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive, the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.Along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and Elias Motsoaledi, they were sentenced in 1964 to life imprisonment on Robben Island during the infamous Rivonia Trial.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kathrada-in-good-spirits-after-op-foundation-20170306
