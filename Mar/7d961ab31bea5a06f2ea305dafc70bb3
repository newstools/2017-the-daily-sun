THE cops received a tip-off about thugs who had just received guns from Mozambique and were hiding the weapons at a house in the kasi.But they allegedly stormed the wrong house and beat two Christian brothers &ndash; Bheki (31) and Alfred Qhibi (24) &ndash; while looking for the guns. It happened in Clau-Clau near Mbombela, Mpumalanga on 24 January this year. The brothers claimed that after the cops realised they had made a mistake, they apologised. They said the cops warned them not to take the matter further, as it would anger the residents. &ldquo;The cops promised to protect us. They said that the mere fact that they had stormed our home would give residents the impression that we were hiding behind religion,&rdquo; said Bheki. &ldquo;We knew they were intimidating us, so we laid charges.&rdquo;Alfred said since the incident, no action has been taken against the cops. He said the cops smashed windows and broke doors to gain entry to the house. &ldquo;We were slapped, kicked and beaten with batons.&ldquo;As they were searching for the guns, they found my passport, which showed I had been in Mozambique the previous week. They said I had gone there to get the guns.&rdquo;Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said cops had no information that the officers went to the wrong house, except the complainants&rsquo; claim against the police. Police are investigating.
