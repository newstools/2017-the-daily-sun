SYED Kaouser (39) said a traffic cop was supposed to give him a R500 fine for not buckling up.But instead, he claimed, he got a beating from the traffic cop. Syed said he was pulled over by the cop on the R568 near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga on Saturday. He said he duly gave the officer his licence, and was given a R500 fine for not wearing his seatbelt. He said his mistake was to ask to see the charge sheet, so that he would know the amount was legal.&ldquo;He refused to show me the charge sheet, so I refused to sign the ticket,&rdquo; Syed said. &ldquo;He told me to go, and as I was driving home, he followed me and ordered me to pull over. I did so. He pulled my keys out of the ignition. He wanted me to go back to the scene and take my ticket.&rdquo;Syed claimed he was yanked out of the car and had his head smashed on the bonnet of the traffic cop&rsquo;s vehicle. &ldquo;He carried on beating me with fists all over my head and face,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;People were watching in shock and begged him to stop. I was bleeding heavily, and he still forced me to take the ticket.&rdquo;According to Mpumalanga community safety, security and liaison spokesman Joseph Mabuza, the driver was aggressive and refused to take his ticket. &ldquo;He drove off and when he returned he punched the traffic cop,&rdquo; he said. Syed was charged with failing to obey directions given by a police officer, and assault. He will appear in court on Thursday.
