BARRING a few mishaps in the camp regarding Kamohelo Mokotjo&rsquo;s citizenship papers and the indecision on the new Bafana Bafana coach, there was a new-found sense of excitement with the team that defeated Guinea-Bissau 3-1 at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban yesterday.&nbsp;The rather new-look squad has won the hearts of many supporters.&nbsp;Bafana will have given the new coach, who will be unveiled after the Angola match, something to work with when he takes over the reins and hopefully he will not temper with the progress of the team.&nbsp;Bafana began life without coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba, who was relieved of his duties in December with an impressive win over the minnows.&nbsp;On Tuesday night, Bafana host Southern Africa neighbours Angola in East London in another international friendly game.&nbsp;The SA Under-23 coach Owen Da Gama was tasked with the job of leading the team against the African Wild Dogs on an interim basis.&nbsp; Da Gama named a good mixture of youth and experience in his team.&nbsp;On-form Premiership stars Lebogang Manyama, Percy Tau and Thabo Mnyamane, were also given a run.&nbsp;Kermit Erasmus marked his return to Bafana with a goal from the penalty spot before half-time.&nbsp;Substitute Tau added the second on his debut and Andile Jali grabbed the third from the penalty spot on the stroke of full-time.&nbsp;Djalo Balde scored the consolation goal for the visitors in the closing stages to deny Bafana skipper and goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune a clean sheet.&nbsp; It was the two countries&rsquo; first official meeting on the international stage and Bafana cruised to victory.&nbsp;The African Wild Dogs had a dream Africa Cup of Nations debut when they held host nation Gabon to a 1-1 draw in the tournament&rsquo;s opening game in January.&nbsp;They had qualified for the Afcon edition against all odds and they won the hearts of many football fans on the African continent. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
