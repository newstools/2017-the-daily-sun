WHENEVER Nombulelo Tsoali (42) craved her husband&rsquo;s 4-5, he&rsquo;d be quick to play the delay card with, &ldquo;Not now, my dear&rdquo;.But now she knows the reason she hasn&rsquo;t had sex with her husband since 2011.She bust her hubby, Justice Sibisi, licking fingers with his late brother&rsquo;s wife as they enjoyed some crunchy chicken at a takeaway outlet.Nombulelo, from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, said: &ldquo;I realised my husband was in love with the woman. &ldquo;Whenever I ask him to stop seeing her, he pulls out a golf club and chases me around the yard, screaming that it is accepted in his culture to be with other women.&rdquo;With their marriage on the rocks, Nombulelo claimed Justice wanted to throw her and their three children out of the house.Justice responded: &ldquo;I never said the kids must go. I said she had to go!&ldquo;Yes, I am in love with my late brother&rsquo;s wife. It&rsquo;s accepted in my culture,&rdquo; said Justice.Asked if he spoiled the woman with chicken meals, Justice said: &ldquo;Nombulelo is just jealous. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleep with her because she complains too much and I&rsquo;ve lost interest.&ldquo;I am tired of her. &ldquo;She has accused me of being with many women.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this frustration anymore.&rdquo;
