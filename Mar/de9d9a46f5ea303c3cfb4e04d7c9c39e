MEC NOMAFRENCH Mbombo opened the expanded Michael Mapongwana Health Centre in Harare, Khayelitsha yesterday. Speaking to nurses and residents, Mbombo said: &ldquo;The important thing is to improve patients&rsquo; experiences. &ldquo;The expansion was a response to the patients&rsquo; needs.&rdquo; Pastors who prayed at the event said God must protect all children born at the facility. Mbombo said residents and leaders must guard their clinic jealously because it belongs to them. &ldquo;Health is everyone&rsquo;s business. That&rsquo;s why we say people must be involved in a responsible way. &ldquo;We are responsible for the health of our people and we can&rsquo;t do it without dedicated staff.&rdquo; Mum Asavela Bunu said the expanded clinic showed many good signs. &ldquo;We used to take our young kids to a container for examinations. &ldquo;The environment wasn&rsquo;t good for us to be examined as there were no windows and the heat was unbearable,&rdquo; Asavela said. She added that the lack of privacy also made it hard for patients to discuss personal issues with nurses. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this side. &ldquo;There is enough space and we can freely interact with nurses.&rdquo; Andile Madondile from the Treatment Action Campaign said they had used protests and pickets to force the department to improve conditions. &ldquo;We are happy something has finally happened to bring dignity to these women,&rdquo; he said. Mbombo said the upgraded facility cost R7 million and they are hoping to improve more health centres in the Western Cape. She added they are also focusing on providing playgrounds for children at health facilities.
