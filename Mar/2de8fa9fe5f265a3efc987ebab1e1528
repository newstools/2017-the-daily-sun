IN JUST three years, no less than 77 people have been killed in cold blood at the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi, south of Durban.Residents claim that in all this time their ward councillor and committee had been deathly silent.Now residents are appealing to eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to disband their ward committee and recall Ward 76 Councillor, Robert Mzobe.Residents said Mzobe and his ward committee were mere scarecrows who pretended to sympathise with residents whenever their superiors addressed the matter, yet they distanced themselves from hostel residents. A hostel leader said residents regularly held meetings but Mzobe and his committee never attended them. &ldquo;Their presence means nothing to us. They were elected by us at ground level. Therefore, they need to communicate and regularly meet with us.&rdquo; He said Mzobe used to stay at the hostel, but when the killings began in 2014 he fled and found another place to live. Mthunzi Gumede, the eThekwini mayor&rsquo;s spokesman, said the Glebelands matter was sensitive and would not be discussed with the media.&ldquo;People know the proper channels they should follow if they want to complain,&rdquo; he said.He said the killings at the hostel were being dealt with by various provincial government structures.Mzobe denied allegations that he was distancing himself from the hostel residents&rsquo; meetings.&ldquo;I still stay at the hostel and my office is also there. How can I distance myself? Why am I being crucified for the issue of crime when cops are there to do their job?&rdquo; he asked.Mzobe mentioned that the newly elected ward committee was not yet operational as it had not yet been officially inaugurated.
