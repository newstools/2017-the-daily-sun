KAIZER Chiefs and Orlando Pirates might have played to a 1-all draw in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium on Saturday but they indeed left a lot to talk about after the game.For the past three seasons the crowd have witnessed dull Soweto Derby draw matches but today&rsquo;s clash lived up to its expectation.Pirates, who are still looking for a win in 2017, showed their desperation to get a victory when they started attacking Chiefs from the whistle go. Bucs could have opened the scoring in the 9th minute into the game but goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune was outstanding on the day. Bucs launched three attacks in a space of five minutes with Thembinkosi Lorch having a chance to score his first derby goal but Khune saved everything that was hit on him to keep the score 0-0.However, it was the home side that silenced Pirates&rsquo; fans in the 16th minute when Joseph Molangoane tapped in Bernard Parker&rsquo;s cut back on a close range. Molangoane could have immediately banged a brace but his lack of composure inside the box let him down as Brighton Mhlongo came out of his line to save Molangoane&rsquo;s effort.Buccaneers kept pressing on, as they were looking to level the matters and their efforts were awarded in the 33rd minutes when Lorch headed in to beat Khune on his near post. From there, the game started to open up with both teams attacking each other but the two goalkeepers were absolutely on form and the game went half time 1-all. In the second stanza, Amakhosi could have buried things with the last 8 minutes of the game but Mhlongo produced a man of the match saved when he stopped Willard Katsande&rsquo;s penalty after Ayanda Gcaba handled the ball inside the box. New Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret was hoping to get his first win since at the helm, however, Bucs loyalists would be happy that he didn&rsquo;t lose against their arch rivals. It was Jonevret&rsquo;s second match since joined the club a week ago. They played 1-1 with Polokwane City last week at Orlando Stadium. The Glamour Boys are 5th in the league table with 35 points from 20 games and their counterpart Pirates have 22 points after 19 games and sits at 11th place.&nbsp;
