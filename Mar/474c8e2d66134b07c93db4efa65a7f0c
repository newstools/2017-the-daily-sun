SASSA CEO Thokozani Magwaza says Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini blocked his efforts to speak to the courts about the grants crisis.Magwaza said Dlamini blocked his desperate efforts to report back to the Constitutional Court about the payment of social grants, and directly interfered with attempts to find a solution to the crisis.Magwaza, who broke his silence on the grants crisis, listed a number of occasions, dating as early as last month, when his office was ready to petition the court for guidance, only to be abruptly stopped by last-minute instructions from Dlamini.He was speaking just days before tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline for Sassa to explain to the Constitutional Court why it had handled the social grants in the manner it did, and why it had failed to communicate with the court.With Cash Paymaster Services&rsquo; contract to distribute grants to more than 17 million South Africans expiring on 31 March, citizens remain in the dark about how the grants will be distributed from next month. Magwaza, who has been on sick leave for more than a week amid speculation that he may be suspended, told City Press Dlamini got in the way of papers being filed in the Constitutional Court three times. &ndash; NEWS24
