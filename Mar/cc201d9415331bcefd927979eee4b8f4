Orlando Pirates received a boost during the international break as fan favorite Thabo Qalinge returned to training after a one month injury lay-off.Qalinge's trickery and ability to play on either flank will hand new head coach Kjell Jonevret a welcomed option, when returning to full fitness, as Thabo Rakhale remains sidelined.According to the club's official website, the following players are still nursing minor injuries: Riyaad Norodien (stubbed toe), Ntsikelelo Nyauza, Tendai Ndoro (mild hamstring strains) and Ayanda Gcaba (ankle strain).A statement on the club's official website read: "(Thabo) Qalinge, who has had a long layoff due to a combination of back and hamstring pain, has returned to full training for the first time in over a month."Meanwhile, Thabo Rakhale, who has been out for almost the same time as Qalinge, continues to undergo rehabilitation on his hamstring injury under the watchful eye of Biokineticist Stephen Plummer."Apart from the bumps and bruises which are common in a contact sport such as football, the Bucs medical team is pleased to report a pleasantly low register in their injury room."The Buccaneers will resume their Premiership campaign on the 1st of April, facing off against Free State Stars at the James Motlatsi Stadium.
