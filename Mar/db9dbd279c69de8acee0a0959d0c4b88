MORE than 100 wooden crosses have been standing on the side of Kyalami&rsquo;s busy Main Road since Monday as a silent protest over the death of Life Esidimeni patients.Nobody saw who planted the crosses, and passersby as well as motorists have been left puzzled about the protest&rsquo;s origins.Daily Sun visited the area, however, and discovered the person behind it all was a nearby orchard shop owner, Bill Butherford.A billboard put up with the crosses carries a clear message for all to read: &ldquo;Stop this depraved conduct. ESIDIMENI &ndash; 104 dead and counting.&rdquo; Bill told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I am not a politician and I am not looking for fame. I just wanted to pass on a message, that enough is enough.&rdquo; Over 100 mentally ill Life Esidimeni patients died when they were moved last June from their facilities to allegedly illegal mental health NGOs. Causes of death have not all been confirmed.Gauteng Finance MEC Barbara Creecy has come to the support of the health department, which has to implement the recommendations of a scathing report by the health ombudsman.Creecy on Tuesday announced that the provincial treasury has budgeted R893,8 million for mental care services in the province.
