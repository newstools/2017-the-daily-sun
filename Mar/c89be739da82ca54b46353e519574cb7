SOLANG Mtshweni&rsquo;s lover was not prepared to share her with anyone and his jealousy ended up having deadly consequences. After seeing her walking with another man, he allegedly hit her over the head with a beer bottle before stabbing her in the neck twice and leaving her for dead next to the road! The 29-year-old victim&rsquo;s aunt, Meisie (36) told Daily Sun the trouble started when the boyfriend from Winterveld, Tshwane, visited the family home on Saturday at about 8pm. &ldquo;Solang was asleep and I woke her up. He also called me to the back of the house and we sat on the stoep. He accused Solang of cheating on him, but she denied it,&rdquo; said Meisie. &ldquo;He then asked Solang to go to the shop with him to buy a cool drink. He assured her everything was fine between them.&rdquo; Meisie said a few minutes later people came by to tell her Solang was dead. &ldquo;We found her still in her pyjamas, lying in a pool of blood,&rdquo; said Meisie. The suspect allegedly handed himself over at Loate cop shop on Sunday. Police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said he appeared in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court briefly on Monday and the case was postponed.
