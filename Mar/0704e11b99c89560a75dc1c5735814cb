He gives us something different, and I believe that he has something special."The Dutchman is, however, cautious of putting too much pressure on a player who is in his first season in the professional ranks."Grant is still young and we have to monitor him to ensure that we don't overplay him. We have to make sure that we manage him properly. We have to keep him fresh, both mentally and physically."Margeman has played in nine league games for the Urban Warriors this season and has scored two goals and also provided a couple of assists.
