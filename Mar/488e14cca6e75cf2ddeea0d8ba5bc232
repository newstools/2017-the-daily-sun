A MAN and his friends are behind bars for allegedly beating his sister&rsquo;s former boyfriend to death. The boyfriend apparently started harassing the sister after she dumped him and things got so bad that he tried to hack her with an axe and almost burnt her to death! The brother and his two friends appeared in the Matatiele Magistrates Court yesterday and were denied bail. The suspects were arrested by the Afsondering police for allegedly murdering a 31-year-old man in Pamlaville Village. They are accused of beating the victim to death after he tried to burn down a rondavel belonging to the sister of one of the accused at her homestead. The trouble started last month after the woman dumped the victim, who lived in the same village. He started harassing her until the situation spun out of control last weak. Matatiele police spokesman Captain Raphael Motloung said the victim had been at the woman&rsquo;s homestead twice on the night of his murder. During his first visit he set alight the door of the rondavel. The woman was inside but neighbours put out the fire. &ldquo;The man returned an hour later with an axe. He started hacking the door of another rondavel he believed she was hiding in. &ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s brother and his friends then allegedly disarmed the man and started beating him. He died soon after being beaten. The suspects are charged with murder.&rdquo;
