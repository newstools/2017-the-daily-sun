THE body of a 29-year-old man was found in an outside room of a house in Tladi, Soweto, on Thursday. The discovery came a day after another man (37) had held his girlfriend (31) hostage in the main house on the property for 12 hours before wounding her and then shooting himself dead. The 29-year-old man, who is believed to have been a tenant in the yard, was shot in the chest.The body was discovered by police when the sister of the dead man came looking for him after seeing news of the hostage drama on TV. A neighbour said the man was last seen on Monday.&ldquo;The sister of the dead man came to my house and asked if I had seen or spoken to him.&rdquo;The man&rsquo;s sister had gone to her brother&rsquo;s back room and found it locked. Another neighbour said no one had been living in the rooms for a while. A member of the family that owns the house said he was not aware that someone had lived in the outside rooms.He had wanted to move some of the furniture in the main house into one of the rooms. &ldquo;My dad said to me someone is living there. I ended up not moving the things.&rdquo;Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said a doctor had confirmed that the man killed in the outside room had been dead for 36 hours. &ldquo;There were cellphones confiscated at the scene and a family member recognised one of them as her brother&rsquo;s.
