Volunteers from Small Project Foundation in Nelson Mandela Bay have been telling residents how important it is to know their HIV status. They test people for the virus in a mobile clinic. On Friday they set up their tent in front of Tshangana Clinic in New Brighton kasi, Port Elizabeth. Many people, young and old, came to be tested for HIV, high blood pressure and diabetes. Foundation volunteer Phumla Mntuyedwa said: &ldquo;More older people are now testing HIV-positive. &ldquo;We believe it&rsquo;s because there are many sugar dads and mamas in our communities. We need to focus more on senior citizens. &ldquo;We counsel and prepare victims for a new life with the virus. We tell them it is best to start ARV treatment soon. We encourage those who test negative to look after themselves and not to have risky sex.&rdquo; She said they are 10 volunteers. &ldquo;We use door-to-door campaigns to encourage residents to be tested even if some of them insult us.&rdquo; New Brighton resident Nothemba Maqanda (41) said: &ldquo;They are doing a great job. I always go for tests when I see them.&rdquo;
