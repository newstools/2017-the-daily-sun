PROSPER Rengane (28) has always gone out of his way to help people in his kasi &ndash; but it almost got him killed.His bakkie is damaged and he is licking his wounds at his house at Rand Water section in Winterveld, Tshwane. He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My angry neighbour smashed my bakkie and stabbed me with a bottle.&rdquo;Prosper said the woman living with his neighbour asked him to move her furniture from her lover&rsquo;s house to her new place on Saturday, and he agreed.He was busy and asked his cousin to use his red Nissan 1400 to take the woman to Hammanskraal. At the time the woman&rsquo;s boyfriend was not home, but all hell broke loose when he came back and found her gone.Prosper said: &ldquo;He came to my house and accused me of taking his woman away from him. I tried to explain that I thought they were moving together, but he wouldn&rsquo;t listen. He smashed my bakkie&rsquo;s windows with a beer bottle. He even jumped on top and kicked out the windscreen.&ldquo;He then took four beer bottles and smashed them on my head and stabbed me twice, all the time swearing at me. &ldquo;He also broke the windows of my house. I&rsquo;ve never feared for my life like this.&rdquo; Prosper said when he went to report the matter to the police, they refused to help him.&ldquo;They told me to bring my passport first.&rdquo; Captain Samuel Sebola from the Loate police said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Prosper and open a case.&rdquo;
