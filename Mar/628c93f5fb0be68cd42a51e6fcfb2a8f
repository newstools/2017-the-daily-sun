He said: “These people are taking me for a ride because of my disability. I need the money for my monthly visits to my doctor in Joburg. “I don’t know what else to do because I keep submitting all the necessary invoices, but nobody seems to receive them.”Mastoki Motsau, a financial officer in the municipality’s supply chain department, said Thabo has had the problem for a long time. “We need to find out what happened, as there have been changes in management and administration. “I will contact Thabo and we will take it from there.“I can’t promise he will get his money soon because it’s a lengthy process.” Tshidi Tshabalala, a communications officer at the mayor’s office, said: “We have received Thabo’s complaint along with his invoices. “We will be able to respond to his concerns in 48 hours.”
