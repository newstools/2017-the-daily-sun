IT&rsquo;S been just one week since Orlando Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret landed in Mzansi, and he&rsquo;s had to hit the ground running! On Saturday , his new charges will be facing up to the tough challenge of playing their Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium. There is a lot at stake and a win for Pirates could lighten up things for Bucs fans.&nbsp; It will be Jonevret's second game at the helm of the club.Bucs drew 1-1 with Polokwane City last Saturday in a league match. Things haven't been going Bucs&rsquo; way, as the club has failed to secure a win in its last ten fixtures. The Swede is under immense pressure to turn things around. But Jonevret looked cool enough when he said: "We hope it will be a fun&nbsp; Saturday . We hope it will be a special day to remember." "It's my first derby, so I haven't had any draws in a derby yet. I know nothing about draws."
