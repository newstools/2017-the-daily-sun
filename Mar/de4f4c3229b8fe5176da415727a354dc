PRESIDENT Robert Mugabe's donation of biscuits, Zapnax
(the local equivalent of Niknaks) and water to some of the victims of floods in
southern Zimbabwe has been coming under intense scrutiny.According to a Twitter post by Jonathan Moyo, Zimbabwe's
higher education minister who's also the MP for Tsholotsho where many of the
displaced come from, Mugabe sent 1 000 
packs of Zapnax, 1 000 bottles of mineral water and 1 000 packs of
biscuits. There were many other donations, including from schools,
a safari company, a church and aid groups.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss5IyD4kIdeVtWcOdFbfTjSlRknjKbKZwqkN1Pn3b3hJ6MFwOH94udqRJWvK-VTADqNJmT-bvr0Ql-Q8MSrUFGurfzBAYJe-kR15UYHD3naAjnF0gScUrUusAgb0CbBB0ZTueoXc5nBoXhevpb8n6ndq1yW7jxJjrwKQnAWuWNP16drJdjzXNihsMo7X-xZnRpch-dLTGqtPFQvm_0cJVjjMFgoqxZ1d-nu5eBEJNb2g0kG554HPaa4oLlostgF8ULINXBS8XAwvNotUISXHy8D04AE1kkcjsv5QA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHwtUJx8pFdZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

tropical storm Dineo ripped through the region. At least 900 people are still
living in a camp for the displaced in Tsholotsho district. Across Zimbabwe, 2
000 people were displaced.While there's no doubt that water and foodstuffs
(non-perishable foodstuffs at that) are desperately needed by those currently
living in tents, a number of Zimbabweans still view Mugabe's donation in a poor
light."We are doomed," tweeted @MakomboreroH, the
secretary general of the Zimbabwe National Students' Union in response to the
report of Mugabe's gift.Obert Gutu, the spokesperson for the main opposition MDC
told the privately-run Daily News
that Mugabe's donation was in "extreme bad taste"."It's arrogance of the highest order for him to send
the victims donated biscuits, Zapnaxs and bottled mineral water. This shows
Mugabe’s utter contempt for the toiling masses of Zimbabwe," the paper
quoted Gutu as saying.On Twitter, Home Affairs Minister Saviour Kasukuwere
welcomed all the donations and the feedback from Moyo (who himself donated
groceries to the displaced). He tweeted: "We will work to build back
better."There is just one thing to note though: Mugabe (who
recently had to have a plane chartered for him from Bahrain) may not
necessarily choose to eat Zapnax, which are produced in Harare.The president was snapped snacking on imported Lays
crisps during his 93rd birthday party last month. http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/jet-setting-mugabe-gave-biscuits-to-flood-displaced-20170315
