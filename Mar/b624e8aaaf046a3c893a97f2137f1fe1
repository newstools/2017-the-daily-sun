The South African men&rsquo;s contingent will be headed by world No 14 Evans Maripa, with world No 38 Leon Els also carrying the country&rsquo;s hopes.&ldquo;I am really looking forward to returning to South Africa again. It is always a buzz to return to a venue where you have won titles,&rdquo; said Houdet.&ldquo;I really enjoy the tournament in South Africa, the people are friendly and the weather is always welcoming.&rdquo;Heading the women&rsquo;s field will be 2016 Wimbledon champion and world No 1 Jiske Griffioen, who will be back at the so-called &ldquo;grand old lady of tennis&rdquo; Ellis Park to defend her title.
