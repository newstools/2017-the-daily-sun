DLAMANI High School is one of the most overcrowded schools in Limpopo. More than 120 pupils are squeezed into a classroom. The education department&rsquo;s pupil-teacher ratio prescribes that there should be no more than 40 pupils per teacher.Located in Nyavani Village outside Malamulele, the school has only 15 classrooms for its 1 110 pupils.One teacher said it was difficult to teach. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to get pupils&rsquo; attention or deal with them individually. &ldquo;We are forced to have extra lessons on weekends. &ldquo;We came to realise that if we don&rsquo;t give extra lessons on weekends, the pupils would fail in a big way.&rdquo; According to the teacher, the overcrowding problem goes back to about nine years ago.&ldquo;We have reported it to the department countless times and are given empty promises all the time. &ldquo;They promised to build us extra classes but to date, nothing materialised. We once again are appealing to the government to help us before the future of our pupils is destroyed.&rdquo;Grade 8 pupil Vroy Maluleke said attending school at Dlamani is no fun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not happy because there isn&rsquo;t enough space for us to learn. Sometimes I think of staying home but my parents refuse.&ldquo;Please Daily Sun, tell the government to build us extra classes so we can learn properly like other children in other provinces.&rdquo; Limpopo education spokesperson Naledzani Rasila said: &ldquo;We are aware we have a shortage of infrastructure in some schools in the province. &ldquo;But the department is continuously delivering in terms of refurbishing and building state of the art schools. Unfortunately, we are working within available resources which are limited, compared to the demand we have in the province.&rdquo;
