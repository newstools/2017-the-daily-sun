MAMELODI SUNDOWNS&rsquo; new rising star, Thapelo Morena, is relishing the prospect of making his Caf Champions League debut when the defending champions host Kampala Capital City Authority in their first round, first leg tie at Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow (7pm).The 23-year-old, who can play on the right wing or at right-back, joined the Brazilians from Bloemfontein Celtic last August, but was not registered with the Confederation of African Football (Caf) last year. He was therefore unable to take part in Downs&rsquo; campaign that saw them crowned African champs.Thapelo has recently come into his own playing at right-back and is a regular in head coach Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s starting lineup. He admits this is his favourite position.Said Morena: &ldquo;I prefer to play at right-back, as I can create more space and can use my speed more effectively.&rdquo;He said he had worked hard since joining Sundowns on a five-year contract and has not looked back: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now registered with Caf and ready to deliver. &ldquo;I watched the players win the Champions League last year and now it is hopefully my turn to help Sundowns retain the title and make more history for the club.&rdquo;He capped an outstanding performance in the recent 6-0 hammering of Orlando Pirates in an Absa Premiership fixture at Loftus Versfeld when he scored a brace.Said Morena: &ldquo;I have been working hard on my game and want to keep improving. Hopefully I can play for Bafana Bafana some day.&rdquo;Morena played for his country at Under-23 level and represented Young Bafana at last year&rsquo;s Rio Olympics. He is looking forward to playing against the Ugandan champions: &ldquo;This will be my first game in the Champions League and I aim to make the most of it. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know a lot about our opponents. We still have to study DVDs of their matches. They will know all about us after we won the competition last year, so we&rsquo;re expecting a tough night. But we will fight to make sure we keep our title.&rdquo;
