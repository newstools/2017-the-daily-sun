ANC veteran Ahmed Kathrada will be remembered for his patience and generosity, a former Robben Island prisoner said today.Eddie Daniels, a former Liberal Party member, said Kathrada embraced him with generosity when he arrived on the island. They became good friends."He was sentenced to life imprisonment and I was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. I was the only member of my organisation to go to Robben Island," Daniels said."When I got there, I was all alone and he made me feel welcome. When you are alone under trying conditions, your morale goes [down], but Kathy was there for me," he said.Kathrada died in the early hours of Tuesday morning. He was 87. He had undergone surgery relating to a blood clot on the brain earlier this month, but experienced post-operative complications and contracted pneumonia in both lungs."I will remember him for his patience, generosity, his quietness. Whenever there was trouble brewing, he used his passiveness to calm everyone down," Daniels said.He said the youth should uplift each other, like all struggle heroes did in the past."Instead of fighting one another, they should find one another. The youth should share everything with one another."Friends, family, and dignitaries are saying their goodbyes to Kathrada at Westpark Cemetery, Johannesburg, from 10:00.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kathy-was-there-for-me-former-robben-island-prisoner-20170329
