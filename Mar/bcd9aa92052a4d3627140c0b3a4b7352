AN UNFINISHED RDP must have been built by ghosts! This is because no department has any record of signing off on its construction, and the contractor who supposedly started building it denies doing so.The situation has left gogo Namkiti Nkosi (77) and madala Stewart Hleta (72) from Ekulindeni, Mpumalanga with a cracked floor, partially painted walls, no electrical wiring and no ceiling. Gogo Namkiti said: &ldquo;My children had to patch up part of the wall where it meets the roof as the cement and bricks have started crumbling. The roof leaks when it rains and I fear it might be blown away.&rdquo; Madala Steward said they are living in a cracked mud hut behind the RDP while waiting for the contractor to come back and finish his job. Young Communist League secretary Xolani Shiba said the construction of the house was signed off by former public works MEC Dumisile Nhlengethwa. &ldquo;The pensioners&rsquo; mud house was damaged by blasting during the construction of a nearby road. This was one of many projects in the area where unqualified contractors were hired,&rdquo; he said. However, the contractor told Daily Sun he didn&rsquo;t know anything about the house. Human settlements spokesman Freddy Ngobe said gogo Namkiti was still on the waiting list for a house. Public works spokesman David Nkambule said the contractor was not on their database and could not have been hired for the work.
