CRICKET player Siphe Mzaidume&rsquo;s dream of making it big overseas has allegedly been stumped.&nbsp;This after the star failed to raise money to get back to the United Kingdom where he was playing.&nbsp;Sunday Sun sources alleged Siphe was squatting in Jozi and was battling to get money to go back to the UK.&nbsp;Siphe, who is from Port Alfred, in the Eastern Cape, made headlines when he claimed that Cricket South Africa was unwilling to select black players for the national team.&nbsp;Three years later, a source claimed that Siphe was stuck in the Jozi suburb of Kensington, where he&rsquo;s said to have been squatting with a white female friend since last year.&nbsp;&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have money to go back to the UK. White females believe his story when he tells them he plays cricket in the UK and shows them his pictures while he was abroad.&nbsp;&ldquo;Siphe has been squatting here in Joburg since last year and didn&rsquo;t go home during the holidays because he&rsquo;s embarrassed by his situation,&rdquo; the source claimed.&nbsp;Another source alleged that Siphe always asks his mum, who is a teacher by profession, for money to get by.&nbsp;&ldquo;I feel for his mum. Siphe should just swallow his pride and go back home in the Eastern Cape and look for a job.&nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too old to be asking for money from his mum. He&rsquo;s toying around with white women in Jozi because he&rsquo;s too shy to go back home.&nbsp;&ldquo;If he was earning good money overseas, how come he doesn&rsquo;t own a flat or a car, at least?&nbsp;&ldquo;The guy is living a lie. I pity those white ladies who are bankrolling him, thinking he&rsquo;s a cricket star,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;When the SunTeam called Siphe for comment, a person who answered his phone claimed that he had sold the phone to them and no longer owned it.&nbsp;
