THE evil fire came when no one was in the house, eating up everything of value. But the house owner, mlungu Desmond Maxton, said this was no ordinary fire.He believes jealous people who are against his progress in life sent evil vutha to his house!The fire on Wednesday in Bez Valley, Joburg, saw everything inside the six-room house burn to ashes.The 48-year-old told Daily Sun jealous people began targeting him a week ago after he got a job.&ldquo;They want to see me miserable.&ldquo;That is why they are sending mysterious fires.&ldquo;I know evil people are behind this and I will get to the bottom of it,&rdquo; said Desmond.Now Desmond and his five children are without a roof over their heads.He said the fire started around midday when no one was home.&ldquo;Community members broke into the house trying to put out the fire, but it was too strong,&rdquo; he said.One of the neighbours said they saw smoke rising from the house.&ldquo;We were passing Desmond&rsquo;s house when we saw smoke coming out the window.&ldquo;We called to him and his kids, but no one was home. We then came together as residents and broke down the door and started extinguishing the fire,&rdquo; said the resident.Another resident said in the end it took them three hours to put out all the flames, but the fire had already caused serious damage.Desmond said he was called while at work. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe all I had is gone. Our clothes, food and everything that belonged to my children.&rdquo; Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni says anyone can be hit with vutha. &ldquo;People do buy vutha from evil sangomas at a cost of less than R2 000,&rdquo; he said. Nana Radebe from Joburg Emergency Services said officials managed to put out the fire that was left in the building after responding to a call at about 2:50pm.
