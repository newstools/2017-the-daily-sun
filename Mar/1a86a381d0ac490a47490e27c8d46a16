The classrooms were built in 1986. &ldquo;In 2012, officials from the department came and saw the condition our school was in.&rdquo; Lubelu said the department told them they were number five in line for a new school but nothing has been built. The officials visited them again in 2015.Lubelu said nine classrooms and the staffroom leak when it rains. Teacher Nothiswa Sigebetshu said: &ldquo;I have been teaching here for 20 years. This roof has been fixed many times, but instead of things getting better, they are worse.&rdquo; Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department will send officials to Ndlumbini to check the school and see if the maintenance budget can be used to fix the roof.&ldquo;We will know what to do after we get their report,&rdquo; said Mtima.&ldquo;We will talk to district officials to find out why the school was not fixed. When a school is identified as needing repairs, it has to be done.&ldquo;We will fix the school.&rdquo;
