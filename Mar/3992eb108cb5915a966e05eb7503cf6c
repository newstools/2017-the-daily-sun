THE booming shisa nyama businesses and stray animals are to blame for the sharp increase in stock theft cases. Police say some thieves sell the meat of stolen cows and sheep to shisa nyama owners, while other animals are smuggled across our borders. A joint cross-border operation by cops, stock theft detectives, the South African National Defence Force and anti-stock theft units started off on the right foot. So far, hundreds of suspected stolen sheep and nine cows worth thousands of rands, have been were recovered. Free State police spokesman Sergeant Mmako Mophiring said: &ldquo;Since the operation kicked off, three suspects have been arrested at Tseseng Village. &ldquo;They were found in possession of four cattle. &ldquo;The aim of the operation is to tackle and address stock theft in the Phuthaditjhaba cluster. The police station situated near the Lesotho-Free State border is the one most affected in the province. &ldquo;During the operation, a dozen suspects were caught at Namahadi Village for transporting animals without accompanying documents. &ldquo;This is a huge success.&rdquo; Mophiring added that they believe the shisa nyama businesses which are mushrooming every day in QwaQwa were contributing to stock theft in the area. Mophiring said they believe that shisa nyama owners buy meat from thieves cheaply. Also, some livestock owners neglect their animals and leave them unattended. Police are urging farmers and owners to be more vigilant and to make sure their animals are kept in safe places at all times. The operation will continue across the province.
