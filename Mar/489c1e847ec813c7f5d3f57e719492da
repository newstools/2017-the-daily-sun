AFTER years of struggling, Jabulane is about to give up. The frustrated and desperate Jabulane Vilakazi (31) from Lawley, south of Joburg, is wandering the streets searching for love. He told the SunTeam he is looking for a single woman who is ready to settle down &ndash; and really doesn&rsquo;t care how old or young she is. Jabulane said in the past, the women in his life only wanted his money. He complains that they dump him after they poke him. &ldquo;All I want is someone who will love me for who I am, not for my money.&rdquo; Jabulane said he is a kind and loving person but the women he meets don&rsquo;t appreciate him. He also said he tried married women, but that doesn&rsquo;t work as he ends up falling in love with them. &ldquo;Time isn&rsquo;t on my side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to start a family. Getting old scares me as I might die before making that a reality.&rdquo; He has even tried wearing shirts with ties and formal shoes, hoping it would work but women still reject him. &ldquo;I want a woman who is going to respect me, love me, make time for me and give me kids,&rdquo; said Jabulane. But not every woman qualifies. &ldquo;She mustn&rsquo;t be too fat, must be good looking and keep the spark alive in our relationship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe my soul mate is out there, waiting for me.&rdquo; Daily Sun sangoma Mahlinza Dlamini said: &ldquo;It could be that women don&rsquo;t get aroused or feel excited with him in bed. &ldquo;He must perform a manly ritual to get rid of this bad luck.&rdquo;
