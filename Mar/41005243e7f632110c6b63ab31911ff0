ON MONDAY afternoon, two cops nearly received a beating from angry taxi passengers. A police truck crashed into their taxi on Caroline Street, Brixton. The passengers were mad and claimed the police driver was responsible. Furious Dinah Morewa (30) said the taxi had right of way when the truck smashed into it. &ldquo;He was moving at high speed and couldn&rsquo;t turn the corner. He was hurtling towards and decided to brake.We just wanted to ask him why he did what he did. This man wanted to kill us. &rdquo; Another commuter said: &ldquo;We always say taximen are bad drivers but these people are even worse. We could have been killed because of him.&rdquo; Luckily the police truck was empty. But the shocked taxi driver said: &ldquo;I only started driving this taxi three weeks ago. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do now.&rdquo; Captain Gordon Belling said one person was injured in the incident. &ldquo;A case of reckless driving and negligence was opened and is being investigated.&rdquo;
