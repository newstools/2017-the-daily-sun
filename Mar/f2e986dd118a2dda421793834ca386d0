GOLDEN Arrows assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi admits they face a mammoth task when they line up against Highlands Park at the weekend.Firstly, their players could still be rusty for this Absa Premiership clash at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu on Saturday (3pm). This is the third week in a row Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende have not played competitively. Secondly, Highlands are still briming with confidence after they beat Maritzburg United (1-0) in their last league match, while Arrows lost their last match 2-0 to Platinum Stars on 19 March. Thirdly, playing against a team fighting for survival could be risky, as Highlands might extend their winning streak at Arrows&rsquo; expense. Lastly, the Lions of the North have an experienced coach in Gordon Igesund, who knows how to bounce back from difficult situations. However, Ncikazi said they were looking forward to playing competitively again after their last friendly against Bafana Bafana last week.&ldquo;We had a good break. We even got the rare opportunity to play a training match against our senior national team. Bafana Bafana gave us a good run, despite the result (1-0 win for Bafana). I think our players did very well.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;Highlands have proved that they are no pushovers. I must admit, this match will be difficult for both teams. It will be a clash of two styles.&rdquo;Despite his concerns, Ncikazi reckons they can beat Highlands but would not commit to predicting the final score.The good news is that Arrows will welcome back Danny Phiri, Kagisho Dikgacoi and Vuyani Ntanga from an assortment of injuries. &ldquo;Having Phiri back is really good for the team,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been the missing link in our midfield. Now Musa (Bilankulu) can start focusing on his own duties. He has done well on his own in that position.&rdquo; He said, however, that Limbikani Mzava and Philani Cele were doubtful for the match but would undergo late fitness tests.
