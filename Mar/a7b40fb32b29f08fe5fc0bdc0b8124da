Mamelodi Sundowns are hopeful that talisman Khama Billiat will return to action this weekend - just in time for the start of their CAF Champions League defence.Sundowns begin their 2017 continental campaign when they square up to Ugandan champions Kampala Capital City Authority FC at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday night.It is a first round encounter after the 2016 champions were given a bye in the preliminary round.Having missed the services of Billiat for the last couple of domestic encounters, the Sundowns website has reported that the Zimbabwean could well feature against the Ugandans."Khama Billiat is likely to return to give the frontline that impetus that has been missing in the last two games while he was out injured. He would also have benefited from the rest, and will be charged up," the official club website stated.Meanwhile, despite Denis Onyango recovering from injury, Wayne Sandilands is expected to keep his place in goal."Chances are that the gloves will once more go to Wayne Sandilands, as [head coach Pitso] Mosimane will not lightly risk the return from injury of Onyango, and Sandilands has proved himself more than capable between the sticks," their website reported.
