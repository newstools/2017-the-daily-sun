TWO families have been living with lakes of sewage in their backyards since 2013. This is because Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality failed to repair pipes that burst near their Port Elizabeth homes.The families spend most of their time inside their houses as the dirty water attracts flies and mosquitoes. Phumla Shaik (54) and her neighbour, Mbuyiselo Vena (41), of Wells Estate, said their problems started just three days after they moved into their RDP houses. Phumla told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are living in hell here. It&rsquo;s like a bad dream. I have personally phoned the municipality on several occasions and they kept assuring me they will fix the problem. &ldquo;I have reference numbers to prove this. The dirty water causes itches and sores all over our bodies. My children are teased by their schoolmates, who say they are dirty. I sometimes vomit from the smell.&rdquo; Phumla said her two-year-old grandson was often ill and had sores on his hands.She said the sewage also attracted pigs, which made a noise all night. &ldquo;The sewage has also flowed into the nearby playground. I approached our former councillor, who assured us the municipality was working on the problem but nothing has been done.&rdquo;Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said he had referred complaints to the engineering department. &ldquo;We have arranged for a super sucker to be on the site this week,&rdquo; he said.
