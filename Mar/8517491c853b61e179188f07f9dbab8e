DESPITE being elevated to the second spot in the latest World Boxing Organisation&rsquo;s (WBO) cruiserweight rankings, Mzansi boxing golden boy Kevin &ldquo;The K O Kid&rdquo; Lerena, is not in a hurry to challenge for the world title. The highly rated Lerena has stepped up from fifth position to the second spot of WBO rankings, which brings him closer to a title held by Oleksandr Usyk, the Ukrainian professional boxer who has held the WBO cruiserweight title since last year.Lerena is second behind former WBO Youth and current WBO International cruiserweight champion, Noel Gevor. His mentor, Peter Smith, believes the hard-hitting fighter needs to fight more credible opponents, which will give him more experience. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy for him. Although we are top-rated, we&rsquo;re not in a hurry to challenge for the world title,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;The champion is willing to fight Lerena on a good deal, but we want to build him by fighting top contenders, so that we can negotiate better financial rewards. &ldquo;South Africa has a pull of good boxers, but they&rsquo;re not groomed to be real contenders. They&rsquo;re champions, but don&rsquo;t last on the international stage,&rdquo; he said. The 24-year-old rising star is due to fight in the US on 14 April. He has a golden opportunity to make an incredible first impression on the US hard-to-please public. The former WBC Youth Silver cruiserweight champion has displayed a sensational performance, winning all his three fights, including being crowned the Super Four Cruiserweight king. He gave the then unbeaten Danish prospect, Micki Nielsen, his first taste of defeat lift the super Four belt. The talented southpaw opens this year&rsquo;s account by blowing away Namibia&rsquo;s Vikapita Meroro in fifth round to improve his record to 17 victories and a single defeat.
