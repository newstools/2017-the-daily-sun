I believe this incident happened because of drugs.&rdquo;She said social workers will be available until surviving family members&rsquo; souls are healed. &ldquo;It is shocking that a one-year-old baby witnessed the massacre. I was told the baby was lying in a pool of blood but was not shot.&rdquo;Mbongeni Mzila (59), a family spokesman, said something like this has never happened in their family. &ldquo;But we believe that God is still with us.&rdquo;He thanked Umlazi residents for their support.&ldquo;I heard that after the shooting they gathered in support. We are very grateful.&rdquo; He said some people believe the incident happened because they don&rsquo;t believe in ancestors.After the incident, a 25-year-old suspect was arrested and appeared in the Umlazi Magistrates Court for a bail application. He&rsquo;s expected to appear again on Friday.
