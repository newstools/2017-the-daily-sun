THE tentacles of the Gupta empire have found a strong hold on the majority of ANC ministers.It seems their project of state capture has in fact become an ANC project. This was the scathing claim made yesterday by DA leader Mmusi Maimane. Maimane revealed that he had sent letters to every minister, asking each to answer to parliament whether they had met with any Gupta family member or affiliates at their Saxonwold Estate in Joburg, or anywhere else, since taking office. Maimane listed those ministers who have dealt with the controversial Gupta family, as well as those who refused to answer. The ministers&rsquo; written responses reveal the following: The Ministers of Finance, Defence, Economic Development, Energy, Home Affairs and Trade and Industry all admitted to having attended social events where the Guptas were present.Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies stated that he had met them on several occasions.Des van Rooyen, Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, and Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane both denied having met with the Guptas despite the former Public Protector&rsquo;s state of capture report providing concrete evidence to the contrary.The Ministers of Environmental Affairs, Public Enterprises, Sport and Recreation, State Security and Women in the Presidency all flatly refused to answer.The Minister of Energy admitted to meeting with Gupta employees Nazeem Howa and Moegsien Williams at breakfasts hosted by the Gupta newspaper The New Age.Lindiwe Zulu, the Minister of Small Business Development, refused even to reply.The Minister of Finance avoided answering the question as it related to his deputy Mcebisi Jonas, who publicly proclaimed he was personally offered his post by the Guptas in 2015.Maimane added that lying to parliament was a serious offence and that the DA would take action if people were proved to have lied.
