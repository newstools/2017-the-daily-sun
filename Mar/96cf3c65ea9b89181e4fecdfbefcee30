KAIZER Chiefs head coach Steve Komphela admits the stakes are high when they tackle defending Absa Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns at the FNB Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm) &ndash; but he is not shaken by the prospect at all. While the Amakhosi mentor is desperate for three points he will not compromise: &ldquo;We are a big club and as a coach I know we must get results. Although this is a big match we&rsquo;ll play the game the Chiefs way.&rdquo; However, his opposite number at Downs, Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s philosophy for the match is to win at all costs: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried how we play &ndash; I ask forgiveness now from our fans &ndash; but it is the result that is important at this stage of the season. We have nine matches in April. On current league form we are the underdogs.&rdquo; Komphela laughed off this suggestion by Mosimane about Downs, who are also the Africa champions. Said the Chiefs coach: &ldquo;That statement by Pitso that Sundowns are the underdogs &ndash; I don&rsquo;t buy it one little bit. I beg to differ. Downs are deadly and their intentions in this match are clear.&rdquo; Mosimane replied that he had a mounting injury list and said playing in Africa had taken its toll on his squad: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not using that as an excuse but the fact that Chiefs are on a good run (10 games unbeaten) while we have failed to win our last three matches means we are underdogs.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Komphela said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show Sundowns the respect they deserve.&rdquo; The Chiefs mentor said he was not going to worry about avenging his side&rsquo;s 2-1 loss to Downs in the first round. Said Komphela :&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about revenge. That is not my style.&rdquo; The coaches did agree on one thing &ndash; there would be no need to motivate their players for this clash. Said Mosimane: &ldquo;There is no pep talk needed.&rdquo; Downs skipper Hlompho Kekana said his teammates were ready but added: &ldquo;There is also pride at stake in this match. We are not going into this match naively. &ldquo;We will be cautious but at the same time we need to collect as many points as possible, as we are still playing catch-up." "We know the task ahead and that Chiefs are dangerous in their backyard. We&rsquo;re excited about the game and ready to go there to play our part.&rdquo; Amakhosi keeper Itumeleng Khune said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try and make it an entertaining match but what is more important is the result and collecting the points.&rdquo; Chiefs skipper Siphiwe Tshabalala admitted: &ldquo;We are highly motivated.&rdquo;
