NTOMBI Vuma&rsquo;s yard is secured with a fence, a gate and a few dogs, so she believed her family was safe.But last Friday, her son Makabongwe Ndlovu (2) vanished right under her nose. He has still not been found. Ntombi, from Steenbok near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, said her son was playing with a neighbour&rsquo;s child (2) right under the kitchen window. &ldquo;I had them both in my sight all the time, as I was working in the kitchen. &ldquo;But a moment later he was gone. We searched all over, but he was nowhere to be found. Neighbours joined in and we covered an even bigger area, but my Makabongwe was gone.&rdquo;The search carried on almost until midnight, when Makabongwe&rsquo;s gogo on his father&rsquo;s side joined the search party. Many people accused the gogo of knowing where the boy was, as she only joined the search later that night. But she said she was just as worried about her grandson as everyone else. &ldquo;Residents accused me of abducting my grandson. I arrived late because I was still angry with my daughter-in-law for stealing my things.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s aunt, Linah Vuma (37), urged anyone who might have seen the boy to bring him home.Police spokesman Captain Mzwandile Nyambi confirmed that a missing person&rsquo;s case was opened and said the police were looking for the missing boy.
