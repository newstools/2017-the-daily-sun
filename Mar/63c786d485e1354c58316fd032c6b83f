TWO award-winning artists are allegedly at loggerheads!Sunday Sun sources say there&rsquo;s ill-feeling between Rebecca Malope and Robbie Malinga.One claims Ribbs roped Robbie in on a R1,7m road safety job she got from the Mpumalanga government.The source alleged: &ldquo;Robbie added another guy, whose firm actually did the job!&ldquo;Rebecca ended up with only R400&thinsp;000, while Robbie got a huge cut and also got himself a Merc ML immediately after the payout. He also went on vacation overseas,&rdquo; the source said. But an official of the provincial government told the SunTeam: &ldquo;For the department to pay that company was not wrong.&rdquo;When called for comment, Robbie said: &ldquo;Drop that story.
