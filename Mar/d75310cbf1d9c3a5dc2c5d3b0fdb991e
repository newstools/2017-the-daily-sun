PEOPLE are still in shock after 17 bodies were just thrown into shallow graves from a truck at their local cemetery. The bodies belonged to unidentified people who were allegedly mostly foreigners.They were buried as paupers. People who live close to the cemetery in Waterval in Makhado, Limpopo said they witnessed a mass burial at the beginning of the month.First the bodies were taken to the cemetery in two open trucks and then the coffins were just thrown into the graves. In some cases two coffins were put into one grave. The burial is said to have been the responsibility of the Makhado Municipality and Elim Hospital. Baldwin Mabogo, whose family owns a farm next to the cemetery, said they were looking after their livestock when they were overwhelmed by a stench. &ldquo;It was coming from the corner of the cemetery. When we went there we saw shallow graves only partly covered by soil.&ldquo;The graves didn&rsquo;t even have numbers,&rdquo; he said. Lucas Maszive, a cattle herder, said he saw the burial and was horrified. &ldquo;You could see from the way the coffins were handled that the workers didn&rsquo;t care. They threw them down into the graves like they were throwing the carcasses of decomposing animals,&rdquo; he said. Gogo Pauline Mabogo, who owns land next to the cemetery, said her workers had been complaining about the smell since last week. &ldquo;Some of my staff are no longer reporting for duty or they avoid the corner next to the cemetery,&rdquo; she said. Municipal spokesman Louis Bobodi said he had no record of the burial and would check to find out who was responsible for it.
