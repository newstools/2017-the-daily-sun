TUESDAY was International Mother Tongue Day. A topic that was celebrated was that maths is now taught in isiXhosa in some Eastern Cape schools. The event took place at the Uitenhage Town Hall and was hosted by the provincial department of education. Naledi Mbude, provincial director of language policy, told the audience: &ldquo;There is no policy that says a black pupil must change their language after Grade 3.&rdquo; She said while many black kids choose to be taught in languages other than isiXhosa after Grade 3, most Afrikaans- and English-speaking pupils hold on to their mother tongue. &ldquo;Our system shows that black pupils&rsquo; results are declining because they are taught in a language that is not theirs,&rdquo; she said. She said Section 29 of the Constitution states that school governing boards must preserve the home language of pupils, but in Mzansi this is not happening. She said there were 70 schools in Cofimvaba where maths had been taught in isiXhosa since 2012. &ldquo;In the annual assessment of 2014, it was found that the pupils who learnt maths in their mother tongue had an average pass rate of 70%, while those using English achieved only 65%,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have to fight for your right to be taught in your own language. &ldquo;After Grade 3, many black pupils dump their mother tongue to be taught in Afrikaans or English, and that&rsquo;s why they fail.&rdquo; The event was closed by the father of two kids, Simphiwe Kula (30), who thanked the department for hosting International Mother Tongue Day. Also attending were many school principals, teachers,&nbsp;pupils, governing board members and district education&nbsp;officials.
