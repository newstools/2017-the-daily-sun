NEW ORLANDO Pirates head coach Kjell Jonevret has breathed new life into the club. The Swedish born mentor has won the support of players and fans alike during his first week in charge.Midfield kingpin Riyaad Norodien is one of the stars who has welcomed Jonevret, brought in to steady the shaky Bucs ship last Monday.Norodien reckons Saturday&rsquo;s Absa Premiership Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium (3.30pm) is the perfect game to turn things around and put a smile on the faces of suffering fans &ndash; and their new coach.Said Norodien: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great working with the new coach. He understands players and is a good communicator. It&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to apply tactics we do at training in a match situation, but the new coach has made us understand we are a team. &ldquo;We are more united and understand each other&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses better. Communication is so important. The coach has also brought structure and organisation to the squad.&rdquo;Norodien said the fact Pirates had not won any of their last nine games should not make Chiefs feel comfortable: &ldquo;Form goes out the window in the derby,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;Chiefs would be making a big mistake if they take us for granted due to our recent form. We have improved.&ldquo;This is the perfect opportunity to end that winless streak. We know we have had a poor first half of the season. We have to ensure we have a much better second round. We have to get three points from the derby.&rdquo;Norodien said his confidence was sky high after scoring a stunning equaliser in the recent clash with leaders Cape Town City: &ldquo;I should have scored late in the 1-1 draw against Polokwane City (last weekend). But I&rsquo;m raring to go. This will be my second derby and it was a dream come true for me playing in my first last October, which ended 0-0. I&rsquo;m looking forward to a lot more derbies in the future.&rdquo;
