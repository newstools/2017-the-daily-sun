WHEN children wake up in this area, they often have bleeding noses! That&rsquo;s because they have to live with overflowing sewage. Night and day, their parents&rsquo; shacks are swimming in waste, forcing the families to inhale stinking air.This nightmare is part of life at the newly developed RDP area of eMahashe in Despatch, Nelson Mandela Bay.During the phase one project, 179 RDPs are being built, but residents said instead of flowing with milk and honey, their new land only has sewage!Nompumelelo Nteto (28) said only pigs enjoy living in the area. She said her four-year-old daughter Aqhama&rsquo;s nose bleeds every morning when she wakes up.&ldquo;Over 10 blocked drains surround us, making my daughter&rsquo;s nose bleed.&ldquo;She also has a runny stomach. She skips meals and alwayas cries. I often go to the clinic and when she goes to the toilet, her kak is green!&rdquo;Another parent Luthando Matyumza (35), said her daughter Agcobile (2) hasn&rsquo;t been to Masincedane pre-school yet because she&rsquo;s been sick. &ldquo;She scratches her skin, which has brown pimples. &ldquo;All this started in March, when stinking drains started to rule our land! Mosquitoes buzz in our shacks and we can&rsquo;t sleep.&ldquo;Children cough every night and you can hear your neighbour&rsquo;s kids are always awake as they cry the whole night. We feel as if we&rsquo;re being cursed.&rdquo; Ward 41 ANC Councillor Simphiwe Tyukana said: &ldquo;I have several reference numbers and I have reported the matter to the municipality for many years. This situation is unbearable.&rdquo;
