THE dead man&rsquo;s coffin had barely hit the bottom of the grave when the pastor was already poking his widow!Other congregants warned the pastor that sleeping with an uncleansed widow would cost him his life. And now the pastor&rsquo;s dead too, after his 4-5 started swelling and he died in pain! Pastor Joseph Mokaneng (55) from Christian Faith Apostolic Church in Westonaria, west of Joburg, had been having an affair with one of the widows in the congregation whose husband died last year.He wouldn&rsquo;t listen to other elders&rsquo; disapproval that he was breaking the law of Boswagadi &ndash; a traditional Tswana belief that forbids men sleeping with a recent widow who is still in mourning. His old friend Jacob Moya said the pastor&rsquo;s private parts started swelling uncontrollably and became very painful.&ldquo;He went to see doctors but no one could explain what was wrong with him.&rdquo;Church member Nomalanga Stuurman said Joseph had no relatives in Joburg and appealed to his family in Limpopo to fetch his body at the mortuary so that he can get a proper burial.&rdquo;
