MASKANDI star Mthandeni Manqele, aka &ldquo;Igcokamelisha&rdquo;, survived a fatal car accident.This when his minibus taxi collided with another car in Vryheid, in northern KZN.But it seems the crash, which left three people dead, has landed him in hot water because, according to sources, he doesn&rsquo;t have a Professional Public Driver&rsquo;s Permit (PDP) to drive the minibus taxi. A source claimed: &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have a PDP. He only has a driver&rsquo;s licence, which permits him to drive his private car only.&rdquo;But Mthandeni&rsquo;s manager, Vusi Leeuw, said Mthandeni doesn&rsquo;t need a PDP to drive his taxi.&ldquo;Mthandeni was driving his own taxi. Therefore, it&rsquo;s different from a public-transport taxi after he performed at a maskandi festival in Jozini, northern KZN, on Saturday.&ldquo;Then on Sunday, when they were driving back to Gauteng, his driver wasn&rsquo;t in a good state to drive. Mthandeni took over the steering wheel. Unfortunately, they were involved in an accident. Three people died in the other car, while he and his six band members sustained serious injuries. They were rushed to Vryheid Hospital and discharged on Monday,&rdquo; Vusi said.&ldquo;Mthandeni was still not feeling well, so we decided to put him in another hospital, which I can&rsquo;t name, for safety reasons.&rdquo;KZN Department of Transport spokesperson, Kwanele Ncalane, said: &ldquo;Anyone who drives a public-transport vehicle without a PDP is breaking the law.&rdquo; KZN police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, said: &ldquo;Hlobane police are investigating a case of culpable homicide.&rdquo; Mthandeni could not be reached for comment. Vusi said he was still in hospital.
