ILLEGAL abortions are a terrible reality in Mzansi.Everywhere you go, especially in the cities, you are greeted by posters inviting people to unsafe back door abortions . . .The has led to the launch of Fem, a new initiative by safe2choose that hopes to give all Mzansi people access to immediate and locally relevant sexual health services and information with a simple SMS platform.While Mzansi has one of the most dynamic and liberal constitutions in the world that emphasises and empowers people&rsquo;s rights to sexual identity and sexual health, it unfortunately is not always so in daily life.Phephisile Mathizerd, Fem&rsquo;s associate programme officer, said this was especially true when it came to access to abortion information and services. Research from Ipas, a global non-profit organisation that opposes unsafe abortions, found that 30% of Mzansi women are not aware that abortion is legal and about 50% of abortions are illegal and performed in unsafe environments.&ldquo;Some 18,5 million of the world&rsquo;s total of 21,6 million yearly unsafe abortions occur in developing countries like South Africa.&ldquo;Unsafe abortions have a massive impact on young women, the members of local society most impacted by poverty and unemployment. It&rsquo;s important that we bring sexual health services and information to them.&rdquo;Part of an international non-profit movement, safe2choose is a social enterprise whose mission is to provide evidence-based information and counselling on how to have a safe abortion. Fem wants to shift Mzansi sexual health attitudes by communicating with people using their cellphones. They place a strong emphasis on the speedy and efficient delivery of information. The pilot phase will take place in the Gauteng province, and the tool will gradually roll out to other provinces. The person SMSes FEM to 30816. After answering a few reply questions, they get sent a referral SMS to a nearby legal and safe abortion provider.
