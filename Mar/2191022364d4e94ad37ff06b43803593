GRADE 11 pupil Sithembiso Mungwe (16) was stabbed to death at school on Friday. It happened minutes before his late gogo&rsquo;s body arrived home for burial the following day. According to relatives and community members, Sithembiso attracted bad luck when he disrespected his customs and culture. Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said when a family is waiting for the arrival of a relative&rsquo;s corpse, the other relatives are not allowed to leave the house. &ldquo;I understand the boy was warned but didn&rsquo;t listen. He has learnt the hard way,&rdquo; said Mhlongo.Sithembiso, a pupil at Vuyiswa Mtolo Secondary School in L section, KwaMashu, north of Durban, went to school on Friday despite being advised not to. He got into a fight with a grade 8 pupil who stabbed him to death.A family member (35) said the boy&rsquo;s elders had explained to him why it was not a good idea to leave the house. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t listen and just said he would return early. That never happened. The news of his death arrived minutes after his gogo&rsquo;s body came home.&rdquo; Sithembiso&rsquo;s mum was too upset to give the SunTeam a comment.A pupil at the school said it was not clear what started the fight. &ldquo;We suspect it&rsquo;s related to the ongoing feud between boys from KwaMashu township and those from the hostel. &ldquo;The township boys allegedly undermine the hostel boys because of where they live,&rdquo; claimed the pupil.KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa condemned the incident.&ldquo;The department will visit the family to see how we can assist,&rdquo; he said.KZN cop spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of murder has been opened.She said: &ldquo;A 14-year-old suspect has been arrested and will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court today.&rdquo;
