Former Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski has voiced his support for manager Arsene Wenger, stating that the Frenchman built the club from nothing.Wenger has come under heavy fire in recent weeks, after Arsenal were eliminated from the Champions League at the last-16 phase again, before slipping out of the Premier League's top four.Podolski played under Wenger during a three-year stint at the north London outfit before moving to current club Galatasaray in 2015, and has come out in support of his former boss.The German, who made his final appearance for his national team on Wednesday, believes Wenger single-handedly built the Gunners into the club it is today, and doesn't think he can be replaced.He told&nbsp;Sky Sports: "I follow nearly every match - when not live, on social media - and I don't know what's happened."Arsene Wenger is a good guy and a good coach. He built this club from nothing to now, and it will be interesting what happens in the next months."The 31-year-old added: "I don't know who the guy is that can replace him. He is Arsenal."
