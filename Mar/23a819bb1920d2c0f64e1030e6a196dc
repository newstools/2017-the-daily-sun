COPS are on the hunt for three suspects after one of their own was shot and wounded by the alleged truck hijackers. The incident happened on Tuesday in Kagiso outside Krugersdorp, west of Joburg. Police in the area spotted a truck that had been reported stolen, and pulled it over. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said a 32-year-old constable went to inspect the truck but as he approached, gunshots were fired at the constable and he fell to the ground. &ldquo;The truck then sped off but came to a halt in the next street after it collided with a red VW Golf. The suspects abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot,&rdquo; he said. One of the men was nabbed later that day. Police are now searching for the three remaining suspects. The critically injured constable was airlifted to hospital. Makhubela said the stolen truck was recovered and cases of attempted murder and truck hijacking are being investigated.
