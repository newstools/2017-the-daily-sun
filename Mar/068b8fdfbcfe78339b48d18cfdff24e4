FANS can look forward to a Super Friday of Absa Premiership action when some of the leading title contenders are in action tonight.The big match of the night will be played at the Cape Town Stadium where joint leaders Cape Town City host defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns, who are breathing down their necks with games in hand.City and SuperSport United head the table with 35 points, while Downs are two points behind with three matches in hand over the Citizens.The Brazilians would have joined City and Matsatsantsa at the top of the table had they beaten Chippa United in their &ldquo;two-day&rdquo; match that started at Loftus Versfeld on Tuesday and continued the following day due to a power failure in the Hatfield area that evening.The match ended in a dull 0-0 draw.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;We wasted one of our games in hand by drawing with Chippa. But now we have the chance to go top for the first time this season.&rdquo;Mosimane has a healthy respect for City and head coach Eric Tinkler, who beat his side 2-1 at Loftus in the first round.City beat the Brazilians the week after they had won the Caf Champions League by beating Egyptian giants Zamalek 3-1 on aggregate.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;That was a funny situation after the Champions League when they beat us. They are one of the teams competing with us for the league title and have done well so far this season. They boast a potent attack.&rdquo;Tinkler said his players were enjoying life among the pacesetters and would be happy about Downs&rsquo; midweek draw. He said Downs could be beaten again and promised them a tough reception. Third-placed Bidvest Wits, who lost 2-0 to Downs at Loftus last weekend, host struggling Bloemfontein Celtic at Bidvest Stadium tonight in what head coach Gavin Hunt hopes will not be a banana skin for his ambitious players.Phunya Sele Sele are 13th with 18 points, only five ahead of bottom club Baroka FC, and will be fighting for their lives.Wits also have their trip to Egypt next weekend at the back of their minds, where they play Al Ahly in the first round of the Champions League in Cairo on 11 March.Chippa head coach Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela is wary of improving Platinum Stars ahead of tonight&rsquo;s other fixture at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium.Dikwena walloped Celtic 3-0 away last weekend to ease their relegation fears and said Malesela: &ldquo;We have been picking up draws lately and we need to start turning those into three points.&rdquo;All three matches kick off at 8pm.
