A strong second half display saw Bidvest Wits run out comfortable 3-1 winners against Bloemfontein Celtic at the Bidvest Stadium in the Premiership on Friday night.Thulani Hlatshwayo got Wits off to a dream start just five minutes into the game, but the sides went into the halftime break on level terms after Kabelo Mahlasela leveled the scores after half an hour.The hosts were strong in the second half and Buhle Mkhwanazi deservedly restored their lead on 63 minutes before Buhle Mkhwanazi secured the win in the 73rd minute.The Clever Boys burst out of the gates and got their just reward when Nazeer Allie flicked on a long throw for Hlatshwayo to nod home and give them an early lead in just the fifth minute.Celtic responded well and Darren Keet had to pull off a good save to deny the visitors. Mogakolodi Ngele then tried his luck from long range but Patrick Tignyemb was equal to the shot and made an easy save.The visitors then landed a hammer blow on the half hour mark when the pounced on a defensive error and Mahlasela stabbed home an easy finish into an empty net to level the scores.Wits probably should have gone into half time with the lead after Ngele wasted a couple of good chances, but they more than made up for it after the break.The home side were by far the better team in the second half and had a number of chances before Mkhwanazi timed his jump to perfection in the 63rd minute to head Wits back into the lead.They made sure the points would be theirs 10 minutes later with Klate lofted a beautiful ball into the box for Mhango to artfully guide his header past Tignyemb and make it 3-1.
