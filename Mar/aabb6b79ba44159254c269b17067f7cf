ONCE again Makhosi Khoza has received death threats. Moloto Mothapo, the Mpumalanga parliamentary spokesman, said parliament is disturbed by death threats allegedly levelled at Khoza, the chairwoman of the portfolio committee on public service and administration. &ldquo;Dr Khoza received calls in the last two days,&rdquo; said Mothapo. &ldquo;It seems there is some unhappiness with the stern views her committee made during its oversight programme.&rdquo; The calls followed the committee&rsquo;s two-day oversight visit to Mpumalanga, where a number of problems in the province&rsquo;s health services came to the committee&rsquo;s attention. This resulted in a wide range of critical views from committee members and Khoza which appeared in a statement. Mothapo said: &ldquo;Parliament does not take the alleged threats lightly and a report will be made to the Speaker of the National Assembly for the institution to determine an appropriate course of action. The alleged threatening calls will also be reported to law enforcement agencies for investigation.&rdquo; In 2011, Khoza also received death threats when she was competing for the job of eThekwini municipal manager. She was forced to withdraw to save her life. At the time, she said: &ldquo;I feel alone because no one from the ANC has called or sent me an SMS to ask about what happened.&rdquo; Daily Sun could not get hold of Khoza as her phone went unanswered and she did not respond to text messages.
