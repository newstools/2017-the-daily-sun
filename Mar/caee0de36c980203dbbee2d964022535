RECEIVING gifts, especially from neighbours, is always a good thing.But for Portia Masango (29) it turned into a nightmare.Her boyfriend allegedly became angry when she received two pairs of shoes for her kids &ndash; and he trashed her groceries as a result!In the end her maize meal and spices ended up in the toilet and on the floor &ndash; and a bag of potatoes was found on the roof.The drama happened on Saturday night when Portia&rsquo;s boyfriend came home from work to find the shoes for her daughters.After she told him she got the shoes from a neighbour, the boyfriend allegedly started swearing at her and beating her.&ldquo;He told me that our neighbour was sending muthi into our house with the shoes,&rdquo; claimed Portia. She said she managed to defend herself and got her children out of the house.&ldquo;I then asked the same neighbour to let my kids sleep over for the night while I sorted the problem out,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I went back to my house with a stick. The intention was to beat my boyfriend, but he ran away,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have opened many cases against him before, but the police do not arrest him.&ldquo;When they do, they free him after a few hours.&ldquo;On Monday I went to Rosslyn cop shop but they refused to help me. They told me that I am always at the police station every weekend. They called me &lsquo;weekend special&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said.When Daily Sun contacted the boyfriend, he said that Portia was being disrespectful. He accused her of lying and said she had a gambling problem and misused their money.&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the one who abuses me emotionally and physically,&rdquo; he said.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela said Portia should go back to Rosslyn Police Station and ask to speak to the station commander.
