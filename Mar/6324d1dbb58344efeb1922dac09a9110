HER late sangoma mum healed many patients ekasi.But now her bones and the kit she left to her daughter have been stolen by thugs, who broke into her house three times!Zanele Morudu (46) from Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My mum comes to me in my dreams and speaks about her missing bones. &ldquo;She tells me I am still protected, and those who stole her things will come to a dead end because of their behaviour.&rdquo; She said the first burglary happened last year and the latest occurred on Saturday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reported three cases to the police, but nothing happened. None of my cases were taken seriously&rdquo; she said. Zanele said during the first burglary the thugs stole her TV, sound system and other valuables. She said when the police didn&rsquo;t arrive, she went to see the people she suspected of being behind the burglary and they confessed. During the second burglary, thugs took her kids&rsquo; nappies, food from the fridge and a new TV.&ldquo;During the third burglary, they entered the room of my ancestors and took bones, muthi and other things my mum used to work with,&rdquo; she said. Zanele said those who disrespected the sangoma powers would learn the hard way. Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said Zanele&rsquo;s cases were being investigated.
