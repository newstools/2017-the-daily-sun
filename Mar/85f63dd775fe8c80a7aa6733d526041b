She left her seated on the seat and rushed back to the house to check on the curry that she had left on the stove. She said she heard screams and she rushed back to the toilet but could not see her. &ldquo;She called the neighbours and they looked for her without luck. &ldquo;Some people said they saw a strange man carrying a baby. That made us believe that my daughter had been kidnapped. But three hours later, I had a strange feeling that she had probably fallen into the pit toilet. &ldquo;I asked the cops to have a look. The toilet was drained and her body was found at the bottom.&rdquo; Frank said the family doesn&rsquo;t blame the nanny because they believe it was an honest mistake.
