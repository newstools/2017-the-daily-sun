This is because her stepsister, Refiloe Makgateng (68), has allegedly locked her up in the yard of their parents&rsquo; home because the gogo refused to leave when Refiloe tried to kick her out. The gogo from Dwaarsloop B, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun she had not been allowed out since last Saturday. Semma said the home belonged to her late mum and she had been living in it with Refiloe for as long as she could remember. &ldquo;Refiloe is planning on building new rooms to rent out,&rdquo; said the gogo. But Refiloe said gogo Semma was lying. She said the gogo used to fight with their late brother Ellios, who lived in the house until he died in 2004.&ldquo;When her marriage ended, she moved in with my brother.&ldquo;He never had peace. She also fought with Ellios&rsquo; kids over his ID and she killed some of my goats.&rdquo;Induna Simon Mkhabele said the dispute was heard at the Malele Tribal Council in September, and the court ruled that Semma must leave the site within three months. Councillor Themba Nxumalo said the municipality is planning to build an RDP for the gogo.
