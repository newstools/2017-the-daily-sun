NATIONAL Student Financial Aid Scheme beneficiaries at the Mangosuthu University of Technology in Umlazi, south of Durban, have been studying without food and book allowances for a month. Now they are threatening to shut down the university if the matter is not resolved urgently.A third-year student (25) said they were angered by the issue because it put their education at stake.&ldquo;We started attending classes last month, yet we still have not received book allowances. &ldquo;This could cause us to fail our exams at the end of the term,&rdquo; said the student.A second-year student (22) said they were frustrated by the delay.&ldquo;I live at the university&rsquo;s residence. &ldquo;Most of the time, I am forced to eat once a day.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful because I can&rsquo;t concentrate on an empty stomach,&rdquo; said the student.The students said they received SMSes last week indicating they were going to get their allowances, but that has not happened.Vezinhlanhla Simelane, president of the Student Representative Council, confirmed that some of the students had not been paid their allowances. &ldquo;Hopefully, all students will receive their allowances by the end of the week,&rdquo; he said.Bheki Hlophe, the university&rsquo;s spokesman, said the problem with the process of paying allowances was caused by the introduction of online services.&ldquo;Technical challenges emerged in the payment of allowances, but we are hopeful the matter will be dealt with as soon as possible,&rdquo; said Hlophe.NSFAS spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo said the funding scheme was not to blame for the delay. Mamabolo told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;On 16 January we made an upfront payment of R1.3 billion to all universities, including Mangosuthu University of Technology. &ldquo;This money was given to universities with the aim of paying allowances to students.&rdquo;
