ETETE residents claim that the provincial human settlements department and the KwaDukuza municipality promised to build them RDP houses in 2013. But they said they are still waiting for the promised houses. The residents gave the municipality and the department an ultimatum of two weeks to come to them with a date of when the housing project will begin.This comes after the residents took to the streets on Tuesday and Wednesday, demanding that the issue be treated urgently. Dumisani Mhlongo (33) said they were fed up with empty promises.&ldquo;The officials have made many promises before but nothing has happened yet. Now we are saying enough is enough!&rdquo;He said what made them angrier was that their councillor, Promise Dube, does not have answers, while Mayor Ricardo Mthembu seemed too busy to come and address them on the RDP issue.&ldquo;The last time we saw Mthembu was before the middle of last year when he came with contractors who dug up foundations and left. Since then he has never told us why they stopped,&rdquo; he said.Daily Sun tried to call councillor Dube several times, but her phone was off.Municipality spokesman Sphephelo Ngobese said the Etete housing project had only reached stage one, which was planning approval. &ldquo;The municipality has submitted the stage two applications to KZN human settlements for funding. Funding of the construction has not been approved.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said there were no arrests during the protest.Human settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said: &ldquo;We are aware that the housing project in Etete was stopped. &ldquo;This came after we concluded that the KwaDukuza and Ilembe dictrict municipalities had to start with a water project first before the housing project could be commenced.&rdquo;
