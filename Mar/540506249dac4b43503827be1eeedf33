THESE residents are furious because the toilets in their area are locked, preventing community members from using them. The people of Diepsloot, northern Joburg told Daily Sun the toilets were built three years ago. Resident John Baloyi (53) said: &ldquo;Why are they doing this to us? We are treated like animals because we live in squatter camps. &ldquo;The toilets are right in front of us, but they&rsquo;re locked and guarded. It&rsquo;s sad that there are people still living without toilets in South Africa. This is supposed to be a democracy. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s sad is that our own brothers are treating us like this. The way we are living is worse than during apartheid.&rdquo; Residents said they had to walk 4km to relieve themselves. Councillor Kate Mbhahlele said: &ldquo;We have raised the issue with Joburg Water, which is responsible for the toilets. The toilets are not all complete, which is why they&rsquo;re still locked.&ldquo;We are waiting for all of them to be finished before we hand them over to residents. We are pleading with the community to be patient with us.&rdquo; A meeting has been scheduled with Joburg Water and the councillor on Friday to find a solution to the problem.
