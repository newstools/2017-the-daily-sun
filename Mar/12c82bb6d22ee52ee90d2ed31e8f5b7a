GAUTENG Jaguar vice captain, Tshinakaho Mdau, has emphasised the importance of consistency to ensure the Brutal Fruit Netball Premier League title doesn&rsquo;t slip through their fingers for the fourth time in a row.The wing attack witnessed when her side lost their third consecutive final (54-43) to Free State Cheetahs at Olive Centre, in Durban, KZN, in May last year.She told SunSport they have rectified their mistakes and are not prepared to falter again.The league will take place in Cape Town, Durban and Bloemfontein starting from 21 April to 11 June. The Jaguars will start their campaign on 22 April against Free State outfit Crinums.Said Mdau: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been part of this for three unfortunate years.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disappointing to play in the final and have the same result repeatedly against the same team.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still hard when I think of it, but having lost three times doesn&rsquo;t mean we played badly. We&rsquo;ll ensure consistency in our performance this time, and hopefully, we&rsquo;ll have a different outcome this year.&rdquo;Mdau, who is studying for a Bcom Agricultural Economics degree at the University of Pretoria, reckons new recruits like Shongile Hlungwana, Chante Louw and Chrisna Bootha will add the much-needed stability in their bid to wrestle the title from Cheetahs.She went on: &ldquo;We encourage our youngsters to be unique and bring their experience from high school.&ldquo;That will teach them to grow a lot quicker to play on this level.&ldquo;They fit in so well to our set-up and look up to us, which makes it easy for the team to gel.&rdquo;But the 23-year-old is aware the tactical approach of coach Jenny van Dyk will be vital to achieve their goal.&ldquo;We were in a routine in the previous years. But this year it&rsquo;s a totally different aspect, in the sense that if anything happens, how we react to it will be important.&ldquo;She has prepared us to ensure every individual is able to handle any situation we come across.&rdquo;Mdau revealed that it won&rsquo;t be easy to focus on her studies while playing in three provinces.&ldquo;Travelling will be hard as the majority of us are students. This means missing classes.&ldquo;Not having home ground advantage will also make things difficult, but we have to learn to adapt to the situation.&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a huge challenge, but we&rsquo;re up for it.&rdquo;
