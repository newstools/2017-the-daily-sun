&ldquo;WHEN the money you&rsquo;ve worked for is paid into your account, a feeling of satisfaction flows through your veins.&rdquo; These were the words of Bonginkosi Maphalala, who works at Isomi Poultry in section A, KwaMashu, north of Durban. The 40-year-old sells chicken for a living.&ldquo;I leave home early in the morning and return late at night, but I enjoy what I do. At least I am not a criminal,&rdquo; said Bonginkosi.He said residents have been supporting the business ever since he started working there two years ago. &ldquo;I never go home empty-handed. Residents buy chickens every day, especially at the weekend because that&rsquo;s when a lot of people host ceremonies for their ancestors.&rdquo; Bongikosi said the business attracts a lot of customers during the school holidays as well as the festive season.&ldquo;Some people still believe in slaughtering chickens for their kids when they pass at the end of a school term. &ldquo;Others like to slaughter chickens when relatives visit them during the holidays.&rdquo; Bongikosi said he is thankful to Chris Msomi, his boss, for the generosity he has shown him ever since he hired him&ldquo;He is one of a kind. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to stop working for him. He is down to earth and has a lot of good ideas which help the business.&rdquo;
