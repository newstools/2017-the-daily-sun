EFF leader Julius Malema outlined his party&rsquo;s strategies to rescue South Africa from crisis and get rid of President Jacob Zuma.Speaking at a press conference in Braamfontein in the wake of the Cabinet reshuffle just past midnight this morning, Malema said his party would be asking Parliament&rsquo;s speaker, Baleka Mbete for a special seating of Parliament where a vote of no confidence against Zuma would be held.Malema said that &ldquo;unity of purpose&rdquo; is what is needed between opposition parties and those in the ANC distressed by the direction the ruling party is taking to get rid of Zuma. The vote of no confidence would need the support of 70 ANC MPs and all opposition MPs&rsquo; votes to succeed.&ldquo;If all those in the opposition and ANC act in the best interests of the country, Zuma is gone,&rdquo; said Malema.Malema didn&rsquo;t mince his words about the new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba, who replaces Pravin Gordhan. &ldquo;Malusi is corrupt to the core. There are serious allegations against Malusi for having a foreign off-shore account and having huge amounts of money he exchanged with his friends [the Guptas].&rdquo;He claimed that Gigaba&rsquo;s extravagant lifestyle gives his corruption away, and that he stays in a house in Cape Town bought for him by the Guptas.Malema said that, by putting Gigaba in that position, &ldquo;they have taken Treasury and placed it at the gate of Saxonwold shebeen&rdquo;. Malema also lashed Fikile Mbalula, who is the new Minister of Police, saying that he thought of himself as a celebrity and &ldquo;the Minister of Twitter&rdquo;, which was inappropriate for a senior civil servant.Among the ANC&rsquo;s top six, Malema referred to Gwede Mantashe as &ldquo;a coward who contradicts himself. He&rsquo;s an unreliable force. Jessie [Duarte] is captured [by the Guptas]&rdquo;.He also said that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa&rsquo;s outspoken objection to the axing of Gordhan was pointed to how divided the ANC is.&ldquo;The centre is not holding. When we say the ANC is dead, we mean exactly that,&rdquo; said Malema.He also criticised those who voted for the ANC. &ldquo;Voters also have a responsibility to rescue the country. ANC voters must be very proud today of the mess they&rsquo;ve got us in.&rdquo;
