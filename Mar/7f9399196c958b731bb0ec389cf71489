However, on most days he is likely to still be on the road by 9am. Sifiso is one of many Sikhumbuzo and Siyaphambili pupils from kasis such as Walkerville, Grasmere, Mtanami, Vagfontein and Majazana who are forced to walk and hitchhike to school due to transport issues.He said: “It’s not easy for us to catch taxis from Grasmere straight to Orange Farm so we are forced to hike.“This affects our learning big time as we are late almost daily and we are also exhausted from the endless walking.” Sifiso said what makes matters worse is that the school is not sympathetic. “When we get to school sometimes it is in the middle of the second period and are told to wait outside for the next period.”Another pupil, Tshepo Mokoena (20), believes the only way for this matter to be resolved is for government to provide transport.“Before we could take short cuts through the field but we were mugged by thugs so we have to hitchhike around it. It is a risky business, especially for girls.”Oupa Bodibe, spokesman for the Gauteng Department of Education, said the department is aware of the situation but there is nothing it can do. “Siyaphambili and Sikhumbuzo are independent schools and government does not provide transport for them.”He said the department encourages parents to send their children to government schools closer to their areas of residence. “As a department, we can provide parents with information of schools nearer to their homes and further assist in getting them placements there,” Bodibe said.
