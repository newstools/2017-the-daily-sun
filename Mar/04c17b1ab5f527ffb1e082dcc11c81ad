SOUTH African Under-20 coach Thabo Senong was impressed with his boys&rsquo; performance against Zambia in the semifinal of the Africa Youth Cup of Nations (Youth Afcon) despite losing.Zambia eliminated Amajita 1-0 to progress to the final at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka on Wednesday.This was the third time Zambia got the better of Amajita in the space of four months. They defeated Amajita 2-1 to win the Cosafa Cup final in the North West in December and repeated that scoreline when they beat Amajita in a friendly game in Lusaka last month. The big positive is that this year&rsquo;s Amajita team improved on their 2015 performance at the Under-20 Afcon by winning two games and making it to the semifinals. This enabled them to qualify for the South Korea Under-20 World Cup from 20 May to 11 June. The young stars gave it their all at the tournament and if they can build on this as they prepare for the World Cup, they could make an impact in South Korea.Amajita will meet the loser of the match between Senegal and Guinea for the third and fourth place play-offs at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka on Sunday.&ldquo;We have to keep improving but I must say there has been progress. I&rsquo;m very proud of the Amajita team. Now every game is preparation for the World Cup. &ldquo;I believe with more time, more camps we should have enough time to prepare properly for the World Cup.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate we were knocked out but we will go back to the drawing board and will fight for third place,&rdquo; said Senong.
