THEY WAIT at pay points for the gogos to come for their pension money.&nbsp; Claiming to be nyangas, they offer advice and muthi.&nbsp; BUT&thinsp;&thinsp;THEY&thinsp;&thinsp;ARE&thinsp;&thinsp;HEARTLESS THIEVES OUT TO ROB THE DEFENCELESS. Throughout the country, gogos run a terrifying gauntlet of people wanting to take the little bit of pension money they receive once a month. Mashonisas, insurance scammers and now even fake inyangas are lying in wait for old ladies. Operating behind the Naledi police station in Soweto, the six men were selling muthi to pensioners and even doing consultations in their cars. But their luck ran out on Wednesday, when they were caught red-handed doing &ldquo;consultations&rdquo;. Gogo Amanda Masilo (91) said one of the men approached her and told her she was suffering from arthritis and that she needed help. &ldquo;They gave me something to inhale which made me sneeze all the way home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My daughter panicked and took R500 to the men because she thought I would die. &ldquo;My daughter doesn&rsquo;t work. That money was meant to buy meat for the entire month.&rdquo; The SunTeam photographed one of the men consulting with gogo Aleta Mokgotsi (81) in the front seat of a car. As the man jumped out of the car, Aleta told the SunTeam he told her she had a problem with her knees and they were always aching. &ldquo;When I agreed, they told me they were going to make all my sufferings disappear if I paid them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I almost gave those people all the money I use to feed my grandchildren.&rdquo; She said she was about to swallow the muthi when cops who came with the Commission for the Protection of Cultural and Religious rights arrived. &ldquo;Before I knew it, there were cops all over the place and they pounced on the men selling the muthi,&rdquo; she said. The six men admitted to the police they were not sangomas, but said they knew how to use muthi.&nbsp; They said they travelled all over Soweto on grant payout days to help old people. A member of the rights council, Mntimande Ngwenya, told Daily Sun he went with his mother to collect her grant money at Naledi &shy;Hall in Soweto when he was approached by a man who told him that he had serious problems in his relationship. Mntimande said he was taken to a taxi where he was told that his 4-5 was not very strong.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man was smelling of alcohol. He gave me muthi to swallow and told me I could get a more effective remedy for R700.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mntimande refused and paid only R20 and they said he owed them money and they took his phone number. &ldquo;I watched them for most of the day and saw a gogo being cut with a razor.&nbsp; &ldquo;She walked away terrified by the men. She said they told her she had to pay R700 or she would die,&rdquo; said Mntimande. When members of the public complained to the rights commission, they went to the police who then decided to surprise the thieves. Lieutenant-Colonel Solly Raphadu confirmed six men were arrested on charges of fraud as they had misrepresented themselves as sangomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do not even have certificates that show they work with muthi,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He said the suspects will appear in court soon.&nbsp;
