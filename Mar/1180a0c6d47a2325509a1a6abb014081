COPS and Home Affairs officials arrested on Wednesday will apply for bail on Thursday. The 10 cops and three officials were bust after allegedly taking bribes from people entering Mzansi at the Ficksburg border post between the Free State and Lesotho.&nbsp; The suspects appeared in the Ficksburg Magistrates Court yesterday. Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda of the Hawks told Daily Sun the case against the nine constables, one sergeant and three Home Affairs&nbsp;officials was postponed for a bail application. Hawks national head, Lieutenant-General Mthandazo Ntlemeza, said: &ldquo;The Hawks will end corruption at the borders but to do so we need co-operation from all other law enforcement agencies and the public at large. &ldquo;The suspects, some of who were arrested while on duty, allegedly demanded payment of between R150 and R200 from undercover cops posing as foreigners.&rdquo; The arrests were made through a sting operation by the Hawks and crime intelligence. It&rsquo;s alleged the officials were involved in the fraudulent endorsement of expired passport and travel documents. Netshiunda said the suspects would face charges of fraud, corruption and going against the Immigration Act. &ldquo;A search of the house of an off-duty policemen from Meqheleng, near Ficksburg led the Hawks to the discovery of over R24 000 in cash and 17 watches which cost over R100 000 each,&rdquo; he said. Speaking about the arrested Home Affairs officials, Free State spokesman Bonakele Mayekiso said: &ldquo;We will open an internal case and suspend the suspects. We will make sure we curb corruption.&rdquo;
