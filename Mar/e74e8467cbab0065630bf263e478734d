RUTENDO Nyahora is anticipating a tough Spar Women&rsquo;s 10km Challenge this year.Nyahora said the fact that the Grand Prix was now open to all runners regardless of nationality, would bring in more competition. The Zimbabwean said she hoped to finish in the top five in all the Challenges this year, starting with the Cape Town leg of the competition on Sunday. The starter&rsquo;s pistol will go off at 7.30am as the first race starts at the Green Point Common Fields of Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. Port Elizabeth, Durban, Pretoria, Pietermaritzburg and Joburg host the other five races. The new-look Grand Prix offers athletes like Nyahora a chance to walk off with the R173 000 in prize money, which was previously only on offer to South African runners. Said Nyahora: &ldquo;I am happy the Grand Prix competition is open to everyone now. The race will become more competitive because Ethiopians and Kenyans will also take part. But this can also benefit us because we will try to improve our times. &ldquo;When we compete overseas, it&rsquo;s about our times, not the position we finish in.&rdquo;She said she would have to work hard to keep a podium position in all the races. Nyahora expressed the hope that top athletes such as Mapaseka Makhanya, Lebogang Phalula, Christine Kalmer and last year&rsquo;s Grand Prix winner, Irvette van Zyl, would take part in the first Challenge in Cape Town.&ldquo;I hope to be in the top three. I will have to train harder and push myself this year. &ldquo;If the top runners take part, then we will know how to pace ourselves in the races ahead,&rdquo; she said.
