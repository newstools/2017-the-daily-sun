CYRIL Ramaphosa and the whole cabinet are responsible for the Sassa saga, alongside Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. That&rsquo;s what Zwelinzima Vavi, convener of the steering committee for a new trade union federation, said in Joburg yesterday. He claimed the elite had been ignoring the Sassa issue for two years. &ldquo;What a crime! They knew about the Constitutional Court ruling. We have an issue with the entire cabinet. &ldquo;They have been sitting there, doing nothing,&rdquo; he said. Vavi implied that Deputy President Ramaphosa could not be trusted to become president, because many of the ANC&rsquo;s mess happened under his nose. He also demanded the resignation of President Jacob Zuma. Vavi held a media conference to announce that the federation&rsquo;s founding congress would take place between 21 and 23 April at Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni. It will be attended by 1 800 delegates from 21 unions, representing over 600 000 members. &ldquo;Our aim is to reach out to more unions. About 76% of workers don&rsquo;t belong to unions. We want to reach them,&rdquo; said Vavi. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t blame them, as unions have not been useful to workers. &ldquo;We are campaigning to bring trust back to unions.&rdquo;
