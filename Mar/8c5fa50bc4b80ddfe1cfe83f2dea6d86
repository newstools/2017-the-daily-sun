THE ANC Youth League made it clear yesterday that they will support Andile Lungisa staying in office until his term ends.Lungisa was recently elected chairman of the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay, two years after the regional structure of the Youth League was disbanded.However, the ANC NEC has called for his resignation, saying it goes against the party s constitution for a member of the provincial executive committee to take up a leadership role in a regional structure.The call was echoed by ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane, who said on Monday Lungisa had to resign by Thursday or possibly face disciplinary action.He said the constitution of the ANC prohibits its leaders from holding leadership positions on two or more of its structures as this can create a conflict of interest with those who are supposed to supervise others.However, speaking at a press conference at the ANC regional head office in Port Elizabeth, ANC regional task team co-ordinator Luyolo Nqakula said Lungisa is worthy of fulfilling the responsibility he has been entrusted with. It is our view he must not undermine the will of the majority of branches by resigning. His resignation must be a directive directly from the executive of the NEC.
