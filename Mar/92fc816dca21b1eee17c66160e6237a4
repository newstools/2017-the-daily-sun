DEPUTY President Cyril Ramaphosa has rubbished claims made by the ANC Youth League that he’s still conducting business deals. Answering questions in parliament yesterday, he said he was talking to the league over the lies they had spread. “I said clearly that I didn’t leave business to come and conduct fraudulent business in government. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstmLmyT2wTPQzddP0G7E0_Tf7mOXkP_zfyXpSGI8qRtkqnYodTMdzRI_Xzkx2Y7QI7RIjrW43X5xaLZIAMsVG7PAKJO8p_B5tS8Rb8QBVgY9vTZZHgPZt7v4GDVh-LQZ8gwm3L095TCCKZriNHlVko9lUU5IXKMnmQs9R9bWZ5d-BkESXcRxUrs5n23mhDQWj4vlrAzV-7jKTc9xJKRfb2G5HQQTrl6Lgc2xSVE7wDFJPB3HRDtV7Azda8etZ-W5jDRs2i8wgbWQf7Q_Iog6fPzMjwbhWQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPbtYCEvDCNVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Do not make money through government dealings. There is no truth to the rumour that I’m conducting business with State-owned enterprises.” Ramaphosa defended ANC MPs who rejected an EFF motion to change the Constitution to speed up land reform. He said land is a central issue but the matter is being dealt with by the governing party, which respects the rule of law. He said although recent attacks on foreigners were unfortunate, he agreed with President Jacob Zuma that South Africans don’t hate foreigners. “This is their home as much as it is our home.”
