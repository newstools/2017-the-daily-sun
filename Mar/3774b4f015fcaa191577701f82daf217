THIS year seems to be racing away and that can&rsquo;t be a bad thing &ndash; as we gear ourselves for DJ Mahoota&rsquo;s 4th Annual SA Music Carnival, to be held at Sandton&rsquo;s nightspot Taboo night club on 17 March.Be warned, this is no ordinary club event. Expect over 60 live acts and DJs to dazzle the crowds on three dance floors in an electrifying carnival atmosphere.Like last year, there will be a R30&thinsp;000 cash prize to be won by the person deemed to be wearing the best outfit by a panel of judges.The three genres of house music, hip hop and kwaito will form the foundation for the entire event.All will be well-represented by a combination of live performances and Mzansi&rsquo;s famous DJs.The expensive music industry will be headed by the legends Vinny da Vinci, Christos, Oskido and Ganyani, with a solid line-up behind them.The list includes Glenzito, Lulo Caf&eacute;, Tira, Shimza, Heavy K and Fistaz. Live acts by Black Motion, Busiswa, Nokwazi as well as Dr Malinga are on the bill.The continued rise of hip hop will be spearheaded by Kwesta, Nasty C, Riky Rik, A-Reece, Sjava and Maraza with the decks competently handled by Sphectacula and Naves, Speedsta, Citilyts and a long list of others.A great aspect of the show will be strong kwaito representation by Professor, Spikiri, Mdu, Arthur and a host of greats.As the show prides itself in being a promoter of tourism to Gauteng, especially from our SADC neighbours, there will be performances by Afro Warriors of Angola and DJ Kalpso from Namibia.&nbsp;This segment of the show is expected to grow at future events.Partners for the event are DStv channels Mzansi Magic and Channel O, urban radio station Y-FM and brands Johnny Walker Platinum, Ciroc and Heineken.Tickets for the event are available at Computicket. Early birds&rsquo; specials until late February cost R200. Then, the normal pricing of R250 kicks in &ndash; with gate tickets starting at R300 before 10pm. The show looks set to be a sell out. So, book early to avoid disappointment. The best part to this music carnival, is you stand a chance to win a brand new car!&nbsp;
