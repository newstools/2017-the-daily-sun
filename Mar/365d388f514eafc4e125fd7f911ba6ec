NINE people died in three separate fires in Cape Town townships over the weekend.&nbsp; Speaking about a fire in Mandela Park near Hout Bay on Friday, Western Cape social development MEC Albert Fritz said: &ldquo;This is one of the worst fire incidents this year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fire killed two people and it is estimated it destroyed over 1&thinsp;000 structures, leaving nearly 4&thinsp;000 people homeless.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are appealing to the public to assist by helping with things such as clothing, water, food, accommodation and personal hygiene items.&nbsp; &ldquo;Social workers and social relief officials are on the ground providing counselling and co-ordinating relief services with the Red Cross,&rdquo; said Fritz.&nbsp; Meanwhile in Philippi, Simbongile Gxabha (33), her son Simbonile (11) and her boyfriend, whose name was only given as Isaac (33), were killed when a jealous former boyfriend allegedly threw a petrol bomb into their shack.&nbsp; Neighbours told Daily Sun they heard Simbongile crying for help.&nbsp; &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t escape as she was trapped behind a closed burglar door and the fire was too fierce to save her,&rdquo; said one resident.&nbsp; In Kuils River two adults and two children died when three shacks burned down. The cause of the fire was unknown.&nbsp; Meanwhile, sponsors of the Cape Town Cycle Tour, which had to be cancelled yesterday due to heavy winds, have decided to donate food and drinks meant for the race to victims of the Hout Bay fire. Pick n Pay, Coke and Powerade said all food and drinks shipped in for the race would be delivered to the victims.
