Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler says they are not thinking about the possibility of securing a historic treble in their debut season in the Premiership.The Citizens have the opportunity to secure their second trophy this season ahead of facing ABC Motsepe League outfit Acornbush United in the Nedbank Cup last 32 on Sunday.When asked about his thoughts regarding City achieving a historic treble in their first season, Tinkler subtly dismissed the suggestion, saying that they take each game as it comes."We just think game by game and it's no different now," he said in post-match comments.&nbsp;"Our objective is to move onto the next round of the cup. We've tasted success in a cup competition and we would like to continue doing that.&nbsp;"It's all about putting in the right amount of effort in - doing it game by game. That's what important. The focus now has to be on Acornbush.&nbsp;"We know how easy it can be to become complacent following that result against Sundowns. We saw it. It happened to us, here at home against Platinum Stars immediately after lifting the cup. We don't want that to happen to us, hopefully we would've learnt from that experience," he said.City suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat at the hands of Dikwena after defeating SuperSport United to claim the Telkom Knockout trophy.&nbsp;
