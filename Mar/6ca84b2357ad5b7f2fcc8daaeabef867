Orlando Pirates assistant coach Harold 'Jazzy Queen' Legodi has explained he is satisfied with the start made under coach Kjell Jonevret, and remains passionate about youth development.Legodi was appointed to work under Jonevret alongside former Bucs star Benson Mhlongo, and the side from Mayfair have remained unbeaten in their opening weeks together.He told the club's official website, "Overall though the experience has been good, the players have been responding well. The unfortunate part of it is that we drew three games but at least we got our first win in the Nedbank Cup and a good one at that, so hopefully going forward we will start playing well.'Jazzy Queen' added about his passion for bringing through young talent, "The club has invested so much money in its youth development program. It then becomes incumbent upon us as coaches to promote these players and hopefully it&rsquo;s not only Yusuf (Maart) but many more players will come through the ranks.&rdquo;&nbsp;
