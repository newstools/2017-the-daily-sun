HUNDREDS of truck drivers contracted to Eskom drove to the Union Buildings yesterday morning to hand over a memorandum of grievances. The drivers blocked the main roads leading into Tshwane, making it difficult for motorists to enter or leave the city. Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba, Tshwane’s Metro Police spokesman, said an application was made for the protest but it was rejected. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssVIl_YUvIJH1Xe_KwRcrgx349w-Bwf8ewhak1_H_F0szBiCOGiVzpEkj-dnUs9AH6_SQwKO3AYJnlk17-ySL23HOeEXqaa5eS-j7Z7jjBZQ5tId4WfB6UZfJa1Pa4LZtIHNCufKromtATz9ZUAHv8XgovAz5uEduSmdlbIA0UYsmEVktpTZbcBHm-pykMmvVLsdv7Ajvp7-5sXiMqjhMcDjnPYw00UrddK6j--e3EgQrePmlHfDGR4QS5RmNswG9aeQ03ILWdP-LcNSXPpc4ovL_c8J_Y\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJsv0Y4I-bLgEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Mary Phadi, spokeswoman for the Coal Transporters Forum, said: “Around a million jobs will be lost at Eskom and associated suppliers. The renewable energy agreement must be slowed down to reflect the current electricity surplus.” Shimmy Mashigo from the presidency accepted the memorandum and promised to pass it on to his bosses, who will respond within 14 working days.
