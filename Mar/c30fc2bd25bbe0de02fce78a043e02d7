Afro-soul singer Nathi and his band were robbed off their valuables at gun point in the early hours of this morning. They had just landed from Gabon where they were performing as part of a Department of Arts and Culture delegation.&nbsp; According to a source it seems like Nathi and his band were robbed by the notorious syndicate that follows unsuspecting people from O.R Tambo.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nathi and his band were driving to Auckland Park and they had to drop the keyboard player at the Milpark Flats when the robbers who seemed to have been driving behind then struck. They got out of a huge BMW X 5 currying guns and they instructed everyone in the car to hand over their valuables,&rsquo; said our source.&nbsp; The source said after realising that one of the people that they had just robbed was Nathi of Nomvula fame, they decided to give it back to him.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is so annoying and inconveniencing. Can you imagine that you have just come back from a foreign country were you were treated like royalty and you get robbed in your own country as soon as you land? Said the mole.&nbsp; Delphine Klassen of Muthaland Records confirmed that they were robbed off their valuables.&nbsp; "Those people looked like professionals because they even wiped off their finger prints from the kombi after taking our bags and cellphones. I'm traumatised about the whole thing and will go later on to open a case. We have only managed to block or credit and bank cards"&nbsp;
