THE SACP confirmed that President Jacob Zuma had informed them that a Cabinet reshuffle would see Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas booted out.This is one of the bombshells dropped by SACP Deputy General-Secretary Solly Mapaila at a media briefing this morning."The president informed us of his intention to effect a Cabinet reshuffle, replacing both minister and deputy minister of finance,&rdquo; he said.Mapaila said the SACP objected.He also lashed Zuma for his insistence that it was his &ldquo;presidential prerogative&rdquo; to appoint and dismiss ministers without giving sound reasons.Mapaila says treasury must be handled with care. "We can't allow the parasites and vultures to encircle it," he warned, saying the country was witnessing &ldquo;corruption on steroids&rdquo;.Mapaila also expressed disgust at the constant use of so-called &ldquo;intelligence reports&rdquo; to spread misinformation.This was in reference to an &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; report called Operation Checkmate. &nbsp;The report was recently and anonymously sent to media houses and political organisations. The report claimed that Gordhan and Jonas had actually been meeting with supporters in the UK and the US to plot Zuma&rsquo;s downfall. This was the reason they were so abruptly told to come home.Mapaila said the SACP had also received another &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; report that they would be circulating to the public soon.This, said Mapaila, was a repeat of a strategy being used by a &ldquo;rogue element&rdquo; in state security structures. &ldquo;A rogue intelligence unit can't be used to distort and divide the movement,&rdquo; said Mapaila.He also slammed the misuse of state organs and resources while there are so many burning issues that need attending to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
