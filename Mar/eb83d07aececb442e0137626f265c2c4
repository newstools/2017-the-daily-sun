THE long-raging battle over the eight missing square metres of their RDPs is far from over. Gatvol residents from Red Location kasi in Port Elizabeth have closed Red Location Museum since October 2013, demanding proper RDP houses. The people demanded that authorities rectify their existing 48sqm houses, but the metro refused and told them it would have to demolish and rebuild the RDPs, but at only 40sqm. By 2016 residents had become divided, with some accepting the 40sqm RDPs while others stuck to their guns as the metro sent in contractors to start the demolition and rebuild project. Gogo Mimi Foster (65) was one of the residents who decided to accept the smaller RDP, but she told Daily Sun she now regrets her decision. That is because in her case she not only got the tiny house, but all her water pipes were left exposed inside and out. And to add insult to injury, the toilet has not flushed properly since the day she moved in. She said she cursed the day she was saddled with the amateur contractor&rsquo;s mess. She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The plumber told me he would come and fix the toilet. I called the main contractor and a woman representative told me the young contractor had made a mess of my pipes and that they would come and fix them. &ldquo;She never came back. My RDP is the only one that has naked pipes. All my neighbours&rsquo; pipes are hidden inside their walls and work properly as they were serviced by professional plumbers. My tap is also constantly leaking.&rdquo; Lwandile Sicwetsha, provincial human settlements department spokesman, said gogo Mimi should report the matter to the metro so that they can deal with the problem.
