ALL that Jeremiah Mokoena (44) wanted to know from the councillor on the podium was why only a few selected residential blocks were fixed and others left unattended. But the answer Jeremiah got wasn&rsquo;t the kind he expected.He claims that after the community meeting at Slovo Park near Dennilton in Limpopo on Saturday, the councillor and her children showed up at his house and beat him with a sjambok!Apparently, Councillor Amelia Mphela was speaking to residents about RDP houses and how the municipality planned to help residents after a storm damaged their houses.&ldquo;I asked her why the municipality was only doing repairs in the block where she lives and not in other areas,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Instead of giving me an answer, she accused me of disruptive behaviour.&rdquo;Jeremiah claims that he asked Mphela more questions about RDPs allegedly being given to the councillor&rsquo;s friends, and others that were rented out while their rightful owners lived in shacks.&ldquo;After the meeting she came to my house and insulted me. She threatened to hire people to kill me. I ignored her and she left,&rdquo; Jeremiah said. Later, he found the councillor and her two sons waiting for him. Jeremiah claims he was sjamboked and beaten up.Mphela refused to comment. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the councillor appeared in court on Monday, facing assault charges, and will appear again today.
