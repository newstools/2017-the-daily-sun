THE cops showed up at the school on Monday, rounded up all the pupils, and searched their bags. With the teachers looking on, the cops started confiscating illegal items such as dagga and alcohol. But when the cops and teachers allegedly started taking the kids&rsquo; cellphones, all hell broke loose. The pupils went crazy!The angry kids started destroying desks and overturning rubbish bins at Ekangala Comprehensive High School in Tshwane.One of the pupils said they didn&rsquo;t mind when the police took their alcohol and frisked them for drugs.The pupil said: &ldquo;They crossed the line when they took our cellphones. &ldquo;We use them to do research for schoolwork and to communicate with our families.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t use them in class.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Constable Connie Moganedi told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the situation was under control when police searched the first group of pupils.&ldquo;The trouble began when the police found things that were not supposed to be on the school premises. The pupils started to complain,&rdquo; she said.She said police found alcohol, a small pack of dagga, and screwdrivers.Moganedi said police were under orders to confiscate these, but didn&rsquo;t anticipate the reaction from the pupils.&ldquo;Some even refused to be searched and teachers had to intervene.&rdquo; She said police didn&rsquo;t take the pupils&rsquo; cellphones, but added that teachers did that as part of the school&rsquo;s policy.She said despite the chaos that the pupils had caused, police were able to finish the search.At the time of going to print, the Department of Education had not responded to Daily Sun.
