THE board of Prasa has repeated its claim that it has never taken a resolution on the R5,9 million salary package of former Prasa CEO Collins Letsoale.After a shaky start to the briefing at the portfolio committee on transport today, Prasa board member Tefetso Phitsane told MPs a CEO&rsquo;s salary needs to be approved by the board.&nbsp;&ldquo;Has the board taken a resolution on his salary package? No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Phitsane said.Letsoalo had previously insisted that he inquired what salary he was entitled to and was sent the remuneration package of former axed CEO Lucky Montana.Phitsane, however, disputed Letsoalo&rsquo;s claim, saying that Montana&rsquo;s salary package had been &ldquo;an issue&rdquo; raised in former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report on irregularities at Prasa.&ldquo;The salary that was used for Montana was a questionable one,&rdquo; Phitsane said.He added that Letsoalo had never sat down with the board to discuss his salary package.&nbsp;&ldquo;He refused to sit down with us to finalise the salary issue. We referred the matter to the Minister (of Transport Dipuo Peters) who said she&rsquo;d investigate the matter. She never did. I personally said I won&rsquo;t entertain it and I left it there.&rdquo;Only later the Prasa board became aware of a memorandum, saying that the Board had agreed to pay Letsoale R5,986 million per annum, Phitsane said.&ldquo;And then I said there&rsquo;s no such resolution.&rdquo; Peters was not at the briefing. Manny de Freitas, DA MP and member of the portfolio committee on transport said it was concerning that Minister Peters was not attending the meeting."She excused herself yesterday, saying she was ill, but yet she attended the plenary in the National Assembly in the afternoon," De Freitas said. "The minister is an integral part of this whole thing. This committee has been lied to by the minister. She needs to explain why she&rsquo;s not here today."http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/axed-ceo-letsoalo-refused-to-discuss-pay-prasa-board-member-20170308
