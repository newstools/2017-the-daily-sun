CONVICTED killer Ronald Buyani wants the state to hire him a personal chef or allow him to cook his own meals. The Barberton Medium B Prison inmate, who is serving a life sentence, said he does not eat steamed food because he is diabetic and is also on ARV treatment and suffers from ulcers.According to the 42-year-old, doctors had prescribed a special diet for him that needs to be cooked by a professional chef. Ronald is doing time after he was convicted of killing a security guard in an armed robbery in Durban in 2005.He said all was well when he was at Durban Westville Prison, but his privileges were taken away when he was transferred to the Mpumalanga jail in 2013.&ldquo;In Durban I was given high-fibre food for breakfast and I cooked my own lunch and supper. I was given raw meat, chicken or fish as well as an assortment of veggies, eggs and soya beans to cook.&rdquo;Ronald said Barberton prison officials say there is nothing special about him. &ldquo;I was told to queue for food with other inmates, or starve to death. I want my privileges back fast. My life depends on it.&rdquo; Correctional Services spokeswoman Tsidi Mapole said: &ldquo;The offender demands to be given unprepared food to cook for himself. This is not permitted. Food in our kitchen is prepared by a professional cook assisted by officials and a few selected inmates.&rdquo;
