HE HAD hoped his son was somewhere with his friends and would soon return home.But when time went by with no sign of the young man, Scelo Khoza from Ntuzuma, north of Durban, began to worry.The 42-year-old dad told Daily Sun his son, Lindani Mdlalose (21) left home to visit his friends in KwaMancinza last Monday afternoon, but he never came back home &ndash; and Scelo got the news of his death on Saturday.When Lindani did not come home on Monday night, Scelo first thought he would arrive back very early next morning. &ldquo;I noticed that he had not returned home when it was starting to get late on Monday,&rdquo; said Scelo. &ldquo;I tried to call him on his phone, but it was off. On Tuesday I went to his bedroom to check if he had come back home, but there was no sign of him. &ldquo;I started asking around, but no one had seen him. I reported the matter to the police only on Wednesday afternoon,&rdquo; he said.He had hoped that his son would return home safely, but that was not to be. &ldquo;I was shocked when I was called on Saturday to come and identify the body of an unknown man at the Phoenix mortuary. &ldquo;On my way to the mortuary I was hoping the body would not be that of Lindani, but when I got there I was shocked to see that it was indeed my son. He had a gunshot wound in his head,&rdquo; said Scelo.He said his son had no enemies. &ldquo;As far as I know, my son never spoke about anyone wanting to kill him, or mentioned he had grudges with anyone,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I hope the cops arrest the person who killed my son. Lindani had a bright future and now it has been taken away from him.&rdquo;A spokeswoman for the KZN police, Captain Nqobile Gwala, confirmed the incident and said the cops were investigating a case of murder. &ldquo;No arrests have been made at this stage,&rdquo; said Gwala.
