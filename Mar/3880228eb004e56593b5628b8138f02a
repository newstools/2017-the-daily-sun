MORE than 50 animals were recovered after police received two anonymous tip-offs regarding stock theft on Wednesday night. In both incidents, men were bust transporting livestock suspected of having been stolen in Matatiele, Eastern Cape in bakkies to different destinations. They were arrested and charged with possession of stolen livestock. One of the suspects – who was travelling to Umzimkhulu in KZN – was also charged with speeding while trying to flee from the cops. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsscGWHw_U7JyQTmd-1OJnsum1slsovzDxg7wBX1Opg-jWsGGfy7o2LUd74PpiW5rFYkAbOVcCU52d19RxkV8j9fTTIZ4Tf1S-Y8i6OUQW0bLdEcMzX7-1VkB5S486GKSN2nr7iIDkoBRytr6l8Kg3ZFWy_0aj--WYlI77qBssbrhXKM4Qyr7KJE3OFP7l9JAdNe5q7vN3s-1T9ZnhrFN4kSv_ueCXXn3UNwjtZHaiJPDubrD7_tG8MQ_GfX-qTbw_ZQvUJe_1ARv0423KIwBsjvhMAruZM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzM5vRW1Leir_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The members tried to stop the vehicle but the suspect sped off. “He was later bust after a high speed chase.”Cops arrested another suspect after he was caught driving a bakkie carrying 28 sheep suspected to have been stolen just after midnight. Motloung requested farmers and members of the public to assist in identifying the stock. He said stock theft was a serious problem in the area and said a number of cases were being investigated.
