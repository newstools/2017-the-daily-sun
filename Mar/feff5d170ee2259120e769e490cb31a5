A YOUNG mum&rsquo;s plan to spend the weekend with her seven-year-old daughter has ended in tragedy. The 26-year-old from Maphumulo in northern KZN was allegedly stabbed several times by the child&rsquo;s father on Saturday morning.The victim had travelled almost 120km from Durban to see her child. She was found dead in the house of the woman who took care of the girl during the week.A 47-year-old neighbour told Daily Sun she heard loud screams at about 1am. &ldquo;I rushed to the house and found the victim lying in a pool of blood. She told me several times the child&rsquo;s father had stabbed her in the upper body.&rdquo; The woman was rushed to Umphumulo Hospital but died on arrival. The neighbour suspected that the victim opened the door for the child&rsquo;s father after he phoned her on her cellphone. &ldquo;I heard a door opening before the screaming began but I thought she was just going to the outside toilet.&rdquo; The neighbour added that when the victim arrived on Friday, she mentioned that she had seen the child&rsquo;s father in the KwaDukuza CBD and that he had sworn at her. &ldquo;She previously told me this man would beat her whenever she tried to dump him. She even had a fracture after one beating,&rdquo; she said. However, she couldn&rsquo;t say what the couple fought over as she tried to keep out of other people&rsquo;s business. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident. &ldquo;A murder case was opened. &ldquo;The suspect is known to the police but is still is on the run,&rdquo; said Mbhele.
