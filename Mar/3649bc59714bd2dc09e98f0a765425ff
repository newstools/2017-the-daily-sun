POLOKWANE City secured a place in the last 16 of the Nedbank Cup following a 3-0 win over African All Stars at the Peter Mokaba Stadium last night.Goals from Puleng Tlolane, Salulani Phiri and Walter Musona ended the Gauteng ABC Motsepe&rsquo;s dream of progressing further in the competition.This was City&rsquo;s first win this year having last won a match on 14 December when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in the league at the same venue.On the other hand, the lowly ranked side were eager to avenge last year&rsquo;s 2-0 defeat in the same round of the Nedbank Cup. The Tsakane based side were hoping to go further in the competition as a motivation to improve their position where they occupy 10th spot.However, it was City striker Tlolane who broke the stalemate in the 24th minute when he beat keeper Tebogo Dlamini with a low shot from outside the penalty box.Ironically, Tlolane is the one who ended All Stars fairytale run last year when he scored a brace that booted them out of the competition.The inexperienced side never gave up fighting as they knocked the ball around trying to unsettle the PSL side after the half-hour mark hoping to grab the equaliser. Phiri put matters beyond All Stars reach in the 72nd minutes when he unleashed a thunderous shot leaving Dlamini sprawled on the deck after being set-up by Mngomezulu who gave the minnows all sorts of trouble whenever in possession of ball.Musona hammered the final nail into All Stars coffin with an easy tap-in, while Bheki Shabangu scored the visitors consolation goal from the penalty spot two minutes before full time.
