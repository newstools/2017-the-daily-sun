THE man was driving down to Cape Town from Jozi on Friday night, and he wasn&rsquo;t planning on having any passengers . . . But before he knew what was happening, an uninvited guest landed right in his Mazda 323 passenger seat. A kudu bull crashed through the windscreen at midnight! His trip was cut short right there on the N1 outside Beaufort West, a town in the Western Cape.The slightly injured driver was taken to a local hospital for treatment, but the kudu bull died instantly.The SPCA&rsquo;s wildlife unit has warned motorists to be on the lookout for wild animals, especially at night.The unit&rsquo;s Cassie MacDonald said such incidents are mostly unexpected.&ldquo;Most wild animals graze at night to take advantage of the cool weather and are attracted by the sounds of cars and lights flashing by on roads.&rdquo;
