SGWILI Zuma is sick and tired of pastors treating him as if he is isigwili and has everything he needs!The gospel star angrily accused the pastors of abusing his Christianity during the NOS magazine launch at the Oceanic Hotel in Durban on Monday.He accused some pastors of undermining his career and himself as a person. He went to the point of stating that he was not a car!He said: &ldquo;There are pastors who have the nerve to book me and expect me to perform for free just because I&rsquo;m Christian. Some call me and tell me they will give me petrol money. &ldquo;I am not a car. This is my job. I am a family man, a father and a husband who has to provide for his family.&ldquo;I go on stage, sweat and entertain the congregants to support my family. I fail to understand why they are doing this.&rdquo;When approached by Daily Sun , Sgwili refused to name the pastors he was venting about. &ldquo;They know themselves so I won&rsquo;t mention names. All they need to know is that what they are doing hurts me. &ldquo;I worked hard to be where I am right now. &ldquo;I had to hustle and it was not easy. People, including pastors, need to respect my career and stop taking me for granted. &ldquo;I know as a Christian and a gospel singer I am expected to have a good heart and do favours but things don&rsquo;t work like that.&rdquo; A pastor from one of the churches Sgwili usually performs at said he was aware of what the singer was talking about.&ldquo;I know some pastors take advantage of gospel musicians and that should come to an end. &ldquo;Sgwili comes to my church and asks to perform. &ldquo;Most of the time there is no agreement on any payment,&rdquo; said the pastor.
