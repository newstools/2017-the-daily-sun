ROAD fatalities in South Africa pose a greater threat to life than HIV/Aids.So said Mpumalanga Community Safety, Security and Liaison MEC Pat Ngomane. He was speaking at a meeting with the interprovincial technical task team on Thursday. The task team is in the process of finding solutions to and ways of preventing interprovincial crime and safety-related matters.Ngomane said car accidents are robbing the country of skilled young people, and some of the victims are bread-winners.&ldquo;The reality is that car accidents cause more deaths in SA than HIV/Aids,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;If we do not do something dramatic and urgent, we are going to lose our country&rsquo;s skills base. People who die on our roads are young, skilled and breadwinners. These are people who are critically needed for the development of our country.&rdquo;Ngomane urged all provinces to look into the matter seriously and said that traffic authorities should work towards 24-hour law- enforcement shifts.Ngomane also called on communities to play an active role in fighting the scourge of road accidents.&ldquo;We need to work together and share best practices to urgently save lives,&rdquo; added Ngomane.
