TRANSPORT Minister Dipuo Peters has announced the new interim board for the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa.Peters released the names of the board members to oversee the affairs of the entity at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday. The members are chairman Nazir Ali, Frans Baleni, Ronny Mkhwanazi, Tiyani Rikhotso, Natalie Skeepers, Constance Mal-eho from the transport department and Xolile George.Peters&rsquo; announcement follows her disbandment of the former board last week. She claimed to have given the former board enough time to deal with issues that brought public spats and disrepute to the rail agency.&ldquo;I raised concerns on the recent allegations contained in the Sunday Times report of 26 February titled, &lsquo;Mr Fix It ups own pay by 350%&rsquo;. &ldquo;I therefore instructed the board to duly investigate the matter and report back to me by 3 March, to ensure that timeous and appropriate action is taken,&rdquo; said Peters.&rdquo; She said despite her persistent plea to the board and then acting CEO Collins Letsoalo not to further aggravate instability, her pleas fell on deaf ears.George, from the South African Local Government Association, is the only one who retains his position, together with a representative of the national Treasury, Landon McMillan.Peters has promised to monitor progress and ensure necessary controls and systems are put in place.Meanwhile, former chairman Popo Molefe has filed an urgent court application to have Peters&rsquo; decision to dissolve the board set aside.The matter will be heard in the North Gauteng High Court on Thursday.
