PLATINUM Stars dealt a big blow to Bidvest Wits&rsquo; chances of winning the Absa Premiership title last season with a damaging 1-1 draw at Milpark Stadium. That draw was a huge setback for the Clever Boys, as they fell six points behind champions Mamelodi Sundowns as a result, and Downs ended up winning the league. Coach Gavin Hunt could not hide his frustration at the time, throwing a tantrum after the match. And not much has changed since that fateful night last season &ndash; the Clever Boys are again chasing the championship title, while Dikwena are looking to end the season in the top eight. The Clever Boys host Dikwena for their Absa Premiership second round tie at Milpark Stadium on Saturday (6pm). And while a draw or defeat for Wits will not be as damaging as it was at this stage last season, Hunt&rsquo;s men will still be eager to claim the three points in this tight championship title race. The Students put Dikwena to the sword with a damaging 4-0 victory in Rustenburg in the first round and Hunt&rsquo;s men are overwhelming favourites to compete the double. Dikwena seem to have recovered from their slump and are on track to end their league campaign in the top eight bracket. They defeated Golden Arrows 2-0 at home in their previous match, while the Clever Boys were held to a goalless draw by Chippa United in their last outing. Cavin Johnson&rsquo;s men occupy eighth position with 25 points from 20 games. Wits are among the favourites to clinch their first league title in the Premiership era. They are second in the log table with 38 points from 19 matches. The Clever Boys have been ruthless in their home matches since the beginning of the year, demolishing both Ajax Cape Town and Baroka FC 5-0 in two goal feasts. Both teams, along with SuperSport United, will feature in the Confederation Cup last 32 round on 7-9 April and 14-16 April. Wits face Smouha (Egypt), AS Tanda (Ivory Coast) meet Platinum Stars, and BYC (Liberia) play SuperSport.
