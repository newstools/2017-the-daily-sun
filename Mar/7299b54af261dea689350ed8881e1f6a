GOLDEN Arrows coach Clinton Larsen is looking beyond bragging rights should his boys beat their rivals, Maritzburg United, in a KwaZulu-Natal derby on Saturday. Larsen says there are far more important gains to be had for his team when they face the Team of Choice in an Absa Premiership match at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu (6pm) on Saturday. &ldquo;A top eight spot is at stake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you look at the standings, there are about seven teams that still stand a chance of earning a top eight spot. It could go down to the wire. So that is why it is important for us to beat Maritzburg to solidify our place in the top eight.&rdquo; Only one point separates Arrows and Maritzburg. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende are seventh with 24 points and the Team of Choice eighth with 23 points. Larsen said: &ldquo;Three points are much more important than bragging rights at this stage. That would take us to 27 points and we would be able to widen the gap between us and Maritzburg. It will also ensure that we will not be dragged into the relegation battle as the last matches approach,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will be able to focus more on the top eight battle.&rdquo;
