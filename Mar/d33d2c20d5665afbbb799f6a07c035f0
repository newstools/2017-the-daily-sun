THE patients are so angry about the shortage of nurses and medicine that they shut the clinic down with burning tyres at the gate. The 60 patients who closed KwaZakhele Clinic in Port Elizabeth said the nurses turn away many sick people as they take only 50 patients a day. Two nurses and four care workers stood at the door of the clinic while patients sang freedom songs and danced. District health officials arrived, but the patients were angry with them too. Patient Phumelele Tyukana told Daily Sun the shortage of nurses was affecting them badly because they go home without treatment and medicine. &ldquo;The nurses told us they would take only 50 patients as one nurse was sent to assist at KwaZakhele Day Hospital. &ldquo;We will continue with the protest until the department has addressed our concerns,&rdquo; said Phumelele. &ldquo;I have been coming to this clinic every day for a week to get medicine, but I go home empty-handed. &ldquo;There are only two nurses. One is for maternity and the other helps children. We give the department until Tuesday to employ more nurses and cleaners.&rdquo; Siphokazi Msuthu from the district health department said she did not know there were only two nurses on duty. &ldquo;We are talking to senior officials and we will send a nurse to assist,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am talking to officials. &ldquo;Please go back to the clinic. The door is open,&rdquo; she told patients. The defiant patients said there was no medicine or treatment at the clinic and there had not been a doctor since December. &ldquo;We are giving you until Tuesday, or we will start a fire inside the clinic,&rdquo; a patient said.
