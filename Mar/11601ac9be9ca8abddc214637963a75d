IZINYOKA don&rsquo;t care about the people. They only care about money and themselves. This is what Ntombozi Fihla (56) from Airportville squatter camp, Walmer, Port Elizabeth feels about the people who connect electricity illegally in her kasi.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared of the izinyoka cables. I have seen many people killed by these lines. In less than five years at least 10 people have died.&rdquo;Ntombozi said she uses a candle and a paraffin stove as she can&rsquo;t afford the high price charged for illegal power.&ldquo;The izinyoka charge R250 a month and a connection fee of R50. If the electricity fails, people have to pay for a connection again.&rdquo;She has stopped going out at night and doesn&rsquo;t even attend vigils. She wants the municipality to get rid of the lines.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m begging mayor Athol Trollip to give us proper electricity.&rdquo;She said people have been waiting too long for RDPs. Another resident, Zolelwa Macala (38), said: &ldquo;I would be a happy woman if the municipality gave us proper electricity. I&rsquo;m paying an inyoka and it costs me a lot of money.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We are connecting legal electricity in Walmer kasi. We started last year but it is going to take time. People should stop using izinyoka because their cables are dangerous.&rdquo;
