PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has instructed the Minister of Finance, Mr Pravin Gordhan and Deputy Minister Mcebisi Jonas, to come home immediately.They are in the UK promoting South Africa and were due to go to the US to do the same. The US leg of the roadshow has now been cancelled.Commentators have warned that this may be a sign of a Cabinet reshuffle about to happen, which may see Gordhan removed from his position as finance minister.Zuma&rsquo;s move has seen the rand, which had been showing signs of strength recently, once again dipping. As soon as the rumours started that Gordhan had been ordered home this morning, the rand lost 19c against the dollar &ndash; from R12.50/$ to R12.31/$. The rand has since bounced back slightly.Nqabayomzi Kwankwa, aUDF MP, believes Zuma&rsquo;s move was most likely because the president intends to reshuffle his Cabinet.&ldquo;But we shouldn&rsquo;t accept this lying down. Political parties can&rsquo;t accept this lying down. We can&rsquo;t twiddle our thumbs.&rdquo;Kwankwa &nbsp;agreed that Cabinet ministers serve at the pleasure of the president and that there&rsquo;s nothing opposition parties can do to prevent Zuma from reshuffling his Cabinet, but he called on ordinary South Africans to mobilise.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy for the ANC to dismiss opposition parties&rsquo; dissatisfaction as propaganda, but they can&rsquo;t do it when society demands the president resigns.&rdquo;Sudden removals of finance ministers tend to be full of risks, with markets often responding badly. In December 2015, Zuma unexpectedly fired finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, replacing him with little known ANC backbencher Des van Rooyen.Economists estimate this move cost the South African economy as much as R500 billion.Zuma as then forced to replace Van Rooyen with Gordhan just four days later.The #Rand after Pres #Zuma abruptly tells Minister #Gordhan and deputy #Jonas to return from selling #SouthAfrica to investors abroad pic.twitter.com/7gI6T0UYCD&mdash; Charl Linde (@linde_charl) March 27, 2017What an irresponsible non-statement, given the likely impact on the markets.
