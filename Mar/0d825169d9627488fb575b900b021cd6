SOME showbiz insiders are concerned the US may have turned Pearl Thusi into an extravagant diva. Claimed the first source: &ldquo;She suddenly expects a lot. Since her return from the US, she&rsquo;s been extremely demanding.&rdquo; According to the source, the star was on a two-week break from shooting her US TV series, Quantico, and is in the country to record episodes for the local version of MTV&rsquo;s music show, Lip Sync Battle Africa.A second source told Sunday Sun Pearl&rsquo;s demands had left MTV stunned.&ldquo;She asked the TV channel to book her a stay at a hotel and spa,&rdquo; the second source claimed.&ldquo;This is a stone&rsquo;s throw away from her fiance, sports host Robert Marawa&rsquo;s Northcliff house. She also demanded a rental car for the duration of the shoot.&rdquo; She was asked why she couldn&rsquo;t stay at her own house or use her car to whiz about, said the source.&ldquo;But she told us she had sold everything before she left. We were not sure whether she was bluffing or not.&rdquo; A third source alleged it was suggested she stay with Robert, but Pearl allegedly said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay with him as we&rsquo;re not yet married.&rdquo; But the sources claimed they were unsure whether Pearl had become a diva, or that her requests were purely innocent.Pearl failed to respond to our question as she would answer her phone but not say a words. Her manager, Sarit Tomlinson, dismissed the allegations as false.She said she had arranged accommodation for Pearl and her daughter just for pampering themselves. Sarit said Pearl had been renting out her house. Those allegations are false. &ldquo;That stay was a gift from me to Pearl so she can bond with her daughter.&rdquo;
