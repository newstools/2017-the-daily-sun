Police spokesman Captain Mduduzi Godlwana said cops responded when the alarm went off at about 2am. He said the real cops were met with gunfire when they arrived, injuring one officer in the knee. The unknown criminals then fled with an undisclosed amount of money.Two state vehicles were also reportedly badly damaged.Godlwana said the robbers got away in two Sprinter vehicles which cops lost sight of during a car chase. He appealed to anyone who had information that could help to arrest the criminals to come forward. “It is clear that the robbery was planned as the strategy was very professional.” He said a case of business robbery was opened and other charges were expected to be formally laid once all the evidence was collected from the crime scene. This was the second such incident in Lusikisiki, following the robbery of Brown’s supermarket last year. A police officer was severely injured in this incident and the suspects were arrested.
