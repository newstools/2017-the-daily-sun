THEY SAY dogs are man&rsquo;s best friends &ndash; and Majesty must be the man who loves them most!Majesty Selwane (20), from Zuurbekom in Westonaria, Gauteng works at Soweto Animal Rescue and Advisory Centre, run by his father, Jerry Selwane.&ldquo;A clean dog is a happy dog,&rdquo; said Majesty, whose job starts at 7am. &ldquo;I clean 40 kennels and 80 dogs so they&rsquo;re safe and healthy,&rdquo; He said diseases are more easily transmitted if the place where they live is dirty. &ldquo;It causes them to lose weight and appetite. They sit down all the time instead of jumping around. I wash them once a week.&ldquo;Clean kennels ensure they stay clean too.&rdquo; Even difficult dogs are washed and he controls them with a leash, soaping them next to the bathtub. &ldquo;If you force a dog into a bath, it thinks you are fighting and will defend itself.&rdquo; Majesty said his love of dogs started when he was young. &ldquo;I used to play with them when my father worked for the SPCA.&rdquo; &ldquo;The way you treat them is how they treat you. If you show them love, they love you back.&rdquo; He has also done a year&rsquo;s training as an animal inspector.His own dog is called Smalls. &ldquo;He was rescued twice. He had infections and you could count his ribs. Now he&rsquo;s my night guard.&rdquo;
