MANCHESTER United manager Jose Mourinho is concerned that his side&rsquo;s inability to win home games may cost them a Champions League qualification spot this season.United remain sixth in the Premier League after being held to a 1-1 draw by Bournemouth on Saturday, their seventh Old Trafford stalemate of the season.&ldquo;The reality is we are losing too many points at home. These matches at home against Hull, Burnley, Bournemouth, Stoke &ndash; it&rsquo;s more of the same,&rdquo; said the Portuguese boss.&ldquo;If you look at the points we&rsquo;ve lost at home &ndash; all the matches we drew &ndash; you&rsquo;re thinking about 10 or 12. &ldquo;And with these points we wouldn&rsquo;t just be speaking about the top four, we&rsquo;d be speaking about the top two or the top one.&rdquo;Despite being unbeaten in the league since losing at Chelsea late October, United have failed to turn dominant performances into victories, leaving them three points off fourth-placed Liverpool with one game in hand.&ldquo;Are we dead in relation to the top four? No. We are not dead &ndash; there are matches to play, points to win, points to lose, points to fight for &ndash; but the reality is we are losing too many points at home,&rdquo; the 54-year-old added.United visit Russian side Rostov in a Europa League tie on Thursday before switching their focus to their FA Cup quarterfinal away at Chelsea. &ndash; REUTERS
