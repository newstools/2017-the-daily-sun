HER son is eight and has not been at school for a month . . . A teacher allegedly told him to go home and not come back!The boy&rsquo;s mother, Pinky Gumede (32) from Waterloo in Durban, blames Home Affairs for her child&rsquo;s situation.&ldquo;I went to apply for my son&rsquo;s birth certificate in August 2009, seven days after he was born,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But officials told me it was impossible because I had already given birth in June. They told me I couldn&rsquo;t register two children in one year.&ldquo;They told me my ID book showed I had another child that I gave birth to in June.&rdquo;It revealed that she shared an ID number with somebody else, so she applied for a new one. But it came out the same.Pinky can&rsquo;t apply for a child support grant, either.&ldquo;I have gone to their offices over the years but nothing changes.&ldquo;It pains me to see my child sitting at home.&rdquo; She said she didn&rsquo;t have this problem with her firstborn, who is now 13.KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said Pinky must contact the department so they could help her. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Makgola said the matter was referred to the provincial manager. &ldquo;He will delegate an official to contact her to resolve the issue,&rdquo; Makgola assured Daily Sun.
