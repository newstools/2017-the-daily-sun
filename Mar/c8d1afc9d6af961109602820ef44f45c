LAST season, Athletics SA (ASA) short themselves in the foot when they put together the 4x100m relay team at the 11th hour in an attempt to qualify for the Olympic Games.The team dismally failed to qualify for the Olympic Games, leaving Mzansi with no relay team in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The bottom line is there was just not enough time to assemble a team late and expect them to qualify for such a big event.But ASA is leaving no stone unturned in their quest to rectify their mistakes in the build-up to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.The quartet of Akani Simbine, Henricho Bruintjies, Gift Leotlela and Clerence Munyai produced fireworks when they ran an impressive time in the men&rsquo;s 4x100m relay to clock 38.47 seconds at the final leg of the SA Speed Series in Germiston midweek.The four athletes are preparing for the IAAF World relays championships in Bahamas from 22 to 23 April.The big one is the IAAF World Championships in London in August where the team will test themselves against big names.Olympic silver medallist and ASA team manager Hezekiel Sepeng said the future looks bright for SA&rsquo;s relay teams.But Sepeng said the bigger picture is the Tokyo Olympic Games where the team is expected to aim for the podium.Said Sepeng: &ldquo;The relay team is now on board for real. They have had two competitions and one training session, and they are gelling nicely as a team.&rdquo;&ldquo;They must keep on working hard and share the same goal. They are preparing for the Bahamas competition and we expect them to compete and not go there just to add to the numbers.&rdquo; SA&rsquo;s relay team have been invited to Kenya for a training camp in preparation for the upcoming championships in Bahamas.Simbine said he is excited about the world relays and that he expects the team to compete at the world relays.Simbine said: &ldquo;If we train and work hard as a team we will be ready for Tokyo. These competitions will help us to improve.&rdquo;Bruintjies, who competed in the men&rsquo;s 200m at the Olympics, said the team is on the right track.Bruintjies said: &ldquo;I feel we can put together a team and if we get some good training sessions, we will really do well. This is just the beginning.&rdquo;
