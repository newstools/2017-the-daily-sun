We spotted TV personality Lerato Kganyago and Entertainer Knaomi wearing the same &nbsp;Plaid printed jumpsuit by Style Alert SA.&nbsp; Lerato wore the jumpsuit with cork wedge shoes, gold jewelry and big Jackie O inspired clear sunglasses.&nbsp; Knaomi wore the jumpsuit with very little accessory with just sandal lace up heels and studded earrings.&nbsp; Both ladies are very stylish but have different senses of style.&nbsp; Who do you think wore it best?&nbsp;Today in my @stylealertsa, basically doing the damn thing! ?? - #OOTD #MovieMusicFest #Melanin #BlackGirlMagic #BlackGirlDreams #Love #Happiness #Style #FashionA post shared by K Naomi Noinyane (@knaomin) on Dec 1, 2016 at 8:59am PSTFriday Love ?? jumpsuit by @stylealertsaA post shared by Leratokganyago (@leratokganyago) on Dec 30, 2016 at 7:40am PST
