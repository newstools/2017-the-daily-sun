THIS madala is able to look after himself, even though he does not have an education. Madala Moitoi Moleng (65) of section K in Botshabelo dropped out in primary school. Now he fixes bags and shoes for a living. The madala said he joined a union years ago to fight for the rights of miners. But at the end of the 1980s he found himself without a job. &ldquo;I feared going back to the mines because my bosses were starting to target me. &ldquo;They accused me of being a bad influence on the other workers,&rdquo; he said.Some of his colleagues even called him a coward when he decided to stop working at the mine. But because he was determined not to return to the mine, he learned other ways of making money. With no income and a family to take care of, madala Moitoi then decided to learn how to fix shoes and bags. He said he does not regret the choice he made. Madala Moitoi runs his sewing business outside Botshabelo shopping complex. He said he chose the open spot because it makes it easy to market his work. The skill he learned about 20 years ago is finally paying off. He said although he is a pensioner, the money he makes from his business helps him buy everything he needs. &ldquo;I want young people to understand there are other ways of earning an income without getting in trouble.&rdquo;
