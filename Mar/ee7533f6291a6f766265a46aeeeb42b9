MANGALISO Nhlapo (28) said his life is a mess.The man from Kya Sands squatter camp, Randburg said he blames his parents.He said he doesn&rsquo;t know his parents, and has come all the way from KZN to Joburg to try and find them. Mangaliso has never had a birth certificate or any document in his life, which has made his life harder. He said what&rsquo;s even worse is that he has never been to school.&ldquo;I was born in KZN and was raised by my gogo. She told me that my parents abandoned me and my siblings when we were very young,&rdquo; said Mangaliso,&ldquo;My gogo tried her best to raise us but when she died in 2014, I was forced to look after my siblings. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any other family, and I was told my parents lived somewhere in Joburg.&rdquo;In 2015 he came to Joburg to look for his parents.&ldquo;But when I arrived in Joburg, things went from bad to worse. I was stranded and didn&rsquo;t know where to start. &ldquo;I lived on the streets for seven months,&rdquo; said Mangaliso.Luckily, he was helped by a woman called Busisiwe Mbeki (30), who took him in and looked after him. &ldquo;I tried to apply for an ID at Home Affairs, but had no luck.&rdquo; Thabo Mokgola, spokesman for Home Affairs, said: &ldquo;We need proof that he is indeed a South African citizen before we can issue him with an ID. &ldquo;Since he claims he was raised by his gogo, he must have other relatives. &ldquo;He should come with one of his relatives, who will confirm he was born in South Africa and was raised by his gogo. The department will then conduct its own investigation before he can be issued with any documents.&rdquo;Nandi Mosia, spokeswoman for Sassa, said: &ldquo;Mangaliso should go to Sassa offices and apply for social relief of distress, which will give him food parcels every month for the time being. &ldquo;Or he can apply for a provision which will allow him to get a temporary grant while he&rsquo;s still waiting for his documents to be issued.&rdquo;
