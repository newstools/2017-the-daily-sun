BAFANA Bafana striker Kermit Erasmus has dropped a bombshell about his football career. The 26-year-old forward for Lens in France, where he is on loan from Rennes, said he regretted returning to Mzansi in 2010 and should have fought for his place in Europe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d played in Europe before &ndash; coming back to South Africa was a mistake,&rdquo; said the striker from Port Elizabeth. &ldquo;Not that there&rsquo;s something bad about South African football but coming back was definitely my biggest mistake in my football career so far.&ldquo;This loan move to Lens has been good for me. I&rsquo;m enjoying football and getting a lot of game-time. My family has been very supportive and they are happy that I&rsquo;m now getting regular play time.&rdquo;The ex-Orlando Pirates star is currently in the Bafana Bafana camp in Durban preparing for a friendly against Guinea-Bissau at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm).Erasmus is known for not holding back on his opinion, tweeting two years ago that he was not a &ldquo;back-up player&rdquo;, which ruined his relationship with axed coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba. Their relationship turned sour when he turned to Twitter after turning down a call-up to Bafana when Tokelo Rantie dropped out. Now that Mashaba has left, Erasmus has returned, responding to the call-up by caretaker coach Owen Da Gama two weeks ago. At yesterday&rsquo;s press conference in Durban the former SuperSport United marksman said what happened with the national football association was a thing of a past. He said: &ldquo;The important thing now is that I&rsquo;m here and ready to play for my national team. I can&rsquo;t talk about what happened in the past, everyone knows what happened. &ldquo;All my focus is on enjoying my call-up and making sure I do well for myself and the team.&rdquo; ALSO SEE INSIDE.
