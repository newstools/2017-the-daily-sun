IF YOU&rsquo;RE still playing in the first division in bed but want to make it to the big leagues, mama Josephine Machethe has just the thing for you.The 59-year-old gogo from Makushane Village in Phalaborwa claims her traditional marula beer cleans the body, leaving men refreshed and performing like PSL strikers between the sheets! Josephine has been making her traditional beer for more than 15 years and the money she makes from selling the drink helps her put food on the table for her family. &ldquo;I recommend my beer as it will make men drunk but it won&rsquo;t leave them with a hangover,&rdquo; said Josephine.A 44-year-old man who didn&rsquo;t want to be named said his wife nearly divorced him because he was failing to perform in bed. &ldquo;Thanks to Josephine&rsquo;s beer, my marriage is back on track. There are no more fights at home and my wife loves me more than ever,&rdquo; he said.Josephine explained how the beer is prepared. She said: &ldquo;First we collect marula fruits, peel them and put them inside a 20 litre steel drum. We add water and stir the mixture with our own hands so that the water absorbs the sweetness and taste of the marula.&ldquo;We then remove the water and pour it into another bucket, storing it overnight.&ldquo;The following day the beer is ready for consumption. The best thing about our beer is that we do not add anything.&rdquo;
