FOR six years, Granny Lehana (54) has had to look at the broken tombstone at the graves of her daughter and her mother. The tombstone was destroyed by vandals in 2010. But now the Rand West City Local Municipality in Randfontein, Gauteng, has committed itself to bringing joy to the sad gogo.Spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe told Daily Sun the gogo should come and see him in April.&ldquo;I commit the municipality to finding a solution,&rdquo; he said.Granny said she was at a funeral in 2010 at the Bekkersdal graveyard, when she heard that somebody had destroyed the tombstone.Daily Sun published the story on 31 December 2010.Granny had spent R10 000 for the stone to pay tribute to her daughter Mapaseka Rampai and her mum Ellen Rampai. The cops arrested a man but he was later released, allegedly because he was mentally ill and not fit to stand trial.Granny said people canvassing for votes for the ANC in 2011 local government elections had promised to help her, but nothing came of it.&ldquo;They promised me a big Hollywood-style party to celebrate the new tombstone, but I am still waiting,&rdquo; she said.
