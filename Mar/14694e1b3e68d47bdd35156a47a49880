ABOUT 10 thieves robbed a school on Wednesday afternoon. They entered the principal&rsquo;s office at Sibonise Primary School in J Section, KwaMashu, and robbed him of his laptop, two cellphones and money before fleeing. School caretaker Zamokuhle Simelane (43) said the thugs came into the schoolyard and asked if they could drink water. &ldquo;Two thugs went into the principal&rsquo;s office and held him at gunpoint. The other thugs entered and demanded his belongings.&rdquo; Principal Moses Madonsela later asked around and a resident said he knew one of the suspects. Simelane said they informed the cops and went to the suspect&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;The suspect&rsquo;s father co-operated with us. When his son came home he called us. We went to the house with the police and found him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He pointed out two other suspects.&rdquo; Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said KwaMashu police arrested three suspects aged between 18 and 19 for armed robbery. &ldquo;Cops recovered the stolen items. The suspects will appear in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court soon. We&rsquo;re looking for the other suspects,&rdquo; she said. Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said: &ldquo;It is clear that our schools are becoming soft targets for thieves. We have confidence in our police that they will protect us.&rdquo;
