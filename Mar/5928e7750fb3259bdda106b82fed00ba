KAIZER Chiefs defender Lorenzo Gordinho and Cape Town City captain Lebogang Manyama are determined to leave an impression in the Bafana Bafana fold. The two have been brilliant for their teams so far this season and it came as no surprise when they were called up to Owen Da Gama&rsquo;s team. Manyama, who has played for Bafana before, is tied on 11 Absa Premiership goals this season with Orlando Pirates marksman Tendai Ndoro. Gordinho has bragging rights at Amakhosi where he is second on the goal-scorers&rsquo; chart with four goals, along with Bernard Parker and Willard Katsande &ndash; just one goal shy of leader Siphiwe Tshabalala&rsquo;s total of five.Manyama and Gordinho&rsquo;s club form would certainly be appreciated by Da Gama if they succeed in taking it to Bafana, where they are set to get a run against Guinea-Bissau in a friendly at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (3pm).Manyama said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great honour for me to get this call-up. I&rsquo;m very excited to be here and looking forward to the game, where I&rsquo;m hoping to get few goals for Bafana. &ldquo;The call-up is a result of my hard work this season and I&rsquo;m really grateful.&rdquo;Amakhosi centre-back Gordinho also shared his excitement about his first Bafana call-up: &ldquo;For me it is important to take my club performance into the national team. It&rsquo;s all about being consistent, performing well and hopefully cementing my place in the squad.&rdquo;He added that donning the Bafana jersey would help him achieve his personal goal of plying his trade overseas in future. Gordinho recently underwent trials with Fulham and Aalborg in England and Denmark respectively. &ldquo;It is important for every South African player to play for their national team. And for me it would be an achievement to be a regular in the team. &ldquo;But nothing is guaranteed. I have to work hard, hopefully the rest will follow,&rdquo; added the player.
