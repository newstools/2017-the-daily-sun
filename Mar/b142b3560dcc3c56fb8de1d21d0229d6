TRAFFIC officers had to cut short their lunch break yesterday to chase after armed thugs. The Gauteng traffic officers were eating their kotas near the Soweto Theatre in Jabulani when a crowd suddenly came running towards them. One of the officers said: &ldquo;We went to check what was going on and we were approached by a hysterical woman screaming &lsquo;they have guns!&rsquo; &ldquo;We got into our car and chased after three armed men.&rdquo;The cops said they were told the men had just robbed people of their cellphones at the theatre. &ldquo;One of them disappeared into the crowd but they went after the other two. &ldquo;The men were chased from Jabulani to White City on foot. &ldquo;More and more people joined the chase, even though most of them didn&rsquo;t know what was going on,&rdquo; said the officer. The crowd managed to grab one of the thugs while the officers bust the other one. &ldquo;We could see he was tired as he was running more slowly. He was running in an open space, so it was easy to catch him,&rdquo; said the officer. The officer said when the thug saw they were close to him, he fired three shots.One of the shots hit the front of their police car. They returned fire, shooting the thug in the hip and foot. &ldquo;He seemed very calm and didn&rsquo;t care about being shot. &ldquo;We could see he felt like a hero,&rdquo; said the officer.Gauteng traffic department spokeswoman Busaphi Nxumalo confirmed the shooting in White City. &ldquo;A thief shot at officers. &ldquo;They shot back and he was hit twice. &ldquo;He was taken to hospital and is under police guard.&rdquo;
