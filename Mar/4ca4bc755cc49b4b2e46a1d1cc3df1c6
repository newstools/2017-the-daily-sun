Dlamini had until March 31 to show why she should not be joined to the proceedings in her personal capacity, and why she should not pay the costs of the application from her own pocket. If CPS wanted to change how much it got paid, it could approach National Treasury.  Dlamini and Sassa were ordered to file affidavits every three months.- Read more:Â What Justice Froneman said on Sassa judgmentThe court gallery was packed to capacity with journalists, lawyers and supporters of the Black Sash.On Wednesday, the court heard an application by the Black Sash for an order that it exercise supervisory jurisdiction over any new contract to pay social grants and its implementation.During the hearing, a frustrated Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng asked how Sassa and Dlamini came to be seen to display such incompetence in their handling of the debacle.
