A DISTURBING photo of a teacher kissing a pupil has left parents worried. The photo shows a man who looks like he&rsquo;s in his 40s kissing a very young girl. She appears to have love bites on her neck and chest. The photo has led to many parents taking their kids out of the school in Lenasia South, Joburg, where the man works. A 75-year-old gogo said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken my two grandchildren out of that school and they&rsquo;re attending night school now. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I saw the photo. &ldquo;I thought it was a joke at first. They have to get rid of him.&rdquo;Another concerned parent said she wanted the school to take drastic steps. &ldquo;I have a 16-year-old daughter. I would not like to see that happening to her.&rdquo; Tumi Moatshe, a former member of the school&rsquo;s governing body, claimed the teacher had been buying groceries for the girl&rsquo;s mum.She said the photo first surfaced last year but there had not been any SGB meetings to discuss the issue. The teacher was reportedly suspended, but there were claims that he had been seen around the school. Oupa Bodibe, spokesman for the Gauteng Education Department, confirmed the man in the photo was a teacher who had been accused of having a sexual relationship with a pupil. &ldquo;The department has completed an investigation and the teacher still needs to go through disciplinary processes.&ldquo;Once the matter is completed, the outcome will be communicated.&ldquo;Teachers and school managers have an ethical duty to report such cases to the authorities.&rdquo;
