Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli has been handed a three-match ban in European competition following his sending off against Gent in the Europa League.The talented Englishman was dismissed in the 39th minute of the Wembley Stadium clash after a tackle on Brecht Dejaegere, with the game ultimately ending in a 2-2 draw.Alli, who is no stranger to controversy, was hugely missed by Spurs as their title-chasing 2015/16 season fizzled out in their final few games, with the player sidelined after admitting a charge of violent conduct for punching West Brom's Claudio Yacob in the stomach.Arsenal have, meanwhile, been fined &pound;4,300 for failing to control their fans, as a number of supporters invaded the pitch during the 5-1 Champions League loss to Bayern Munich.And Bayern Munich were fined &pound;2,600 for delaying the European contest as a number of their fans threw rolls of paper onto the pitch, which was reportedly in protest over ticket prices.
