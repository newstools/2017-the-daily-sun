BUDDIES and former working partners Serame Letsoaka and Gordon Igesund will again sit on opposing benches this weekend when their battling sides, Free State Stars and Highlands Park, lock horns in a relegation battle at Goble Park on Sunday (3.30pm). &ldquo;There are no friends on the field,&rdquo; said Letsoaka, whose Stars are 14th in the PSL table. Letsoaka and Igesund&rsquo;s journey together started at Bafana Bafana in 2012 when Igesund was appointed head coach and took Letsoaka under his wing as assistant. After being fired from Bafana in June 2014 Igesund joined SuperSport United in July the same year and didn&rsquo;t forget his friend Letsoaka, taking his assistant with him. There they won the Telkom Knockout title together but were fired nine months later in January last year.They went their separate ways and that was when Letsoaka got his first job as head coach at Golden Arrows in July 2015. But he only lasted four months at the Durban outfit, becoming Bloemfontein Celtic coach two days after leaving Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende. He left Celtic 11 months later to join rivals Free State Stars in January this year. While Letsoaka had been busy changing teams, Igesund had been clubless until October last year when he took charge of struggling Highlands Park. They both face the mammoth task of trying to save their respective teams from relegation. Letsoaka said: &ldquo;We both desperately need to collect maximum points. And while I realise both teams need points, we can&rsquo;t afford to drop points at home. There are no excuses. And whatever the outcome we will shake hands at the end of the match.&rdquo;Only four points separate the two teams at the basement of the Absa Premiership table.
