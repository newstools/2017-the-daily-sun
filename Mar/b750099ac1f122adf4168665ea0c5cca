POLOKWANE City head coach Luc Eymael will be taking nothing for granted when his charges face Baroka FC in an Absa Premiership Polokwane derby at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday (3.30pm).The Belgian-born coach has done wonders since he took charge of Rise and Shine at the start of the season. They are sixth in the log with 25 points from 19 matches.Baroka, on the other hand, are bottom on 13 points and have chopped and changed coaches this year, having reinstated Kgoloko Thobejane recently after demoting him.They lost their previous two matches 5-0 away to Bidvest Wits and 3-0 at home to Cape Town City under Thobejane.But warned Eymael: &ldquo;This is a derby and we can&rsquo;t look at the table. A derby is always special. &ldquo;We will go into it with confidence but we won&rsquo;t allow ourselves to make the mistake of being over-confident. There is a lot of pride at stake.&rdquo;Eymael has impressed with his entertaining brand of football but said: &ldquo;It is not just me but the players who deserve credit, as they have adapted to my tactics and methods.&rdquo; Eymael&rsquo;s main man will be ace striker Rodney Ramagalela, who has scored in the club&rsquo;s last two games, which both ended 1-1 (against Ajax Cape Town and Orlando Pirates).Said Eymael: &ldquo;Rodney also scored against Kaizer Chiefs and that tells you something about the player&rsquo;s ability. &ldquo;He had all the talent when I got here. I have just helped him improve those skills.&rdquo;Other players Baroka need to watch out for are evergreen midfielder Jabu Maluleke and Sipho Jembula.Thobejane said: &ldquo;Derbies are difficult to predict but maybe we can make it and get the result in this derby.&rdquo;
