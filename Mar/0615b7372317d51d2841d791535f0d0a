THE Constitutional Court wants answers from Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini about the grants payment crisis. Dlamini is due to appear before the court on Wednesday to explain why a 2014 agreement stating that Sassa would start handling grant payments from next month was not implemented. In papers sent to her lawyers yesterday the court wanted to know:- Who was responsible for determining whether Sassa would not be able to pay grants by the end of this month;&nbsp;- The date the person became aware of this and the reason the court was not immediately informed;&nbsp;- Whether the minister was informed that Sassa would not be able to pay grants by the end of March and if so, when this had happened;&nbsp;- Whether Sassa entered into a new agreement with Cash Paymaster Services for the payment of grants and if this is the case, details of the agreement are required; and&nbsp;- Whether Sassa and Dlamini have objections to independent monitoring of any agreement with Cash Paymaster Services for the payment of grants, and what these objections would be.Social justice organisation Black Sash approached the court when it became clear Sassa was not ready to take over grant payments.The organisation wants the court to force the minister to make public all arrangements made with Cash Paymaster Services for the payment of grants from next month. The company said it would finalise the conditions of the new contract with lawyers on Monday and it would be up to Sassa to close the deal. Meanwhile, parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts is expected to call on Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan next week to discuss the ongoing crisis.
