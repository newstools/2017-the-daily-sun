I killed and skinned it. “Apart from its delicious meat, its skin works well as traditional medicine.” Building administrator Dumisani Zondi confirmed the lizards were troubling people in the building.He said: “I am currently working on contacting KZN Wildlife to ask whether they can remove these creatures.” Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesman Musa Mntambo said the lizards pose no threat if they are not provoked.“But they can be very harmful if someone irritates them. “We do remove the lizards from properties when requested to do so. “But if they are in the bush or an open field, we do not remove them because that is where they are supposed to live.”
