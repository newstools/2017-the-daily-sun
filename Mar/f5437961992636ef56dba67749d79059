THE PROTEAS will miss AB de Villiers following his decision to opt out of Test cricket this year, but their ranks have been bolstered by the return of Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander for the three-match series against New Zealand.Both players missed the limited-overs fixtures of the ongoing tour, with Morkel recovering from a career-threatening back injury and Philander dealing with a nagging ankle problem.South Africa have won their last three Test series and will head to England for a full tour starting in May.Their three-match series in New Zealand, which kicks off at University Oval in Dunedin tomorrow, could be a chance to work Morkel and Philander back into Test form.Proteas coach Russell Domingo said that while the absence of influential batsman De Villiers would be keenly felt in this series, they had no option but to move on.De Villiers&rsquo; flashing bat produced 262 runs in the five one-day matches at an average of 87.33, while his calm assuredness guided the side through several tense moments in New Zealand.&ldquo;Anybody, any coach, would want AB de Villiers in their side but he has made a decision and we respect that decision,&rdquo; Domingo said. &ldquo;We all definitely wanted him to stay but it&rsquo;s a decision he has made for family life.&ldquo;He will be missed but we&rsquo;ve gone through a series against Sri Lanka and a series in Australia without him, so the game goes on. &ldquo;As good as anyone is, the game goes on.&rdquo;Should Morkel and Philander replicate past form against New Zealand, however, De Villiers may not be missed much at all.The pair are likely to join Kagiso Rabada in an impressive pace attack after the 21-year-old showed in the final one-day international in Auckland on Saturday that he was warming to New Zealand conditions.South Africa will also be without fast bowler Dale Steyn, who is still recovering from a broken shoulder.New Zealand have an abysmal record against South Africa, having won just four of the previous 42 Test matches. The Proteas have won 24. &ndash; REUTERS
