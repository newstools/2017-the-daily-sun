FINANCE Minister Pravin Gordhan arrived at the North Gauteng High Court yesterday amid rumours that he had been sacked, And when he was mobbed by journalists who asked if he was still the minister, he answered, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.But he refused to entertain questions on whether he would step down if pressurised. Gordhan had arrived back in the country earlier in the morning from London, after his investor roadshow was cut short. He told journalists he had not yet been told why the president had recalled him.From the airport, he went straight to ANC headquarters at Luthuli House, where he was spotted going to party secretary-general Gwede Mantashe&rsquo;s office. This fuelled speculation that he would be sacked after reports emerged that Zuma had notified alliance partners SACP in a Monday night meeting that he was going to fire him.Gordhan then arrived in court as his legal representative, Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett told the court that negotiations for settlement between the two parties &ndash; the Guptas and Gordhan &ndash; could not be reached.The parties were allowed time to negotiate settlement after a ruling on preliminaries that saw most non-legal matters thrown out. These included sections of the Fica reports, the affidavit of Mcebisi Jonas, which alleged the Guptas offered him a job, and allegations by the Guptas that Gordhan had colluded with the banks.Gauntlett argued that Gordhan had approached the courts for protection from the Guptas, who kept insisting he should intervene, even though they admitted he had no powers to do so. Gauntlett also lambasted the allegations of political conspiracy. &ldquo;Nobody should be pushing the minister to do what he is not bound by the law to do,&rdquo; he said.The court hearing continues today.
