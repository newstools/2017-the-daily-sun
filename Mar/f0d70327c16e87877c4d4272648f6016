The resident, who said he only had one ARV pill left, said he came to the clinic for more tablets.&ldquo;They are gambling with our lives. &ldquo;The gogos who came to the clinic are here for their high blood pressure medication. &ldquo;Now their lives are also at risk.&rdquo;Mpumalanga Health spokesman Dumisani Malamule confirmed the clinic had closed. He said this was because of an argument between the department and the municipality over rental payments. He said: &ldquo;The matter is being addressed. &ldquo;Two temporary mobile clinics have been provided to ensure service continues. &ldquo;The department apologises for inconvenience caused.&rdquo;Municipal spokeswoman Sentebaleng Masemola said the municipality had switched off the power after they sent several notices requesting the clinic to settle its debt.
