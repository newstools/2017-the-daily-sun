WHEN Mzansi was told it would host the 2010 Soccer World Cup, some people had to make way for stadiums and new roads in and around Durban.They were promised new houses within 18 months and were moved to a transit camp in Isipingo. Months turned into years, and now the remaining 400 people in the camp hope their ordeal will soon be over.This after the municipality moved 14 families to the Cornubia RDP project north of Durban on Tuesday. More than 700 people have been living in the camp since 2009 after they were moved by eThekwini Municipality from areas including Umlazi, Malvern and the Bluff.In 2015, protesting people demanded RDPs from the municipality. Last year more than 200 people were moved to Cornubia, leaving behind about 500. They felt the RDP allocation was going too slowly, so they protested again in January this year. And now only 400 people are still waiting.Nomthandazo Memela (49) said: &ldquo;Seeing others moving to their new houses brings hope that our turn is coming soon.&rdquo;Mfanafuthi Gasa (43), who received his RDP house on Tuesday, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that I have finally left the filthy camp.&rdquo; Municipal spokeswoman Princess Nkabane said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll investigate why the allocation of RDPs took so long.&rdquo;
