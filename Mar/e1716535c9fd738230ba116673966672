BAFANA Bafana caretaker coach Owen Da Gama has taken a swipe at previous senior national team coaches for not doing South Africa&rsquo;s overseas-based players justice.Da Gama was speaking on the back of their 3-1 victory over Guinea-Bissau&rsquo;s African Wild Dogs at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium, where Bafana debutant Percy Tau slotted in a beautiful goal.The Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder&rsquo;s curling strike was complemented by penalty kicks by France-based Kermit Erasmus and Andile Jali, who plays for KV Oostende in Belgium.This was Da Gama&rsquo;s first match in charge since Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba was axed by Safa in Deember last year. Bafana will be looking to extend their clean record and make it 12 matches unbeaten when they face Angola at the Buffalo City Stadium in East London tomorrow (7pm). Da Gama said he would make changes for this match, where the likes of Luther Singh and Lorenzo Gordinho could start.But the 55-year-old mentor reckons previous coaches &ndash; not directly saying so but clearly referring to Mashaba &ndash; should have spent more time travelling overseas regularly to monitor how Mzansi players are performing at their clubs.This is something Mashaba ignored, even though it was a directive by Safa boss Danny Jordaan that coaches should make time to travel overseas and monitor SA players.CONTINUED ON PAGE 22
