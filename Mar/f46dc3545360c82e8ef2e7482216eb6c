MARITE Village is a problematic area in Mpumalanga, and crime and service delivery protests often disturb the peace.This is why the men and women in blue, councillors and provincial government officials held a prayer session at Rock Of Life Church in Oakley, outside Mkhuhlu, on Sunday.Speaking at the event, Acornhoek cluster commander Major-General Daniel Mashele said thugs take advantage of the confusion that protests create and do evil things to innocent citizens.&ldquo;The police and community should build a good relationship to fight crime. Criminals use protests as a tool to commit crime. We need to pray with pastors to fight this evil,&rdquo; Mashele said. &ldquo;We also want to warn community leaders not to use children during their protests. The police will arrest all those involved.&rdquo; Sasekani Manzini, the MEC for public works, roads and transport, said: &ldquo;We need to make sure every citizen is safe. Bushbuckridge has many routes and sites that attract tourists, and this increases the area&rsquo;s economic activity. &ldquo;The youth is involved in a variety of criminal activities, and we need pastors to help us in the moral regeneration of our young people. &ldquo;We need to bring back the credibility of our men and women in blue. People must trust and respect the police.&rdquo;
