THEY thought they were having a good day with all the cables they had stolen, but they didn&rsquo;t count on the two wide-awake gogos looking out for cable thieves. Gogo Emely Sekonyela (60) was in her yard in Freedom Park, Joburg on Monday morning when she noticed two men carrying a heavy 25 litre bucket and a black dustbin bag. She called her neighbour, Ntsai Meswe (62).The gogos stopped the suspicious looking men and asked them what was in the bucket. When they refused to talk, gogo Emely grabbed the bucket and found it was full of copper power cables.Angry residents arrived and grabbed the izinyoka before they could run.&ldquo;We are tired of criminals walking free in our streets,&rdquo; said gogo Emely.&ldquo;The community has decided to look after itself and be vigilant.&rdquo; She said many houses don&rsquo;t have electricity because of izinyoka who steal the cables.&ldquo;My neighbour doesn&rsquo;t have electricity because her cable was stolen last month. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t sit and do nothing, we will question everyone on the streets so that we can all live safely.&rdquo; Gogo Ntsai said they were fighting for what belongs to them.&ldquo;Many people protect their children, who are stealing our cables. &ldquo;We say we are coming for them because we are tired of crime in our area,&rdquo; said gogo Ntsai.The two suspects, along with the copper cables found in their possession, were taken by residents to the Eldorado Police Station and handed to the police.
