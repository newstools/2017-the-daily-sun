He said on Monday one of his passengers accidentally stepped on a used condom.&ldquo;She found a used condom under her shoe. She was disgusted and said she won&rsquo;t come back to our filthy rank again.&rdquo; They said they are worried about the health of their passengers and passersby.Queue marshal Richard Moloto (44) of zone 9 in Ga-Rankuwa said he has been working at the rank for over 15 years.He said on Monday, when he arrived at work he found condoms lying on the streets.&ldquo;I knew immediately it was the magoshas who threw them here. I had to sweep them away before our clients arrived.&rdquo; Street vendor Chiedza Kuhwaura (60) of Atteridgeville said the used condoms attract flies. &ldquo;They come on to my fruit and vegetables.&rdquo;A magosha said: &ldquo;Most clients leave with their condoms. We are professionals and would not throw our used condoms anywhere.&rdquo; She said the drivers are just jealous. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s because we make more money.&rdquo; The manager of magosha house Ipi Tombi, Huang Wg (24) didn&rsquo;t know there were dumped condoms nearby. &ldquo;Our trucks fetch used condoms every day. These were from nyaope smokers.&rdquo;
