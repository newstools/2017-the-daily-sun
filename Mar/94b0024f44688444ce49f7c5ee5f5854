THE Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and SACP in Gauteng will host their own memorial service for the struggle stalwart tomorrow after the official government event was postponed without any explanation.The Ahmed Kathrada and Nelson Mandela Foundations held an urgent press conference in Houghton this afternoon, shortly after the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) said in a statement the memorial had been postponed "until further notice".The 87-year-old ANC stalwart died on Tuesday. He was a hugely respected former&nbsp; anti-apartheid activist, political prisoner and politician. He was buried on Wednesday. His official government memorial was to take place at the University of Johannesburg's Soweto Campus.It will now take place at 2pm tomorrow at Johannesburg City Hall. Uncle Kathy's widow, Barbara Hogan and the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation expressed their anger and disgust at the memorial's cancellation and the president's Cabinet reshuffle.Speaking at the briefing, Hogan slammed the &ldquo;dastardly" deeds of a president who has "gone rogue", saying President Jacob Zuma has defied his own party.&ldquo;If this was a presidency that was listening to the sentiments of this country&sbquo; the funeral service of Mr Kathrada alone would have alerted them to the high emotions&sbquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The president is completely willing to push ahead with his own agenda."Surely they could have held off&sbquo; just a while&sbquo; out of respect for Kathrada&sbquo;&rdquo; said Hogan.Earlier today the GCIS statement did not say why the memorial was postponed and it was not immediately clear what led to the decision to do so.The press briefing by the foundation today comes exactly a year after Kathrada wrote to President Jacob Zuma asking him to step down. The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Nelson Mandela Foundation then released a joint media statement expressing their shock and sadness at both the unexplained cancellation of Uncle Kathy&rsquo;s memorial and Zuma&rsquo;s recent Cabinet reshuffle, ending the statement with: &ldquo;The people united will never be defeated! &ldquo;Our Country is not for sale!&rdquo;READ THE FULL STATEMENT HERE! http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kathrada-foundation-and-sacp-to-hold-own-memorial-for-the-struggle-stalwart-20170331
