OR TAMBO mayor Nomakhosazana Meth has brought relief to the families of three girls who drowned at a local construction site.Yesterday, the three families each received groceries worth R5 000 from Meth, who visited the victims&rsquo; homes and held prayers. Senior officials accompanied her.At the weekend, the bodies of Sinazo Mbeshu (11), Lindokuhle Singata and Esethu Madondile (both aged 10) were removed from the site in Payne Village, Mthatha.The three friends were last seen on Friday. The next day their clothes were found near the site of Anix Trading, which is digging trenches around the village. The trenches are part of a municipal project to instal water pipes supplying Payne, Zimbane and Mqanduli.The trenches were fulll of water following days of heavy rain, which halted construction. Police divers, who retrieved the bodies, struggled through the trenches with water up to their necks.Anix Trading CEO Monwabisi Jama said he sympathised with the families who had lost their loved ones. &ldquo;We do understand the families are emotional right now. But we took all the necessary safety precautions around the site. The trench is fenced and has a 24/7 security guard. The kids tore a small hole in a corner, took off their clothes and dived into the trench.&rdquo;Meth has promised the families the municipality will do its own investigation. &ldquo;Anyone found to be at fault will face the consequences. &ldquo;We plan to assist with the funeral, depending on the outcome of our investigation,&rdquo; she said.Sinazo&rsquo;s father Zwelethu Mbeshu said their daughters were very close. &ldquo;They were pillars of strength for each other. In 2014, they were raped by a local bishop who has since been sentenced and is serving life behind bars.&ldquo;They had dreams and were full of laughter. They played together and now they have died together.&rdquo;
