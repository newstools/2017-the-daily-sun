SIYATHEMBA Mzamo (31) from Langa is gatvol after his shack was allegedly demolished by Metro cops. He told Daily Sun he was renovating his shack when patrolling cops asked for a permit for the structure. &ldquo;I showed them a permit, but they said there&rsquo;s a new law that requires a particular permit if they want to renovate their structure.&rdquo; Siyathemba told the People&rsquo;s Paper that he immediately went to the municipal offices to get a permit, but the following day the Metro cops demolished his shack. &ldquo;I wanted to put windows in my shack because IA have a three-month-old baby. &ldquo;The shack was too hot for the baby,&rdquo; he said. Siyathemba said he wasn&rsquo;t given any notice and when the cops demolished the shack, most of his belongings were in it. &ldquo;I had to take my wife and child to my brother&rsquo;s place, while I sleep in the demolished shack because thugs may steal some of my things.&rdquo; Community leader Pheko Nqandile said Siyathemba was not building a new shack, but renovating it. &ldquo;He has been living in the area for the past two years. What happened to Siyathemba and his family is sad,&rdquo; said Pheko. Stuart Diamond, acting member of the mayoral committee for informal settlements, water and waste services, said: &ldquo;The construction of a new illegal structure was discovered on 14 February. &ldquo;The two men who were erecting the structure were interviewed, and it was found that the permission they received did not come from the City of Cape Town.&rdquo;
