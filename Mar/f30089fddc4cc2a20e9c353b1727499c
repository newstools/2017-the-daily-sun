PERCY Maimela said meeting Joe Mafela in 2009 changed his outlook on life.&ldquo;I would not have been who I am today if it wasn&rsquo;t for Bra Joe,&rdquo; the 32-year-old artist said. &ldquo;I only met the man once in my life. In the 30 minutes that we spent together, my life changed completely.&ldquo;I was about to give up on my dream, but he motivated me.&ldquo;And here I am today, living my life to the fullest and expressing myself through art.&rdquo; Percy is a portrait artist from Winterveld in Mabopane, Tshwane.He is well known in his area for his &ldquo;salt art&rdquo; creations.&ldquo;I was hoping that one day I could meet him again and tell him how he influenced me, but I guess it is too late for that now,&rdquo; said Percy.After learning of Joe&rsquo;s death, Percy created a portrait of Joe at his home on Sunday. The unique portrait is made out of table salt, which follows a set pattern when he sprays it on a canvas.Percy said the salt artwork would only be cleaned up after Joe&rsquo;s funeral.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the least I can do to remember this legend of our country,&rdquo; said Percy. &ldquo;Salt may not mean much to most people, but this means a lot to me. This is my tribute to the man who changed my life.&rdquo;Joe died on Sunday after he was involved in a car accident on the M1 North between the Oxford and Houghton Road off-ramps in Joburg.
