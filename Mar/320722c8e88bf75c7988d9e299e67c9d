A BANGLADESHI man and his family are living in fear after he was shot on two occasions.Solaiman Mohammed (42), from Ehrlich Park, Mangaung said he was first shot on 21 January while sitting in his car. Then he was shot again on 21 February on a piece of land he uses in Khayelitsha, Mangaung.He has cheated death twice but has no idea why people want to kill him.&ldquo;The attackers didn&rsquo;t try to rob me.&ldquo;The first shooting happened when I was going to the casino with my wife. &ldquo;A car approached us at the robots and a man pulled out a gun. My wife got out of the car and ran away. They didn&rsquo;t follow her, they were only looking for me. I was shot three times. The one man said: &lsquo;The dog is dead.&rsquo;&rdquo;With the second shooting in Khayelitsha, two men came into the yard and without saying a word fired at Solaiman. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the attackers are. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have enemies,&rdquo; he said.His wife, Anna Mohammed (38), said they are too scared to go to work or take their kids to school. Lieutenant-Colonel Thandi Mbambo said: &ldquo;Cases of attempted murder were opened and no arrests have been made. Solaiman must go to the police station and ask the commander for protection.&rdquo;
