SHE&rsquo;S the Queen of Gqom music &ndash; and Babes Wodumo&rsquo;s pain was allegedly unbearable when she didn&rsquo;t win a Metro FM Award.Several Sunday Sun sources claim Babes Wodumo (real name Bongekile Simelane) sobbed uncontrollably when the winner was announced in the last award, for which she&rsquo;d been nominated. The first source alleged that Durban ICC staff members had to calm her and her dancers. They were said to be crying hysterically. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t believe all her hard work wasn&rsquo;t recognised. Her song was a party anthem and was playing on Metro FM, but she didn&rsquo;t win a single award. We don&rsquo;t blame her for breaking down, it was unfair,&rdquo; the source said. Another showbiz mole claimed: &ldquo;She was wailing! She sobbed that this was the second time she&rsquo;d been robbed of an award. &ldquo;Babes said last year she lost in the same manner to Mroza Fakude, who won the SABC Song of the Year. &ldquo;She was tipped off that things were going to be different at the Metros &ndash; but nothing happened.&rdquo; A third source said: &ldquo;She said she wants nothing that will associate her with the ANC or Mabala Noise&rsquo;s events because they failed to honour her. She kept on saying &lsquo;Bagwazile laba, ayikho lento bayenzayo&rdquo; (They bribed, they don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing).&rdquo; Babes was nominated in four categories at the Metro FM Awards: Song of the Year, Best Female Album, Best Dance Album and Best New Artist. When contacted by the SunTeam, Babes refused to comment, and referred us to her PR manager, Melody Mhlongo. Melody asked that an email be sent to her, but had not responded at the time of going to press
