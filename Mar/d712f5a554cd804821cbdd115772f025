MZANSI&rsquo;S Under-20 national team coach, Thabo Senong, reckons his charges&rsquo; 4-3 defeat by Senegal in the Under-20 Youth Africa Cup of Nations could be a blessing in disguise. This ahead of their final group B match.Amajita suffered their first defeat on their second game on Thursday, when they lost 4-3 to the Young Lions of Teranga in Zambia.&nbsp; Today, Senong's charges will be up against Sudan, who are bottom of Group B, at the National Heroes Stadium, in Lusaka. Kick-off is at 3pm. This is a do-or-die encounter for Amajita as they need to get maximum points to secure a place in the semi-finals and qualify for the World Cup in South Korea. Senong will need to put some more work into his defence to ensure they don&rsquo;t repeat the mistakes they made in their last match, conceding goals from set pieces. Group B is still open for all the teams as table toppers Senegal have four points, one point ahead of Amajita and Cameroon, who are second and third respectively, tied on three points. Sudan has one point. Senong knows what to do in order to qualify. Said Senong: &ldquo;We must remain positive after what happened.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sudan are another tough opponent, we need to put in extra effort and prepare well.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lesson has happened at the right time, as it will help us to focus more and behave better in the last match. &ldquo;The young boys will always make mistakes, but these are part of the learning curve for them,&rdquo; he said. In Group A, host nation Zambia have already booked their spot in the semi-finals.They were the first African side to qualify for the Under-20 World Cup, which is scheduled to be played off in South Korea later on this year.
