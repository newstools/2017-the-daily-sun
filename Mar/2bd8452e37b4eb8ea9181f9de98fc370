IT HAS been proved that visible policing reduces crime. And now Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has 111 more Metro cops to help make the municipality safer. The newly trained Metro police officers took their oath of office on Wednesday during their passing out parade, held at the Traffic College in Greenbushes, Port Elizabeth. However, the new recruits will not be thrown into the firing line yet. Their main focus for now will be on traffic and municipal by-law enforcement. Chief of the Metro police, Yolanda Faro, said the new cops would not be going to the northern parts of the metro yet, because they had not yet been properly trained for those areas. &ldquo;We will be providing police with backup for the moment. Once we are comfortable to send them to high- crime areas alone, they will go,&rdquo; said Faro. Metro head of safety and security John Best said the Metro police&rsquo;s two precincts each had to serve 30 wards. One precinct works from Uitenhage and the other from Bloemendal. Best said if the budget allowed for it, they hoped to increase the force by another 100 officers over the next three years. Mayor Athol Trollip said: &ldquo;Metro police will focus on areas facing massive crime challenge, such as Central, Uitenhage, Despatch and Motherwell.&rdquo;
