WHEN COPS stormed into Martin Sikhosana&rsquo;s (58) house he apparently went to sit on the veranda and waited. They allegedly did not find what they were looking for, it was claimed that they questioned Martin. Today, Martin, from Manaleni near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga, is dead. Resident Lettie Mashiyane claimed cops stormed the house looking for dagga. When they did not find anything, they went to Martin and slammed him to the ground. She claimed he was pepper sprayed in the face. &ldquo;They left him lying there after they were certain he did not know anything. &ldquo;I was watching from a distance but the pepper spray got to me too. Martin was so badly affected by the spray he started vomiting. They did not care about him. &ldquo;One cop told me I should drink water, get some fresh air and I would be fine. &ldquo;What about Martin? Both cops were laughing as he carried on coughing and choking,&rdquo; she claimed.Martin&rsquo;s daughter, Anna Sikhosana (28), said her dad complained of chest pain for two days. On Monday, he could not go to work, so she arranged to take him to the clinic. But he died before they could go. &ldquo;We want answers,&rdquo; she said. Brigadier Leonard Hlathi said the family must urgently speak to the cluster commander in the area. He said he had arranged a meeting with the family to discuss the matter.
