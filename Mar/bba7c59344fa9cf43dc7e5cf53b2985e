OUPA Maseko fled from his home last May and vows he will never go back. This is because the 54-year-old from extension 5 in Soshanguve, Tshwane, believes his tenants performed a ritual to cast a spell on him. He said his problems started when he went to train as a sangoma and left his niece in charge of his house. When he returned, he found she had rented it out to strangers. &ldquo;The new tenants used my house as a spaza, which they also slept in,&rdquo; he said. Oupa said strange things started happening soon after he had returned home.&ldquo;I would wake up at night after having nightmares and hear many voices in the tenants&rsquo; room. It sounded like they were having a meeting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knocked on the door once and found the room full of their friends. They told me they were performing traditional rituals.&rdquo; He started feeling uncomfortable in his home and one afternoon found what looked like coconuts buried in the back yard. &ldquo;Moments later, my foot sank into a hole,&rdquo; he said. After that Oupa decided enough is enough, and he moved out. &ldquo;I feared for my life. I didn&rsquo;t understand these people&rsquo;s rituals and thought they might end up doing something to me,&rdquo; he said. The SunTeam contacted one of Oupa&rsquo;s tenants, who gave his name only as Ahmed. He said they had performed rituals, but he denied knowing Oupa. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said the tenants performed the ritual in Oupa&rsquo;s yard to chase him away. &ldquo;He must consult a very strong sangoma who can performing a cleansing ceremony,&rdquo; said the sangoma.
