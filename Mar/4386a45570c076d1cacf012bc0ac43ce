&ldquo;IF THE emergency services had responded to our call, maybe my brother would still be alive.&rdquo; These were the chilling words of Zodwa Nonyane (37) from Block XX in Soshanguve, north of Tshwane.Zodwa&rsquo;s brother, Nkosinathi Nonyane (45), died on Sunday. Zodwa said Nkosinathi had gone to a tavern on Saturday, where he enjoyed himself and danced the night away with his friends until morning. &ldquo;He was brought home by one of his friends as he&rsquo;d had too much to drink,&rdquo; she said. Zodwa said her brother had spent the entire Sunday sleeping and they had gone to check on him at about 9pm. &ldquo;I tried to wake him up but he was not responding. I got worried and immediately called an ambulance. As I was explaining to the emergency services consultant what had happened, he just became rude and told me that &ldquo;O thutse block,&rdquo; meaning he&rsquo;d drunk over the limit. He didn&rsquo;t send the ambulance,&rdquo; she claimed.Six hours later, Zodwa said she went to ask for help at the police station. &ldquo;It is only then that an ambulance arrived but it was too late. Nkosinathi had already died.&rdquo; Now Zodwa said she will not rest until the consultant who answered the phone is traced and brought to book.Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman Johan Pieterse said the matter will be investigated.
