TUPPERWARE never goes out of fashion.People love it so much they are willing to buy it from anyone. And last Friday cops found a man selling suspected stolen Tupperware on the street.The police said they questioned the man about the items, but he could not give them a straight answer. Instead, he claimed he was selling the products for someone else in return for a commission. The police&rsquo;s Captain Solomon Sibiya said when they demanded that the suspect produce proof of ownership, he took them to his house in Kagiso, Mogale City. When they arrived there he went to his room, pretending to look for documents from his employer. But he never returned. When the cops checked they realised he had climbed out the window. The police then raided his room and found a number of suspected stolen items under his bed. These included car, house and gate keys, wrist watches, starter packs, binoculars and CDs. The suspect&rsquo;s sister was shocked to find some of her clothing under his bed. She said she had always wondered where they had disappeared to.Captain Sibiya appealed to any member of the public who has had any of the listed items stolen to open a case. The cops were searching for the suspect and asked members of the community with information about his whereabouts to call 011 696 9059.
