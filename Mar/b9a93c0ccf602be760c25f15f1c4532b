GARETH Bale&rsquo;s Wales hope to recapture the spirit of Euro 2016 in their World Cup qualifying campaign against Ireland in Dublin tonight.Having stunned Europe by reaching the semifinals of last year&rsquo;s European Championship in France, Wales trail group leaders Ireland by four points after four games.However, whereas Ireland have suffered injuries and suspensions, Wales are at full strength, with Real Madrid talisman Bale fit and firing following a spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury.&ldquo;We are a very good team when we&rsquo;re at our best and at our strongest,&rdquo; said coach Chris Coleman. &ldquo;We need these players on the pitch consistently and we&rsquo;re in pretty good condition. &ldquo;The squad might have looked different two or three months ago but we&rsquo;ve got players back. I&rsquo;ve picked those who have been on the front foot and are most ready for this challenge.&rdquo;With only the top team in each group guaranteed to qualify for next year&rsquo;s tournament in Russia, Wales desperately need to get back to winning ways at the Aviva Stadium. &ndash; AFP
