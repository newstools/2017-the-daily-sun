SENEGAL came from two goals down to beat Amajita 4-3 in their second Group B Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations played at the Levy Mwanawasa Stadium in Ndola, Zambia, last night.Thabo Senong&rsquo;s men started well when Amajita took the lead just a minute into the match through Liam Jordan&rsquo;s header.The return of captain Tercious Malepe increased the lead to 2-0 after connecting with Luther Singh&rsquo;s cross on the left flank.Amajita went into the break leading 2-0 but the Senegalese were saving the best for last. Four minutes into the second half, Ibrahima Ndiaye pulled one back for Senegal to up the pressure before 17-year-old Diagne levelled matters in the 53rd minute and completed his brace on the hour mark to take the lead. Kreppin Diatta drilled the final nail into the South Africans&rsquo; coffin after some scrappy defending. But Singh reduced the deficit to 4-3 in the 80th minute after a solo move to record his fourth goal of the tournament.Now Amajita must win Sunday&rsquo;s final group match against Sudan at the National Heroes Stadium in Lusaka if they are to secure a place in the 21st edition of the Fifa Under-20 World Cup to be held in South Korea on 20 May to 11 June. But they must also hope Cameroon defeat Senegal on Sunday for them to finish as group winners.The return of captain Malepe, Phakamani Mahlambi and Jordan seem to have added more firepower to the side, as their combination with Singh made the South Africans tick but they lost composure at the end.
