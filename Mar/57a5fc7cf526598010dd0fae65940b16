JOSEPH &ldquo;Tight&rdquo; Molangoane says he is happy to have scored in his first Soweto derby when Kaizer Chiefs drew 1-1 with Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Molangoane started on the right wing in his first derby and delivered the icing on the cake, finishing from close range in the 33rd minute following an assist from Bernard Parker.The PSL confirmed yesterday that Bucs&rsquo; equaliser was a Tsepo Masilela own-goal and has been credited by match officials as such.&ldquo;I am very happy, especially scoring in a game of this magnitude where everyone is watching,&rdquo; said the 28-year-old midfielder from Alexandra.&ldquo;Obviously I would have wanted us to get the win but we played well as a team and showed our fans how much we wanted to win this game.&ldquo;We are playing good football. Unfortunately we could not put the game away when we had the chance to, but we played well. That is important for us going forward.&rdquo;The Chiefs midfielder backs teammate Willard Katsande to bounce back after his penalty miss against the Sea Robbers. After several successful attempts, this was Katsande&rsquo;s first missed penalty kick for Amakhosi in an official game.But Tight doesn&rsquo;t believe the miss will affect the hard-tackling midfielder and is confident he will be back on the goal trail sooner rather than later.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a top player and top players bounce back,&rdquo; Molangoane said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if he scores a few in his next few games. I thought he played well in the game, he was just unlucky with the penalty. It is one of those things. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bounce back, I&rsquo;m sure. He has the character and strength to come through it and play well.&rdquo;Amakhosi are back in action on Saturday when they travel to the Mother City to take on NFD outfit Stellenbosch FC in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at Athlone Stadium.
