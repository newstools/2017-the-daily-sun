THE Constitutional Court must determine who slept on the
job, ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa said from the side-lines of the Sassa
court case today.The ConCourt is currently hearing an application by Black
Sash for the court to exercise oversight over the process to find a new social
grants payment provider.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has so far
failed to provide details about the proposed extension of the invalid grants
distribution contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsu156eyKjyIwqGoUL1pe2CJVRySkgoTgTXtrcGOTTo0N2u8LulmsuLA5pHgwHGE0NUzTdIK8CUf12EzotBE6X9OTUQgrx9Ih_PBp-ytPnDNQWuWigAXLB52BTNowuzP-2cC0lNiXsaUN6MkX4zoPZ4Fc4VGy7OEEk-gNyqxaXDYZnrS2trKUI08VqUctjW_6J4qjFz9JzONCHuZkd4yNwi1JbTsg3gMu59gOKTE8VXvC-qizfPiGNXKfRr74F2jRrVj_xUMkqrdcPjTW16icDgAJ-W-uvc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAj6v-Aio6j6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

slept on the job," Kodwa said.When asked if Dlamini should be held responsible for the
crisis at Sassa, Kodwa said many players were involved and the public should
not pre-empt the court's decisions."The fundamental question which this court cannot
answer is: What did we do or what did we not do to have arrived at this
precipitous and perpendicular point? That is the question the leadership must
ask," he said.Kodwa said the Sassa debacle could have been handled
sooner and within the confines of the law."The important question for the leadership in
government and within the State [is] what did we do or didn't do to arrive at
this precipitous and perpendicular point?" asked ANC national spokesman
Zizi Kodwa.Political pressure has been increasing on Social
Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini with opposition parties and other
organisations calling for her to resign or be fired. In 2013 the Constitutional Court ruled that the contract
with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) was illegal and invalid. It suspended the
order of invalidity until March 31 this year when the contract expires.In 2015 the grants agency told the court that it would
take over the payment of grants after its tender process failed to attract
compliant service providers.It is unclear how 17 million grant beneficiaries will be
paid on 1 April after negotiations with CPS were halted by a ministerial task
team which rejected an agreement reached in principle by Sassa and CPS."This issue could have and should have been dealt
with much better early [on], within the law," Kodwa told News24.Dlamini and Sassa's legal team were asked by the
Constitutional Court justices why they failed to inform the court timeously
that they would not be able to take over the payment of grants. They had
received legal opinion to approach the court in terms of their predicament last
year, but only reported to the court early this year.The ANC said it is concerned that the situation has now
created unnecessary panic and anxiety among the most vulnerable and
marginalised members of society."President [Jacob] Zuma and the minister of finance
have assured all social grant beneficiaries that they will be paid on 1 April
and there is sufficient money," said Kodwa.Â http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/concourt-must-determine-who-slept-on-the-job-zizi-kodwa-20170315
