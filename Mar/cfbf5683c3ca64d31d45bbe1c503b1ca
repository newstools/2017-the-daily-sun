TWO cops were killed and one was wounded during a domestic dispute on Wednesday!&nbsp; The tragedy happened in the CBD of Kimberley, Northern Cape, after a couple had a fight at a police station.&nbsp; The suspect demanded to talk to his cop wife, who had a protection order against him, but he was removed from the station by officers.&nbsp; The police followed him when he left, as he had a gun.&nbsp; The suspect ended up shooting at them in the middle of town. Colonel Athlenda Mathe, a police spokeswoman, said: &ldquo;The wife, who is also a police officer, had a protection order against the suspect.
