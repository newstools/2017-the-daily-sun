STUDENTS&rsquo; hopes of getting their year off to a solid start were dashed when Umfolozi TVET College in Eshowe campus, northern KZN, closed down yesterday. The sudden closure followed violent student protests on Wednesday. Students were told to leave residences before the end of the day after campus management suspended all lectures and tests. College spokesman Bhekani Ndlovu told Daily Sun they were still unsure as to why students were protesting. He said the protesting students only carried placards stating, &ldquo;Demand R1 000&rdquo;. Two offices, a car, the windows of some buildings and several car tyres were vandalised or burnt. He said management had not yet decided when the campus would reopen. He added that students who were writing national exam papers were allowed in test rooms provided they could produce the relevant documents. SRC president Sbu Mhlongo said he was aware that some students had problems with food and transport allowances. He said they were also caught off guard by the sudden protest and vandalism of campus property, which he condemned. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokeswoman, said a group of about 500 students had set fire to offices in the administration building and smashed windows at other buildings. She confirmed that vehicles were damaged and set alight. &ldquo;A case of arson and malicious damage to property was opened at Eshowe cop shop for investigation. No arrests have been made yet,&rdquo; said Mbhele.
