A DEATH in the family is always devastating, but no one should have to watch a loved one&rsquo;s body lying in the rain for hours without getting help. This is what happened to a family from Inanda, north of Durban in the early hours of yesterday morning! The family of a motorbike driver who was hit and killed by a taxi at about 4am had to wait in the rain for six hours before the body was removed. Relatives of the victim couldn&rsquo;t take the body to the mortuary in their private car, as police didn&rsquo;t pitch up on the scene until 7am. The Metro cops, who were first on the scene, allegedly went to a nearby police station to ask police to take over and call the mortuary van. But they were told the station&rsquo;s only van was at Phoenix Hospital.At the scene, the victim&rsquo;s furious relatives said the cops were making a mockery of their loss. The family, however, refused to speak to the media. The incident caused a traffic jam on the M25 highway as cars had trouble passing the scene. Witnesses said the Metro cops were on the scene shortly after the accident occurred. &ldquo;The family waited several hours for the cops to arrive, which made them very angry. I would also be upset if a loved one was left lying on the road in the rain for hours.&rdquo; KZN cops spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that the incident. He said according to Inanda police, there are enough vehicles that are deployed in their policing area, which means that there are enough resources to attend to complaints.
