FOR nine years, Salome Laka believed her man when he said his 4-5 wasn&rsquo;t working.&nbsp; Then a few weeks ago, the 43-year-old wife made a shocking discovery.&nbsp; Her man&rsquo;s 4-5 was, in fact, working like a well-oiled machine, but only with another woman!&nbsp; And, claimed Salome, he had even made his nyatsi pregnant. Heartbroken Salome &ndash; who is from Tladistad, North West &ndash; said what saddened her most was that her husband didn&rsquo;t even show remorse for what he did.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been good to this man. I stayed in this sexless marriage trying to build it, yet this is what I get in return,&rdquo; said Salome.&nbsp; &ldquo;He admitted to having an affair with the woman, but doesn&rsquo;t want to come clean whether he maintains a child or not.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been a fool for love and I don&rsquo;t have children because of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t ever tell me when his 4-5 was up so we could try making our own baby. What is a marriage without kids?&rdquo;&nbsp; Salome said she suspected the nyatsi was using muthi on her husband to make his 4-5 work.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should his 4-5 work on her but not on me? I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have tried to take my husband to sangomas for help with his erection, but his 4-5 remained weak.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took a vow that I&rsquo;d stay in this marriage, even when things were tough. He should have told me he wasn&rsquo;t interested in having sex with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Husband Kgowa Laka admitted to being in a relationship with another woman, but denied fathering a child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen to nonsense like that,&rdquo; he said, before hanging up.&nbsp; Daily Sun spoke to nyatsi Francina Selowa, who said Salome should get a life. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going around saying nasty things about me,&rdquo; Selowa said.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make her pay.&rdquo;&nbsp;
