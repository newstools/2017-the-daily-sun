SUPERSPORT United and Baroka FC are both on missions this season which have the potential of defining their Absa Premiership campaigns. Their missions could end in tears or wild celebrations come end of the season. The Tshwane giants are on a big mission to win the Premiership title, while the Limpopo based rookies are in a battle to survive relegation. It&rsquo;s been seven years since Matsatsantsa a Pitori last won the league title and many have tipped them to go all the way and end their drought this season. The very same bookmakers are also tipping Bakgaga to be relegated. SuperSport and Baroka are on opposite ends of the log table but will both be gunning for the three points when they clash at Mbom&shy;- bela Stadium on Saturday (3pm). SuperSport skipper Clayton Daniels said it would be suicidal to underestimate the struggling Limpopo based outfit. Baroka are at the bottom of the table with 15 points from 21 games, while Matsatsantsa are third with 37 points from 20 games. Daniels insists the rookies remain a dangerous outfit, saying his side would tread carefully. &ldquo;Our squad is good enough to handle the pressure of pushing for the league title. We won&rsquo;t take Baroka for granted and will push for the three points.&rdquo; Matsatsantsa are competing on three fronts &ndash; in the league, the Nedbank Cup and Caf Confederation Cup. They have a hectic schedule but Daniels says coach Stuart Baxter knows how to keep the legs fresh. Daniels said: &ldquo;We want to win every competition we take part in and we are not prioritising any of them. The coach told us to focus on one game at a time and that&rsquo;s what we are doing.&rdquo; Baroka played to a thrilling 2-2 draw with Kaizer Chiefs in their previous game, while Matsatsantsa recorded a 1-1 draw against Orlando Pirates.
