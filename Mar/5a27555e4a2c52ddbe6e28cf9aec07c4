MAMELODI Sundowns youngsters Musawenkosi Mdluli (18) and Malebogo Modise (18) are hoping that the Netherlands tour will be the spark that helps them further their already promising careers.These two exciting players were part of Downs&rsquo; Under-17 setup when the team won the Gothia Cup in China and finished second in an international 10-team tournament in Osaka, Japan, last year under the guidance of Godfrey Sapula. When they returned from Japan and China, Mdluli and Modise were promoted to the MultiChoice Diski Challenge team and featured on several occasions this past season.With the South African Under-20 national team having qualified for the Fifa U-20 World Cup in South Korea set to run from 20 May until 11 June, the duo hope to catch coach Thabo Senong&rsquo;s attention to be considered for the squad heading to Korea. The 18-year-old Modise, who is a wing-back, is not a newcomer to international competition as he has played for the national Under-17s and Amajita.He said: &ldquo;I would love to form part of the U-20 side for the World Cup. Being part of the MDC team has given me enough exposure and I&rsquo;ve been part of junior national teams in the past.&ldquo;I have also played in Caf competitions with the Under-17s,&rdquo; he stated his case. &ldquo;I believe now is the time for another challenge and another experience. I hope coach Senong will consider me for his squad again.&rdquo;Modise was called up for the Africa U-20 Cup of Nations tournament in Zambia but Downs declined the call-up.Mdluli said he had learnt a lot since getting promoted to the MDC: &ldquo;Playing for the national team is everyone&rsquo;s dream. I&rsquo;m waiting patiently for such an opportunity. If it comes I will grab it with both hands.&rdquo;
