SHOCKING footage has emerged of a man chest-deep in his grave &ndash; that he&rsquo;s been forced to dig himself. According to TMG Digital, the footage of the suspected thief being moered by residents was taken in Dwarsloop village in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga yesterday by Tumelo Dibakwane. The man has apparently been beaten up twice in the past by residents because they suspect him of breaking into homes, according to the report. This time, gatvol residents were apparently preparing to send him to his death, either by burying him alive, or by burning him. &ldquo;Someone was suggesting they put petrol on him and burn him. If the police were late by five minutes&sbquo; they had the petrol&sbquo; someone managed to get petrol. The garage was just a few metres away&sbquo;&rdquo; Dibakwane was quoted as saying. Mpumalanga SAPS spokesman Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said the man hadn&rsquo;t wanted to open a case and was in hospital recovering from his injuries. &ldquo;The police condemn such behaviour where people take the law into their own hands. We urge people to follow the right procedure&sbquo; should they suspect someone of being involved in criminal activity,&rdquo; said Sedibe.
