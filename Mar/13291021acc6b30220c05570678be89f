BATHABILE Dlamini has not admitted to any crisis. She simply insists that the grants of over 17 million people will be paid.But opposition parties, concerned organisations and trade unions are speaking with one voice: the minister of social development must go!At a media briefing at the Government Communication and Information System offices in Tshwane yesterday, the minister side-stepped questions about a clash between her department and Treasury.She refused to answer questions about the shock resignation of Director General Zane Dangor this Friday, or the whereabouts of CEO Thokozani Magwaza, who is reportedly on &ldquo;sick leave&rdquo;.Scolding the media, Dlamini said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to respond to questions from people who want to impose themselves on us. If people want to ask questions they can ask them, but the nuances and everything that follows the suggestions are not helping all of us.&rdquo;Yesterday political parties joined Cosatu&rsquo;s call for the firing or resignation of the minister.&ldquo;Dlamini must go and go now,&rdquo; said the DA&rsquo;s shadow minister for social development, Bridget Masango.&ldquo;The DA is both shocked and angered by the minister&rsquo;s failure to table a clear plan to resolve this crisis.&rdquo; The SACP&rsquo;s spokesman, Alex Mashilo, said their party had discussed the matter of social grants and concluded that it was one of the looming crises that was not attended to for apparently factional reasons.Mashilo said: &ldquo;The department of social development has not given compelling reasons why it was not ready to dispense social grants lawfully since 2014.&rdquo;Bantu Holomisa of the United Democratic Movement said Dlamini&rsquo;s resignation should have happened long ago.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;She should have been expelled long ago. Her department is defying a court order. We know she won&rsquo;t be fired because she is campaigning for the former wife of Zuma.&rdquo;Cope spokesman Dennis Bloem said the arrogance of the minister is a signal that the country is in serious trouble.Bloem said Cope was very disappointed that Dangor had resigned before telling the country the truth about the Sassa saga. &ldquo;Cope expected that Minister Dlamini would have resigned, not Dangor,&rdquo; said Bloem.He also said Cope was not surprised by the minister&rsquo;s defiant attitude towards the constitutional judgement because she has learnt it from her boss, Jacob Zuma.Yesterday Dlamini said they can&rsquo;t afford to be distracted from the promise made to grant beneficiaries.&ldquo;We made a promise to pay the right social grant to the right person, at the right place and time. &ldquo;We will continue to pay social grants beyond 31 March. This is our singular focus and we remain committed to the vision.&rdquo; She said the agreement with Cash Paymaster Services will be signed soon.Dlamini added she is not afraid to be fired by President Jacob Zuma.&ldquo;I think we all know I did not join the ANC to be a minister. In the ANC you are appointed by the president. It should not be taken as if I am no longer a minister... it would be the end of the world.&rdquo; City Press reported yesterday that althought Social Development has reached an agreement with Cash Paymaster Services to distribute grants, Treasury will not approve the agreement if it is not within the law and allocated budget.Cash Paymaster Services&rsquo; original tender was declared invalid in 2013.In 2014 the Constitutional Court made a ruling that the contract must be terminated and a new service provider must take over from 1 April 2017.&nbsp;
