THE trouble started when an induna&rsquo;s relative accused Maria Mkhombo of being evil and torched her house before kicking her out of the village!And, as if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, Maria &ndash; from Mangweni near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga &ndash; said the induna then told her family they no longer had any rights to their land, including traditional burial rights!It is alleged the induna told Maria&rsquo;s family that if Maria kept embarrassing the villagers, they would all be kicked out.Maria claims the latest threats were made after she spoke in a radio interview about the abuse she suffered. She told listeners the induna&rsquo;s relative, Enock Bhembe, accused her of being evil. &ldquo;He set my house alight and kicked me out of the village. I fled to Mbombela, about 200km away, and got a job at a farm. But he followed me there and got me fired. &ldquo;He wants to see me dying as a beggar and buried as a pauper. My children cannot cope. I need protection from this man.&rdquo;Maria&rsquo;s mother Zodwa Mkhombo (70) and her family alleged they were called to induna Mahhawane Ngomane&rsquo;s kraal, where they were told they no longer had rights to the land. Gogo Zodwa said: &ldquo;I am old. When I die I want to be buried in the land of my birth. What&rsquo;s happening terrifies me so much.&rdquo;The induna denied that she had threatened to kick the family out. Mahhawane told Daily Sun he had asked Zodwa to get help for Maria, who she believed was mentally ill. Sergeant Gerald Sedibe said Maria should speak to the station commander about the matter.
