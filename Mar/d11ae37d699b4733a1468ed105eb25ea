THEY said they feel safer now that the robber is dead.&ldquo;He is gone for good and now we are free,&rdquo; said one resident after the body of Khulekani Myeza (26) of Nsimbini near Chesterville, Durban was found on Friday. &ldquo;Khulekani terrorised us by breaking into our houses, assaulting and robbing us of our belongings. He thought he was untouchable. We were too scared to report him to cops.&rdquo;It is alleged the dead man tried to rob a man standing at a bus stop, but the man screamed for help and the angry crowd caught Khule-kani and beat him to death.Khulekani&rsquo;s sister, Anele Myeza (29), said the family did not approve of his criminal activities.&ldquo;But he did not deserve to die like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Those people should have taken him to the police instead of killing him.&rdquo;Local councillor Mveli Mthembu said although the crime rate in the area was high, people should not take the law into their own hands. &ldquo;Residents must work with the police to fight crime. Beating someone is a crime, let alone killing them. Chesterville residents must be careful not to commit more crimes by beating thugs,&rdquo; said Mthembu.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of murder was opened for investigation at Cato Manor after an angry mob attacked a 26-year-old man with sticks and rocks. &ldquo;No one has been arrested at this stage,&rdquo; said Zwane.
