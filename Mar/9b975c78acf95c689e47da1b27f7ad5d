BAFANA Bafana caretaker coach Owen Da Gama reckons Guinea-Bissau and Angola are perfect opponents as Bafana prepare for the all-important upcoming 2018 Fifa World Cup and 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifiers. Bafana play the African Wild Dogs in their first friendly at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday (3pm).They then face Angola at Buffalo City Stadium in East London on Tuesday (7pm). Itumeleng Khune will be captain for both matches. Da Gama said the matches against these opponents would help Bafana when they face Cape Verde Island in their Group D World Cup qualifier on 2 September. Said Da Gama: &ldquo;The thinking behind playing Guinea-Bissau is that they are a former Portuguese colony. Most of their players ply their trade in the second division of the Portuguese league. That is also the case with Angola.&ldquo;These games are preparation for the World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde. &ldquo;As you know, they (Cape Verde) are a former Portuguese colony too. Most of the national team players also play in the Portuguese second division. There are many similarities between the teams. I think it was a wise choice for the association to rope in these teams.&rdquo; Bafana have a good record against Cape Verde. They have not lost any of their three outings since 2004, beating the islanders twice and drawing the other game. Da Gama added that they would need to take the friendlies seriously, as they would be the only preparations for the Cape Verde match. &ldquo;After this we have no games lined up,&rdquo; said the national Under-23 head coach. &ldquo;We have to be well-prepared when the new coach arrives.&rdquo;Da Gama guided Bafana through a practice match yesterday where they beat PSL side Golden Arrows 1-0 at a scorching King Zwelithini Stadium in Umlazi, Durban. Hlompho Kekana scored the solitary goal.
