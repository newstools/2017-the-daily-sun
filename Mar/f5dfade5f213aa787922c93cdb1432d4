JOE Hlatshwayo&rsquo;s house in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, was burnt to ashes by angry residents. But he claims he is innocent, even though the residents have accused him of involvement in criminal activities! On Saturday, the Kempton Park community took to the streets, during protests similar to the ones in Rosettenville, where residents destroyed property belonging to alleged drug dealers. But the 42-year-old claims he is innocent and is heartbroken by what has happened to him and his family. &ldquo;They burnt my house just because my friends are foreigners. They came to my house, and without warning they started breaking down the walls. &ldquo;As I was trying to make sense of what was going on, they started stoning my house. I had no choice but to run for cover. &ldquo;These people have left me and my family homeless. All my hard work has gone up in smoke. They then forced their way into my house, trashed the house, and looted my belongings. This is not justice but a criminal act.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa said no arrests have been made yet in connection with the incident. &ldquo;Order has been restored in the area and police have opened a case of malicious damage to property and public violence.&rdquo;
