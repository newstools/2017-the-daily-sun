NOXOLO Kubheka couldn&rsquo;t contain her excitement when she found out she was pregnant with a baby girl. The 20-year-old from Vryheid, in northern KZN, said she couldn&rsquo;t wait to hold her daughter but her dreams were shattered when the child died shortly after she gave birth. The baby died last week at the Lower Umfolozi War Memorial Hospital and according to hospital staff, it was because she had severe Down Syndrome.However, the grieving mum blames the nurses.&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t take care of me while I was in labour. &ldquo;They just sipped coffee and giggled. When I screamed they beat me, saying I was a nuisance,&rdquo; claimed Noxolo. &ldquo;Even when I told them the baby&rsquo;s head was out, they ignored me. &ldquo;They only rushed to my bed when they saw the doctor coming.&rdquo;KZN Department of Health spokesman Agiza Hlongwane said: &ldquo;The department needs to be given sufficient time to gather all the relevant facts. &ldquo;Sometimes the gathering of responses requires that some employees must excuse themselves from their normal duties&rdquo;.
