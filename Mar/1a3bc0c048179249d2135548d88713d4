MAMELODI Sundowns striker Anthony Laffor knows Uganda&rsquo;s Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) will be no pushovers. Downs, the defending African champions, host the Ugandan champions in the first round, first leg of the Caf Champions League at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday (7pm).Laffor, who scored in Downs&rsquo; 2-0 win over SAB League side Mariveni United at the same venue on Monday, underlined how important it is to win the home leg.Said the Liberian born striker: &ldquo;I played against this team (KCCA) when I was at SuperSport United and they took us out of the competition. They will have changed over the years but are still a very good side. &ldquo;My roommate Dennis Onyango has told me a lot about them and we need to be prepared.&rdquo;Onyango, the Ugandan international goalkeeper and Caf 2016 Player of the Year based in Africa, will miss the clash against his countrymen due to injury. He will be replaced by Wayne Sandilands.Said Laffor: &ldquo;Denis knows them and we have talked about them. The key is to score goals at home. We won the Champions League last year by scoring goals at home. &ldquo;We netted two goals in most home matches and that paved the way for our big success in Africa.&rdquo;Laffor said the goal he scored against Mariveni had helped boost his confidence: &ldquo;I had not scored for a while and needed that goal.&rdquo;The striker warned that players would need to forget last year: &ldquo;Winning the Champions League was fantastic but that is history. We need to keep our feet firmly on the ground as there is still a long way to go. We must forget what happened last year.&rdquo;Laffor said he and his teammates had the mental strength to succeed: &ldquo;That is one area where we don&rsquo;t need to worry, we are mentally strong and up for the challenge again. We have set ourselves a target of three trophies this year.&rdquo;
