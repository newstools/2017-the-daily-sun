DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane led a march to Gauteng Premier David Makhura&rsquo;s office yesterday, calling on him to to resign.Addressing the crowd, Maimane said one can judge a government by the way it protects defenceless people.&ldquo;The ANC government in Gauteng does none of those things,&rdquo; he said.Speaking about the Esidimeni tragedy, he said the Gauteng government left its most vulnerable citizens in the hands of people it knew nothing about, and then turned its back on them. Maimane said in the past, the ANC could put the blame on one offical while the rest got away without consequences.&ldquo;We saw them do this with Marikana. We saw them do this with Nkandla. We saw them do this with the Guptas&rsquo; Waterkloof landing,&rdquo; said Maimane.&ldquo;As soon as a scandal breaks, one person gets the blame and the rest walk away.&rdquo;He said the families of the Esidimeni victims deserve better. &ldquo;The resignation of MEC Qedani Mahlangu will not make the Esidimeni tragedy go away. All those responsible for the deaths must follow her example, and this begins with Makhura.&rdquo; Maimane said the premier knew about the tragedy.&ldquo;He was told as far back as November 2015 of the grave danger of moving these patients. Even after he was told of the first deaths, he did nothing.&rdquo;A vote of no confidence in Makhura failed yesterday when 37 members of the legislature voted against the motion and 29 for it.
