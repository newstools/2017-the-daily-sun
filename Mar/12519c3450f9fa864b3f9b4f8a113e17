A FIGHT over the suspension of municipal workers belonging to trade union South African Municipal Workers&rsquo; Union (Samwu) has been escalated to provincial level. This comes after it took seven months for Alfred Nzo District Municipality in Eastern Cape to conclude the matter. Members of the union have also threatened to protest as they have not been given a response to a memorandum of grievances handed to Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Fikile Xasa two weeks ago. Samwu district chairman Sihlahla&nbsp;Nozigqwaba told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We delivered our petition to the office of the MEC but we still haven&rsquo;t heard a word from him. &ldquo;We are contacting the office of the premier and will protest if nothing happens. We are tired of waiting. &ldquo;We want answers regarding our jobs at the municipality.&rdquo; He said they wanted the provincial government to intervene in the matter because they suspected the municipality had not handled the issue properly. The workers were suspended last July, and this was followed by a month-long protest outside the municipal building in Emaxesibeni against the termination of more than 300 expanded public works programme contracts.When the frustrated workers handed over their petition to the MEC&rsquo;s spokesman, Mamkeli Ngam, he promised it would be studied by the MEC and workers would get a response. Municipal spokesman Lubabalo Majenge said: &ldquo;The municipality can confirm that 10 employees were suspended with pay in July. A disciplinary process with the first group is in its final stage and we cannot comment further.&rdquo;
