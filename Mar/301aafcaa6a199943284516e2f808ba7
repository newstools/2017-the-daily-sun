MAMELODI Sundowns resumed the CAF Champions League defence off to a good start following their convincing 2-1 victory against Kampala Capital City Authority FC (KCCA) in their first leg tier at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Friday night.Sundowns looked for sure like a team that had done its homework before the clash against the Ugandan side. They controlled the game from the whistle go, scoring two quick goals. It was the first meeting between the two clubs. Bangaly Soumahoro broke the deadlock in the third minutes into the game with a header.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t take them long when Brazilians doubled the score few minutes later from the penalty spot after Thapelo Morena was brought down inside the box. Ricardo Nascimento stood up to convert the penalty to make it 2-0 for Sundowns.Coach Pitso Mosimane made 10 changes to his squad that played against Mariveni United in the Last 32 of the Nedbank Cup on Monday, only Leonardo Castro a his place. Rising star Morena, who was snubbed to represent Bafana Bafana later this month made his Champions League debut.Goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands went to the break untested. However, the Kampala came gun blazing in the second stanza and their hard work finally paid off in the 69th minute when former Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic striker Geoffrey Sarankuma netted to make the score 2-1. Kampala might have lost the game but they have an away goal that could come handy when they play the second leg next weekend at home. &nbsp;
