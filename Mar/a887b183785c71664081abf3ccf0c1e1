MELUSI Nkosi (32) from Tshepisong, Soweto claims his ex-girlfriend is making his life a living hell. Melusi says Ntabeleng Miaketsu (30) has gone out of her way to make sure his relationship with his current girlfriend, Mpoetsi Lesoela (30), doesn&rsquo;t have peace. Melusi said he met his ex in 2007 while she was unemployed and he worked at a petrol station. &ldquo;She moved in with me but when I lost my job things went sour. She found a job and started to sleep out regularly. She would tell me she was working late.&rdquo; He ended their relationship in 2014 after he learned Ntabeleng had been cheating on him. &ldquo;She moved in with her new man at Snake Park.&rdquo; Melusi said last year he met Mpoetsi and they moved in together. &ldquo;But that did not sit well with Ntabeleng. She vandalises our home and even beats us up every time she sees us. Last week she stabbed me and even tried to pour boiling water on me,&rdquo; he alleged. Melusi said they have opened several cases against her but she always gets away with it. Ntabeleng didn&rsquo;t want to comment on the accusation that she assaulted the couple, but accused Mpoetsi of being a home wrecker. &ldquo;She has been after my man for years now. &ldquo;If she thinks she has won him she has another think coming.&rdquo; SAPS spokesman Aubrey Moopeloa said a case of assault has been opened and police are investigating.
