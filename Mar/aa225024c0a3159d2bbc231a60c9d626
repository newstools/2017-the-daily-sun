A GRADE 1 pupil went back to school yesterday after spending more than a week in terror at home.The six-year-old&rsquo;s mum is furious because her son said he was beaten by one of his teachers. The 27-year-old mum from Nongoma, northern KZN, said her son had bruises all over his body last Wednesday, apparently because a teacher was unhappy with &ldquo;unclear writing&rdquo; in his workbook. The worried mum told Daily Sun she was furious. &ldquo;He has been refusing to go to school since the incident,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He cries each time we wake him up so he can go to school.&rdquo;The mum said she tried to find a solution, but that the principal has not been helpful. &ldquo;My mum went to the school the day after the incident. &ldquo;The principal promised to call my son and the teacher to his office to get more details about the incident but this never happened.&rdquo; She said she felt as if the school didn&rsquo;t care about what had happened to her child. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN police spokesman, said a case of common assault was opened. &ldquo;A 57-year-old suspect was arrested and appeared in the Nongoma Magistrates Court. The case was remanded to 10 April.&rdquo; The school principal told the SunTeam he was not allowed to comment. &ldquo;The law doesn&rsquo;t allow me to give you details.&rdquo; Kwazi Mthethwa, KZN education department spokesman, said they condemned corporal punishment. &ldquo;We urge the parent to approach the circuit office so we can start an investigation.&rdquo;
