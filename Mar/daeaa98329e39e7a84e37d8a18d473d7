MULTICHOICE Diski Challenge (MDC) scoring whizkid, Tshegofatso Mabasa, could be the answer to Bloemfontein Celtic first team&rsquo;s inability to find the back of the net.This as the top goal-scorer in the division was one of the most influential players in Celtic&rsquo;s reserves this season, netting 12 goals in 11 games.Celtic first team&rsquo;s struggle before rival goal posts has placed it fourth from the bottom of the log table.But the 20-year-old striker, with loads of flair and poise in the 18th area, is dying for an opportunity to help his club avoid relegation. Said Mabasa: &ldquo;Now that the MDC season is done and dusted, my focus is to form part of the first team.&ldquo;At the moment, things are not going so well for it, and one of the challenges is scoring goals. Given a chance, I will give it my all to make sure that I contribute towards making my club great. And this means scoring a lot of goals during this season.&rdquo;And Mabasa is unfazed by challenges and intense pressure of playing for the first team. He told SunSport: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tasted playing for the first team, and competition is tough.&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m up for the challenge. In essence, my target is to score five goals in the remaining games.&rdquo;In the MDC, Mabasa had surpassed last season&rsquo;s top goal-scorer, Emmanuel Letlotlo of Kaizer Chiefs, who found the back of the net nine times.Highlands Park&rsquo;s Muzi Thabotha scored 10, while Orlando Pirates&rsquo; Grant Peters, Sundowns&rsquo; Keletso Makgalwa and Free State Stars&rsquo; Thabo Maphakisa each blitzed in only eight goals this season.
