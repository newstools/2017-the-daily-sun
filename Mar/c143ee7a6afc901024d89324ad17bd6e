THE PREMIER Soccer League (PSL) has finally charged Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates for the pitch invasion that erupted at Loftus Versfeld on 11 February.Both clubs will appear before the PSL&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee on 9 March to answer to a number of charges arising from this disgraceful incident. The main charge against both clubs is misconduct by their supporters. Pirates fans invaded the pitch and threatened players and officials after Sundowns&rsquo; Percy Tau had scored to make it 6-0 in the 82nd minute. That goal tipped the unhappy Bucs fans over the edge and they vented their anger by rushing onto the pitch, breaking television cables and injuring other fans and photographers. In a statement released yesterday, the PSL said: &ldquo;Pirates have been charged with contravening Rule 54 of the NSL Rules arising from the conduct of their supporters at the match, after the club&rsquo;s supporters invaded the pitch, threw objects and vandalised and damaged private property during the game.&rdquo; Sundowns as the home side have also been brought to book and were charged with failure to provide adequate security measures at the match, resulting in their supporters and those of visiting club Pirates invading the pitch area, causing damage to property and throwing objects at players and officials on the pitch. The incident resulted in Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza bringing in a new coach in the form of Swedish-born Kjell Jonevret last Monday in a bid to stop the string of poor results that has seen Bucs slide down to 10th position in the Absa Premiership standings.
