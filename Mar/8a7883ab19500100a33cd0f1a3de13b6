A MOTHER in Tembisa, Ekurhu-leni, is fuming. Poppy Maluleke (28) alleges that Limpopo broadcaster Alleta Mathumba stole her man!Poppy claims Alleta, a presenter on Capricorn FM, used her connections to force her to quit her job. This after she allegedly confronted Alleta for stealing her baby daddy, Lawrence &ldquo;Lolo&rdquo; Mpunzi (31). Poppy told Sunday Sun her ordeal with Alleta started two years ago. &ldquo;I never thought there would come a day when I would have to share my private life in the media. &ldquo;But I have no choice. I&rsquo;m left with a broken heart and two kids to provide for on my own. &ldquo;I knew Alleta was involved with my baby daddy and was happy when they finally broke up two years ago.&rdquo; Poppy went on: &ldquo;I found out in January that Alleta and Lolo were back together. I tried to talk to Lolo, but he didn&rsquo;t listen. &ldquo;I called Alleta and she confessed to me. She threatened to destroy me. I asked her what I had done to deserve this. But she vowed she would deal with me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m jobless now because she called my manager and said that I had called her and she was unhappy with my conduct. &ldquo;She asked Standard Bank to fire me. I was called in by my manager and told my conduct was unacceptable and that Alleta was a public figure. &ldquo;Then in February, I resigned because the writing was on the wall that I was going to be fired. &ldquo;Lolo is no longer supporting our kids because of Alleta. Now, I&rsquo;m battling to survive with my kids because of her. &ldquo;Alleta abused her powers as a role model and a public figure,&rdquo; she said. When called for comment, Alleta said: &ldquo;The matter is with my lawyers now. Speak to Standard Bank. I think they are in a better position to clarify why she was fired.&rdquo; Lolo said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about. There is no truth in all of that. I am not going to discuss my private life with journalists. Alleta is my past.&rdquo; Standard Bank could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;
