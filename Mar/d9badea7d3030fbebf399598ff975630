GOLDEN Arrows and Maritzburg will kick off the first of their back-to-back derbies tomorrow when they do battle in the Absa Premiership at Princess Magogo Stadium in Kwa-Mashu at 6pm. The clubs meet again for their second KwaZulu-Natal derby in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 match at the same venue on 12 March. Roger de Sa still endeavours to win over all the Maritzburg fans, who felt let down by their 4-1 loss to SuperSport United on 22 February. He made some amends with a 2-1 victory over Free State Stars the following week and would like to keep their momentum going against the sharp Arrows tomorrow.KZN football fans are bound to be divided on who will be victorious at the end of the day.Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen has bemoaned his team&rsquo;s defensive errors that saw the Durban outfit concede 27 goals in 19 matches. At this stage last season Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende had let in 20 goals. Larsen said: &ldquo;My main concern is the individual errors. They have cost us in lots of games.&rdquo; Conceding too many goals could jeopardise their chances of securing a top eight spot at the end of the season. He added: &ldquo;This issue needs to be addressed. If we continue conceding goals like this, it could hurt us. The goal average could become a problem in the end.&rdquo; But it is not all gloom and doom at Arrows. The backline may be leaking goals, but the forwards are doing their fair share up-front. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende have shown improvement as far as scoring is concerned. They scored 16 goals in 19 games last season. This year, however, they scored 21 goals in 19 matches.Larsen said: &ldquo;Although we have been conceding goals, I&rsquo;m happy that we are also scoring some.&rdquo;
