MORE THAN 400 workers affiliated to Samwu gathered at the offices of the Kouga Municipality yesterday. They were holding placards in Da Gama Street, Jeffrey&rsquo;s Bay, condemning the municipality. They damaged property and dumped rubbish in the streets. The strikers are demanding an extension to the contracts of 74 Expanded Public Works Programme workers whose contracts were terminated by the municipality at the end of last month. Shop steward Clifton Booysen told Daily Sun more than 400 Samwu members were striking. He said last year the municipality agreed to extend their contracts, but employed 48 new workers to replace them. &ldquo;Now they are sitting at home without having been prepared for dismissal,&rdquo; he said. Kouga&rsquo;s Mayor Elza van Lingen said the workers&rsquo; contracts were extended from November to the end of last month. &ldquo;The programme is not meant to create permanent employment. &ldquo;It is a short-term job creation project,&rdquo; she said. Van Lingen explained the municipality did not break the law by terminating their contracts. &ldquo;What we are doing is legitimate and within the bounds of the law,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Some workers have had their contracts extended many times. &ldquo;This is unfair as we have a high unemployment rate in the area.&rdquo; Van Lingen added that the municipality would take legal action after the striking workers damaged property. She said the strikers trashed the CBD in Jeffrey&rsquo;s Bay and probably also damaged property in Hankey. Sergeant Majola Nkohli of the SAPS said he could not contact the Jeffrey&rsquo;s Bay police station commander, but Booysen confirmed that no one was arrested. &ldquo;They are at court now. They have been interdicted by the municipality to go back to work,&rdquo; said Nkohli.
