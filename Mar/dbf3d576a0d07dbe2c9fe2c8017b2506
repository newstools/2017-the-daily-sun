The pupil then asks the mother who she thinks beat up her daughter. The mother responds by addressing the group of pupils. “You can’t leave your homes to come to study but instead make fun of my child. You’re old. You’re my age.“You should be out of school by now. I’ve already completed my four years at university. You’re supposed to have finished school already but you are busy beating children. Who beat her yesterday? Come and beat her now,” she said.The pupil is heard saying she doesn’t want to beat the woman’s child again. “Why don’t you want to beat her again?” asked the mother. The pupil responded: “I’m tired of her. Why does she go around gossiping about us?” The argument continued until another woman in a red T-shirt, who had been silent until then, slapped the pupil. The pupil allegedly slapped her back. When the mother tried to hit the pupil, the pupil overpowered her and she landed on the ground with her legs in the air. Other pupils are heard reacting in shock, with one of them saying they were not aware their school mate was so strong.“She beat up both women. She was defending herself because she was scared that the two women would hurt her.” Daily Sun tried to trace the parent without any luck.Kwazi Mthethwa, KZN Department of Education spokesman, condemned the parent’s actions. “She should have reported the matter to the school. We will still investigate,” he said.
