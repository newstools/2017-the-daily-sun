A 14-YEAR-OLD school- girl was found in possession of dagga on Friday.Acting on a tip-off, Reaction Unit South Africa officers visited a high school in Verulam, north of Durban, and found the minor in possession of 24 zols.Reaction unit spokesman Prem Balram said: &ldquo;Our officers received information that the suspect was in possession of dagga and she intended selling it to other pupils.&ldquo;Acting on the information, a woman officer accompanied by a teacher from the school went to the grade 9 class. When the suspect saw the officer she quickly removed a pink pencil case from her bag and placed it on the desk of the pupil seated next to her. When the officer opened the pencil case she discovered 24 wrappings of dagga inside,&rdquo; said Balram.He said the suspect said the dagga belonged to her older sister, who was absent that particular day. &ldquo;She went on to explain that her older sister asked her to hand the pencil case to another pupil during a lunch break, who would then assist her in selling the drugs to other pupils for R5 per wrapping,&rdquo; said Balram.One of the teachers said drug use at the school remained very high. &ldquo;Attempts to clamp down on drugs are made regularly, but pupils often find new and innovative ways of smuggling them onto the school premises,&rdquo; said the teacher. KZN education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the issue of drugs in schools was troubling the department.&ldquo;We hope the suspect will reveal the name of the supplier, because we believe that an adult is behind this,&rdquo; said Mahlambi.Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;The incident was reported to the police but a case was not opened.&rdquo;
