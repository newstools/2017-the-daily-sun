My man returned late from work and found the wings and ndunu.&ldquo;He became cross and said I was undermining him. He slept in another room that night and in the morning left for work. He hasn&rsquo;t come back since.&rdquo;Daily Sun spoke to the man, who said he was tired of being disrespected. He said: &ldquo;What she did was rude.
