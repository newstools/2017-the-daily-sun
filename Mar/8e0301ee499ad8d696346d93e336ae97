MORE than 10 families were evicted from the houses they were renting from private owners at Mid-Ennerdale, close to Vereeniging, last week.Some residents were asleep and others were preparing to go to work and school when men in blue overalls invaded their homes, demanding that they move out!Resident Althea Adams (38) said that a man who claimed to be a sheriff went into her house, accompanied by two men. Outside was a van full of men. The sheriff said he had papers from the courts that we must move out, she said. Residents told Daily Sun they were renting the houses and waiting for a court date to deal with eviction threats.They were shocked to see people kicking them out already.People were left stranded, sitting in the streets surrounded by their furniture. The men in blue overalls remained behind to secure the houses and made sure no one went back in, said Althea. Daily Sun has not been able to get comment from the private owners.
