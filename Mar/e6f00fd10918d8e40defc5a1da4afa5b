SAB LEAGUE side Mariveni United hope to cause one of the biggest upsets in Nedbank Cup history when they face PSL and African champs Mamelodi Sundowns in the Last 32 tonight.Sundowns, who have not scored a goal in their last two games, will be hoping to redeem themselves when they host the little-known Limpopo-based outfit at Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight at 7.30pm. Mariveni were formed in 2007 and named after their village of Mariveni, which is outside Tzaneen.Mariveni coach Dodo Tapfumaneyi said they didn&rsquo;t want to put pressure on themselves &ndash; they were going to the game to enjoy themselves: &ldquo;This is an opportunity of a lifetime for the boys. The only thing we stress about is the low level of experience in our squad.&ldquo;We have nothing to lose. We can beat them. But I guess we&rsquo;ll take positives from any results, this is football.&rdquo;Tapfumaneyi is optimistic that they will not concede two dozen goals like Kimberley outfit Powerlines FC did back in 2012, when they were walloped 24-0.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane confirmed last week that they knew nothing about Mariveni but said he would continue rotating his squad.&ldquo;We will give a chance to players returning from injury. I&rsquo;m hoping Leonardo Castro will regain his form and score,&rdquo; added the coach.
