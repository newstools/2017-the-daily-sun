KHAMA BILLIAT&rsquo;S alleged romance with a woman he calls his stalker gives him sleepless nights.Try mentioning Beverly Sibanda (25) around the prolific Mamelodi Sundowns and Zimbabwe midfielder, and watch the often cool character turn into a raging bull &ndash; in a China shop.And Khama&rsquo;s angst has been on edge lately, especially after the Zimbabwe lass professed her love for the Mzansi Players&rsquo; Player of The Season on national radio in Harare recently.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in love, and his wife knows about it. But I can&rsquo;t say much about my love life. I don&rsquo;t know how he (Billiat) will feel about this, because the information is not for public consumption,&rdquo; Beverly told the local radio station.&ldquo;I made that statement unintentionally and don&rsquo;t want people to blow it out of proportion. It might affect his family and career.&rdquo;Although most would-be suitors may agree that Beverly is quite a hottie, her scandals aren&rsquo;t.She&rsquo;s consistently in the media for all the wrong reasons, particularly for raunchy pole dances at nightclubs, which even led to her recent arrest.Asked for comment on Beverly&rsquo;s interview, a fuming Khama (26), married to and has a three-year-old daughter, denied the affair.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurt. I don&rsquo;t know why she keeps nagging me like that,&rdquo; Khama said about Beverly, who is believed to be pregnant with a musician&rsquo;s child. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s made such claims before, and I told her to stop it. I&rsquo;m happily married and can&rsquo;t disrespect my wife like that.&rdquo;He claimed knowing Beverly through a friend: &ldquo;When they broke up, she started stalking me. I didn&rsquo;t know she had some hidden agenda.&rdquo;
