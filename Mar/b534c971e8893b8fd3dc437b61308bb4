SANGOMA Jacob Nzama says he can track stolen cars with muthi, and he is not afraid to show how he does it. The SunTeam bumped into Jacob in Mzimhlophe, Soweto, last week.He had come from Tzaneen in Limpopo to install what he calls &ldquo;Jacob tracker&rdquo; in the minibus of an old customer &ndash; a taxi boss. Unlike other sangomas, he works in broad daylight as he fears nothing . . . &ldquo;This is the instruction I got from my ancestors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They told me to do it in broad daylight, so that thieves can&rsquo;t hide when I look for them. &ldquo;Right now I&rsquo;m installing a muthi tracker in this minibus. People can see everything I&rsquo;m doing. It will be exactly like that when anyone steals it. &ldquo;The thief will be seen. He will feel exposed and haunted. We will find the car within three days.&rdquo;When Daily Sun met the sangoma, he was nearly finished. He had a bucket and he burned muthi in the minibus.&ldquo;This bucket was full of muthi that only I and my ancestors know about. I washed the whole car with it,&rdquo; he said.He said washing the car with muthi would prevent people from stealing it. &ldquo;But if it happens that thieves steal the car, the muthi burnt in the vehicle would haunt the culprits.&rdquo; Jacob said he didn&rsquo;t want to be specific about the kind of muthi he uses. He would only say that it&rsquo;s made of roots that are hard to find.He has helped many people who are happy with his services.&ldquo;Not so long ago, a guy lost his VW Golf 1. &ldquo;He and the police looked everywhere but didn&rsquo;t find it. He was referred to me by a cop I once helped. We found his car in two days.&rdquo; The taxi boss customer (56) said every time he buys a new car, he takes it to Jacob, and he has never had any problems.
