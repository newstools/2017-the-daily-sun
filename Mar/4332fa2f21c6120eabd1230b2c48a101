DEPARTMENT of Social Development Director-General, Zane Dangor, has resigned from his position.Dangor confirmed to News24 yesterday that he had tendered his resignation on Friday, saying his departure was due to a breakdown in relations between him and Minister Bathabile Dlamini.&nbsp;This was over their disagreements on South Africa Social Security Agency&rsquo;s (Sassa) legal obligations to the Constitutional Court.But Dangor refused to comment on whether he thought he had been treated fairly on the matter.Dangor was appointed director-general in November, after his predecessor left the department. But he had been special adviser to the minister before that since 2010, according to the department&rsquo;s website.The director-general could not confirm whether Dlamini had received his resignation, and department spokesperson Lumka Oliphant could not be reached for comment yesterday morning.Meanwhile, National Treasury on Friday said it could not intervene in the negotiations with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) for the extension of the distribution contract of social grants.Treasury also said the procurement responsibility had to be the responsibility of the accounting officer of the respective department, which was the director-general. But the portfolio committee on social development heard on Wednesday that acting Sassa CEO, Thamo Mzobe, had been put in charge of the three-day negotiations with CPS. &ndash; News24&nbsp;
