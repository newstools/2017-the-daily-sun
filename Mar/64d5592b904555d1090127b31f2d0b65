ALLEGATIONS of racism saw enraged parents descend on a primary school in Newlands East yesterday, forcing pupils out of their classrooms. About 50 parents claimed that a group of grade 7 pupils were being targeted by two racist teachers at Barracuda Primary School.Ntombi Ngubane (33), a parent, said: &ldquo;The teachers call our children &lsquo;monkeys&rsquo; and claim they and their parents are HIV- positive. We want those teachers to be fired.&rdquo;She said the two teachers allegedly grouped pupils according to race and taught them separately. Sfiso Ngubane (42), another parent, said his daughter had told him that one of the teachers often showed them her panties in class.&ldquo;They are not fit to be teachers. Our children are not monkeys,&rdquo; he said.Sfiso said parents had kept quiet about the matter for long enough and now they wanted to speak to the principal and other teachers. When the SunTeam arrived, a school inspector had just turned up and was trying to calm the situation. The inspector refused to talk to the media.Kwazi Mthethwa, KZN education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane&rsquo;s spokesman, urged parents to stay calm while the department dealt with the matter.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t encourage discrimination in our schools, but we also cannot condone parents and pupils taking the law into their own hands,&rdquo; Mthethwa said.They would wait for the education inspector to compile and submit a report.KZN police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said cops were called in to defuse the situation down.&ldquo;No one was assaulted and no case was opened.&rdquo;
