PROTESTING madalas, gogos and people living with disabilities want the KZN Department of Social Development to commit to continuing their monthly stipends.They also want to be moved to a safer place. The senior citizens have threatened not to leave the Nduduzweni old age home in Mlazi&rsquo;s D section if their demands are not met.This is despite being taken to the Durban High Court on Wednesday by the department&rsquo;s MEC, Weziwe Thusi.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting paid every month for doing different projects. So we want the department to continue paying us even if we are not here. &ldquo;And we want the department to move us to another centre while the Nduduzweni centre is being renovated,&rdquo; said madala Mzonjani Khubisa (68).The department took the protesters to court after they refused to leave the centre last month. The case was postponed to 13 March. Department spokeswoman Ncumisa Ndelu said: &ldquo;All these people must go back to their homes. The renovations should have started but they are delaying the process. The department has already agreed that it will continue paying them.&rdquo;
