SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter has explained that Orlando Pirates boss Kjell Jonevret faces a challenge in blending tactical discipline with freedom of expression at the club.Baxter, who enjoyed success with Kaizer Chiefs, where he appeared to help individual players thrive within a disciplined team structure, was speaking after SuperSport's 1-1 draw with Pirates on Tuesday.The 63-year-old told reporters: "I know Kjell as a colleague through training courses and meeting at games. He has a solid background and will bring structure."He'll have a tough job of balancing the need for Pirates to have structure and the South African mentality of wanting to play the ball."The Swede has had a solid start to life at Mayfair after having drawn his first three matches against Polokwane City, Chiefs and SuperSport 1-1.&nbsp;
