A SHORTAGE of student accommodation and a delay in the payment of National Student Financial Aid Scheme loans have triggered chaos. Gatvol students from the University of KZN&rsquo;s Edgewood campus in Pinetown, west of Durban, abandoned lectures yesterday to protest. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a group of about 200 students protested on campus yesterday. &ldquo;They damaged windows and threw stones at vehicles. A case of public violence was opened with Pinetown SAPS. No arrests have been made and police are on the scene to monitor the situation,&rdquo; she said. SRC president Xolani Dube said they are tired of university management ignoring them. &ldquo;We submitted a memorandum of grievances to management two weeks ago. We stated that there are not enough residence spaces,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some students live in a hotel where it is difficult to study because of the unfriendly environment. The university has to come up with a plan to buy or lease more suitable buildings.&rdquo; He said many needy students had not been paid their loans. &ldquo;They cannot afford to buy books and meals. We have a problem and the university is quiet. We&rsquo;ve suggested that the university pays for these students and then takes the money back when the aid scheme pays,&rdquo; he said. University spokeswoman Indumathie Moodley promised to send a statement to the SunTeam but had not responded to questions by late yesterday afternoon. Kagisho Mamabolo from the aid scheme said he was overseas and referred the SunTeam to the media office. However, the office had not responded to questions by the time of going to print.
