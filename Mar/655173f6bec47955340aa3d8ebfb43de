Eastern Cape minnows EC Bees will feel they are living the dream when they host Orlando Pirates in a Nedbank Cup last 32 match at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Sunday.The game is scheduled for a 3pm kick off.Only formed in 2013, this is EC Bees's second time in the Nedbank Cup, having lost 3-2 to Magesi FC in the last 32 in 2016.Coached by Chippa Jongo, EC Bees play in the Eastern Cape stream of the Second Division (third tier) and would have had to go through a series of qualifying games to reach the last 32.Originally from rural Tsolo, EC Bees are currently in second position in their league, just a point off the top of the table with 10 games to play this season."We have raw, raw talent here and have basically started a team from scratch, but as you can see we have made great strides in a very short space of time," club chairman Nceba Ntlantsana told the&nbsp;PSL&nbsp;website."For our players, from such a rural background, the thought of possibly playing a Kaizer Chiefs or Orlando Pirates is incredible, beyond their wildest dreams. But that is the opportunity that the Nedbank Cup gives you," he added.Pirates, meanwhile, are the second most successful team in the competition&rsquo;s history with eight titles and lost last season's final to SuperSport United.Since taking charge of the Buccaneers' fortunes, head coach Kjell Jonevret has seen his side play to three 1-1 draws.There were certainly positives to take from the last two matches as Bucs came from behind to earn a point against both Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United, and Jonevret will now be keen to use the Nedbank Cup as a chance to get a first win under his belt in South Africa.The Swede though has been in the game long enough though to appreciate the pitfalls of playing lower league opposition and accepts his charges will be in for a battle."I know how it is with these games that everybody expects you to win. I hate them because they (Bees) will fight like never before since they have nothing to lose and everything to gain," he said."It's going to be tough. We are going there with our best possible line-up, even though I will rest a few guys because we have played two tough games against Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United. This cup is our chance to get something out of this season," Jonevret was quoted saying by the&nbsp;Star.Neither team has any suspensions. Thabo Qalinge (back) and Thabo Rakhale (hamstring) remain sidelined, but according to the Pirates website, recent short-term injury concerns Ntsikelelo Nyauza and Riyaad Norodien both have a good chance of regaining fitness ahead of the weekend's showdown in Mndantsane near East London.
