Dear MizzB&nbsp; How can I, as a parent, teach my children to protect themselves against sexual abuse? -&thinsp;Worried Parent&nbsp;Dear Worried Parent Teach your children from an early age about their bodies so they know the difference between wrong and right touching. Tell me it&rsquo;s okay to say no if they are uncomfortable with being touched by anyone and it is important to expose secrets.&nbsp; Make time for your children by talking about their daily activities so that you can pick up any awkward routines, people and habits.&nbsp; Be active in your children&rsquo;s life by participating and talking about what sexual assault, harassment and violation is.&nbsp;
