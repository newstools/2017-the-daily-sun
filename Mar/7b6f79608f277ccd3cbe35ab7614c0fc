MAMELODI Sundowns head coach Pitso Mosimane has admitted that his side are going to Saturday's (8:15pm) clash against Kaizer Chiefs in an Absa Premiership match at FNB Stadium as underdogs. Mosimane is also concerned because Downs have been crippled by injuries to key players ahead of their crucial game. Sundowns will go into this match having grabbed two points from possible nine points in the league. They have dropped points against Cape Town City (1-0), Chippa United (0-0) and Polokwane City (0-0). And Mosimane says this could come as a disadvantage for them on Saturday night. The PSL defending Champions are playing catch up in the league. They have 34 points from 17 games while Chiefs have 36 points from 21 games. Mosimane said: "looking at how we have been performing and how Chiefs has also been doing. I must admit that we envy Chiefs, we wish we could also win 5 games in a row. "We come into this Match as underdogs. We have been dropping points while they have been collecting points where it mattered. However, Amakhosi coach Steve Komphela reckons the Caf Champions League winners are no underdogs and his side should give them all the respect they deserve. Komphela responded: "Underdogs? I beg to differ, they are not underdogs, maybe they are seeking divine intervention." Komphela hasn't beaten Sundowns since he took the reins from Coach Stuart Baxter, who is now with SuperSport United. Added Komphela: &ldquo;Sundowns have been doing well. One or two matches cannot define the African Champions. &ldquo;I am going to represent Chiefs on Saturday and we have objectivity. I'm not going there with a grudge that I lost two games against them.&rdquo;
