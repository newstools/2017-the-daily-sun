&lsquo;ALL South Africans must wake up and smell the coffee.&rdquo;This was just one of several dramatic statements made in a press conference held by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and former deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas today.After months of swirling rumours, the two were axed last night in a major Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma.Both Gordhan and Jonas looked composed as they addressed a wide range of issues.Gordhan emphasized that his sole agenda as finance minister was to take decisions that benefitted South Africa as a whole, and not &ldquo;narrow interests&rdquo;.He said that allegations that he had &ldquo;secret meetings with the intention of undermining this government&rdquo; were &ldquo;sickening&rdquo;, emphasizing that he was an anti-apartheid activist from a young age and had fought hard for the democratic freedoms of Mzansi.These allegations were contained in an apparent &ldquo;intelligence report&rdquo; called Operation Check Mate, circulated earlier this week.Gordhan also issued a call to action for all South Africans to organise and mobilise to make sure that authorities act in the country&rsquo;s interests, not in their own narrow interests.&ldquo;South Africans must make it clear our country is not for sale,&rdquo; he said.He also made a humouress reference to &ldquo;brown bags&rdquo; used to carry bribes for &ldquo;captured&rdquo; officials, saying: &ldquo;Our souls are not for sale. We also have our brown bags and we use them for carrying clothes.&rdquo;At one point, Gordhan invited the media to commend Jonas for allegedly turning down a R600 million bribe from the Guptas to become finance minister. These allegations are among several regarding the Guptas efforts to unlawfully and corruptly influence State decisions in the Public Protector&rsquo;s State of Capture report released in 2016.The report is currently been taken on review by Zuma.The media present responded with thundering applause.Jonas was equally hard hitting in his comments. &ldquo;All South Africans must wake up and smell the coffee. There are a lot of cases in history where country&rsquo;s make a swift turn and never recover ... We are at a crossroads as South Africans and we must not take it lightly.&ldquo;Look at events over the last years and you&rsquo;ll see several patterns pointing to protecting interests.&rdquo;&nbsp;The State of Capture report paints the full picture of these patterns, said Jonas, which all point to state institutions being made increasingly vulnerable to &ldquo;attack and looting&rdquo;.&ldquo;You have in front of you history unfolding, and in the centre is our democracy and economy being undermined by all kinds of things,&rdquo; said Jonas. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll one day be accused of living with our eyes wide shut&rdquo; while the political rot deepens, he warned.Both Jonas and Gordhan repeatedly told journalists to &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo;, indicating that all the evidence of this political rot was already out there and they must figure out the bigger picture.Gordhan concluded by saying there was no tension in his relationship with Zuma. He said he first met Zuma in 1974 when Zuma came off Robben Island, and was one of the young activists who helped him at the time, including getting him out of the country in 1976.The incoming &nbsp;finance minister is Malusi Gigaba, who had been minister of home affairs.
