DESPITE knowing that Maritzburg United will throw everything at them, Golden Arrows goalkeeper, Nkosingiphile Gumede, says all he wants is to keep a clean sheet when these two square up again.This afternoon, Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende welcome their arch-rivals, United, in the Nedbank Cup Last 32.The game is at Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban, KZN, (3pm).Having already played the Team of Choice and beaten them eight days ago in the Absa Premiership at the same stadium, Gumede said they still posed a big threat and it wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to beat them twice in a row.&ldquo;Maritzburg have quality players with experience. It&rsquo;s never easy to play them. It&rsquo;s a derby and it&rsquo;s always hard to play in a derby. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s even tougher now that we are going to play it in a short space of time,&rdquo; said Gumede.The goalie from Chesterville, in Durban, added that despite the quality of players they have and the threat they pose, Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende have the advantage. Gumede added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re playing at home and this season we&rsquo;ve made it clear that we need to hold our own at home.&ldquo;Princess Magogo has been a good hunting ground for us and we&rsquo;re looking to continue with that form. &ldquo;As for me, all I want is to keep a clean sheet in this match. I did it last week and want to do it again.&rdquo;The 23-year-old is a product of Arrows development and has all the good qualities to succeed in this position. He has made the number one jersey his after Namibian Maximilian Mbaeva&rsquo;s injury late last year.He said: &ldquo;The club have four keepers and all of them are good. So, it&rsquo;s important to make sure one takes the chances presented with both hands. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; The young shot stopper also said they&rsquo;re taking it one game at a time since they are prepared to go a long way in this tournament.
