HE is only 23 years old, but he might spend the next 20 years of his life behind bars. Bonga Skolpati avoided life imprisonment when the Mthatha High Court sentenced him to 20 years in prison on Friday. Judge Mpumelelo Notununu said he could not ignore Skolpati&rsquo;s age and the fact that he was a first-time offender. Skolpati and Noluthando Baleni were arrested last February for shooting Noluthando&rsquo;s husband, Kholisile Baleni, in 2015. Noluthando promised to pay Skolpati if he killed her husband, but he was arrested before he received any payment. The 20-year murder sentence will run at the same time as a three-year sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm and a year-long sentence for possession of ammunition. Skolpati was found guilty after his girlfriend, Yolanda Ntshuntshe, testified against him. Skolpati was intially charged with Noluthando and her father Mandlenkosi Mgutyana, who was acquitted earlier this month. Judge Notununu said Skolpati showed no remorse. &ldquo;You could have had a change of heart on the journey from East London to Mthatha, but you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said to Skolpati. Skolpati&rsquo;s lawyer Sihle Mzileni said the age of his client, the fact that he was a school drop-out, a first time offender and the father of a toddler, must be considered during sentencing. Notununu said Skolpati is young and still has a chance to be rehabilitated.
