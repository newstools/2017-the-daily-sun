EDUCATION activist Hendrick Makaneta says pregnant pupils should be treated better at schools. Hendrick said government should build sickrooms for pregnant and sick pupils in all schools. The call comes after it was reported that a school in Mpumalanga ordered pupils and parents to sign forms declaring that pupils will not fall pregnant in the year. &ldquo;Principals who make pupils sign forms declaring that they will not get pregnant during their studies are violating the rights of those pupils,&rdquo; he said. Hendrick told Daily Sun teachers must uphold their duty of care at all times to safeguard pupils from harm. &ldquo;In the absence of parents, teachers take on the role of parents.&rdquo;He said if a girl does not feel well during a lesson, she must be given a chance to go and rest in the sickroom.Hendrick said pregnant pupils are important human beings whose rights to education must be respected and prioritised. He said Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga should open a free direct line to her office where pregnant girls can phone if experiencing problems at school.
