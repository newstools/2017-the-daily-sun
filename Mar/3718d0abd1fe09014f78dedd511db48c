A HEARTLESS monster went on the rampage, raping women before killing them and burning their faces. But he developed a conscience after the last attack on Tuesday and handed himself in to police in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni. He told cops to arrest him and took them to the scene of his last crime. Cops found one of the victims with her hands tied and her face burnt beyond recognition. The woman was half-naked and her burned handbag had been put on her face.The woman could only be identified by her red and white striped blouse and a pair of black socks she was wearing. According to cops, the suspect (26) had three different shacks in Brakpan. He allegedly lured his victims by going to nearby townships and saying he wanted to recruit women who were interested in being domestic workers. He then arranged to meet them in the Brakpan CBD before promising to take them to where he worked. But instead he would take them to the veld, where he raped and murdered them. Cops said two more bodies were found in the bushes and the suspect had been linked to them. Speaking about the woman killed on Tuesday, Captain Pearl van Staadt said: &ldquo;According to a relative, she got scared and sent a WhatsApp messages to her family when she saw the suspect taking her in the wrong direction. &ldquo;That was the last time anyone heard from her.&rdquo; The suspect gave a number of different addresses when he was asked where he lived. He will appear in court soon on charges of rape and murder.
