THREE pupils are lucky to be alive after being knocked down and dragged by a Quantum on Monday morning. It happened next to Dr Belcher Road in Mangaung. Witness Michael Kaota (36) from Joe Slovo said: &ldquo;I was listening to music next to my shack when I saw the speeding Quantum leave the tar road for the pedestrian road. &ldquo;I was worried about the three kids walking next to the road. The vehicle came straight at them and knocked them over. I jumped to help. &ldquo;I thought I was dreaming. The car dragged them into the veld, where I heard them screaming. &ldquo;When the driver managed to stop, one kid was still under the wheel. We had to lift up the vehicle to get her out. &ldquo;The driver tried to run away but I held on to him until the police came,&rdquo; Michael said. The driver was allegedly drunk and residents said they found booze inside the vehicle, including chibuku. &ldquo;We wanted to beat him as we were angry that a driver who is drunk on a Monday should be rescued by police. In the car, we found beers. He was so drunk he couldn&rsquo;t even stand or speak.&ldquo;The only way to keep us safe on this busy road is to put in speed bumps, as there is an accident there every day,&rdquo; said Michael.Health communication officer Palesa Matee said three kids were admitted to Pelonomi Hospital on Monday, including Tlotliso Mohlakoana (10), who is in a critical condition, as well as Lerato Mohlakoana (8) and Relebohile Faku (7), who are both stable. Police spokesman Sergeant Thabo Litabe confirmed the incident, saying that a case of reckless and negligent drunk driving has been opened. A 45-year-old suspect was arrested and will appear in court soon.
