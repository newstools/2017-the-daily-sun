A CLOUD of doubt hangs over the head of interim Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis. Ellis, who is filling in because Vera Pauw&rsquo;s contract was not renewed after the Olympics last August, will have to wait a while longer before finding out if she is getting a permanent appointment. The odds are seemingly stacked against Ellis getting the job, however, as she was nowhere to be seen during the recent two-day JM Busha Women&rsquo;s Football Tournament in Alexandra. National selectors Anna Monate, Simphiwe Dludlu and Banyana video analyst Sherlyn Booysen were all present. SA Football Association (Safa) technical director of women&rsquo;s football, Fran Hilton-Smith, was cagey about details of the coaching job yesterday.She reiterated Safa president Danny Jordaan&rsquo;s statement that the focus would shift to appointing a Banyana coach once the Bafana Bafana position has been filled.Said Hilton-Smith: &ldquo;Like the president said, they are busy with Bafana at the moment. As soon as they are done, the focus will shift to Banyana.&rdquo;She added that a national executive committee workshop would be held on the weekend to discuss the criteria to use for appointing a new head coach. She would not reveal if they are looking for a local or international coach. &ldquo;There are discussions on that. I can&rsquo;t share that, it will be discussed in Durban this weekend,&rdquo; she said. With a quiet year ahead on the women&rsquo;s football calender, Banyana will not be active during the current Fifa International break, although there is a match planned for the senior women&rsquo;s team in April. Playing more frequently would help Banyana improve ahead of a busy 2018, featuring the Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations and Fifa 2019 World Cup qualifiers.&ldquo;Banyana will be active in April. We are finalising the details of our opponents and the dates,&rdquo; she added.
