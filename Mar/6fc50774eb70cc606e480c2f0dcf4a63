Former Kaizer Chiefs dribbling wizard Jabu Mahlangu has expressed his disappointment in the lack of progress made by midfielder George Lebese in the Premiership this season.&nbsp;The 26-year-old winger has increasingly fallen out of favour with the Soweto giants and has subsequently lost his starting berth in Steve Komphela's side, with his last start coming in the 1-1 draw against Cape Town City.&nbsp;The fan-favourite has registered 17 appearances in all competitions thus far netting three goals in the process, which is a stark contrast of his form last season which saw him form an integral part of the Chiefs side - ending the season with a career-best of eight goals."I am disappointed with the way Lebese has done this season," Mahlangu told&nbsp;Isolezwe."He should be the engine of Amakhosi right now but he can&rsquo;t find or keep his rhythm.&nbsp;"Today he plays well, then the next match he is nowhere. I thought he would change."Time is running out for him and he will be slowing down soon (because of age).&nbsp;"I hope he can see his problem as well and will fix it soon because as it is now, he is no longer a dangerous player anymore. Whether he is there or not makes no difference in the team," he concluded.
