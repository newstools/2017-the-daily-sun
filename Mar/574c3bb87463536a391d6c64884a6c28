ALEX residents love soccer so much, they decided to name their streets after the beautiful game!And the streets in Alexandra&rsquo;s extension 7 all have names that have something to do with soccer. These range from Game to Soccer, Penalty, Goalkeeper and even Halftime streets.The names bring joy to the residents of the township, who see the move as a great one.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t miss football. &ldquo;I just go around my neighbourhood and come home as if I have watched a full game,&rdquo; said soccer fan Tebogo Thela.Sipho Khohlakala (38), who lives in Midfielder Street, said the names make them feel like they are watching soccer every day. &ldquo;If a visitor is lost in Penalty Street, I tell them they are about to score if they just jump one street and meet me at Goal Street,&rdquo; he laughed.But not everyone is sold on the names. Some believe the streets should have been named after local heroes.Football legend Maimane Phiri said: &ldquo;If they were obsessed with soccer, why could they not use the names of legends from the township? We had people from Alexandra who put the kasi on the football map, such as Shakes Hlongwane, John &lsquo;Shoes&rsquo; Moshoeu, Daniel &lsquo;Vader&rsquo; Mophosho as well as many others.&rdquo; Linda Twala agreed with him. &ldquo;There are people in Alex who have worked hard on building the community, like retired teachers, soldiers as well as community builders,&rdquo; he said.Joburg Roads Agency Spokeswoman Bertha Peter-Scheepers said the agency does not name the streets. &ldquo;The Heritage Council is responsible for making consultations with a particular community. The agency just puts up the signs.&rdquo;
