FAN FAVOURITE Percy Tau says defeat is not in their vocabulary ahead of Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; visit to Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium tomorrow (8.15pm).&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important we keep to the goals we set,&rdquo; said the 22-year-old eMalahleni-born midfielder who scored Bafana Bafana&rsquo;s cracker against Guinea-Bissau last week.Tau was also rewarded by the PSL on Wednesday when another one of his goals, scored against Free State Stars in December, was voted Goal of the Month.He reckons Masandawana fans are still happy, despite the fact that they have not been consistent in the Absa Premiership lately.Matches in hand have certainly not guaranteed Sundowns points in the bag. They last won a match in February when they played Bidvest Wits. They have registered two draws and one loss to log leaders Cape Town City since then. Chiefs could be the trampoline Downs use to bounce back and return to winning ways.Said Tau: &ldquo;We will do our best, we will give our everything. If we do our best we should be able to get a draw, if not a win. It is always better to get a draw than to lose. &ldquo;And we just won a match to qualify for the group stages of the Champions League, which will have made our fans happy.&rdquo;The ex-Witbank Spurs player said he was ready to face Amakhosi and hopefully contribute with his boot. He said the FNB Stadium held special 2010 Fifa World Cup memories for him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a good game. We have learnt from our previous mistakes.&rdquo;Amakhosi midfielder George Lebese, who has not been a regular for coach Steve Komphela, said they used the Fifa break to prepare for this crunch match against Downs. Lebese, whose goal against Ajax Cape Town in October last year won Goal of the Month, said: &ldquo;We have been watching videos of Sundowns.&rdquo;He added that had one of their recent draws been a win their log standing would have been better.
