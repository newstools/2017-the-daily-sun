MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia has appointed Fadlu Davids as the club&rsquo;s caretaker coach until the end of the season. Kadodia was left shocked when his head coach, Roger de Sa, resigned on Wednesday. Said Kadodia: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow anyone to come in now, with just nine matches to go before the season ends. I&rsquo;ve appointed Fadlu and he was happy to step in.&rdquo;The United boss also revealed his disappointment about the sudden resignation of former Bidvest Wits, Orlando Pirates and Ajax Cape Town mentor De Sa. &ldquo;His reason for leaving was because his family in Cape Town is not coping without him. &ldquo;I was shocked to hear that because I thought the matter was sorted out before he joined us in January. &ldquo;When I approached him to come and work for my team in December, he said he needed time to be with his family. &ldquo;So I really thought everything was sorted out. But that&rsquo;s water under the bridge now. We need to move on,&rdquo; said Kadodia. The 52-year-old De Sa joined United in January, taking over from Davids who was caretaker coach after the resignation of Ernst Middendorp last November. In his brief stay at Maritzburg, De Sa was on the bench for seven matches &ndash; six Absa Premiership games and one Nedbank Cup clash. His charges only won one match, drew one and lost the rest. The team collect four of 18 points on offer in the six league matches. They were also early round losers in the Nedbank Cup. Davids, however, had a good run with the Team of Choice after Middendorp&rsquo;s departure. He was in charge for five matches and did not lose any of them. .
