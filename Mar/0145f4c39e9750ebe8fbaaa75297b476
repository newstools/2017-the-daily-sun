DURBAN has lost the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. There had been doubt over the KwaZulu-Natal city&rsquo;s hosting of the Games after event organisers had missed various submission deadlines with the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). Sport Minister Fikile Mbalula had said towards the end of last month that Durban risked losing out on hosting the showpiece due to cost challenges. According to sources Gideon Sam, president of the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, confirmed this development yesterday. Sam said: &ldquo;The CGF is looking for an alternative to Durban.&rdquo; Durban was the only city to launch a formal bid to host the Games after Edmonton in Canada withdrew. No replacement has been named, although Liverpool was eager to offer its services. The 2018 Commonwealth Games will be held in the Gold Coast, Australia.&nbsp; &ndash; SPORT24
