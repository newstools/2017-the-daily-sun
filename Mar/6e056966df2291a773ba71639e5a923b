SEEING somebody winning R1 million at a casino almost ruined Masego&rsquo;s life.In 1998 she was staying in Dalpark, Brakpan near Boksburg, Ekurhuleni when she had her first taste of gambling at Carnival City. &ldquo;When I saw somebody winning all that money I took my salary to the casino and tried my luck,&rdquo; said Masego Kwenamore, who is now 41 and lives in Klerksdorp, North West. She said she wasn&rsquo;t lucky but she didn&rsquo;t stop. For nearly 15 years she struggled with her painful and self-destructive behaviour. &ldquo;On the surface I was living a happy and fulfilled life.&rdquo; In 2007 she left her three-week-old baby with her 11-year- old daughter. She went to the casino and left them alone from 3pm until 3am. &ldquo;In 2013 my life went from bad to worse. &ldquo;I sold my furniture and my husband&rsquo;s old car. I even sold my work laptop.&rdquo; She also stole her husband&rsquo;s money, thinking she would win it back. Then she tried to commit suicide by taking rat poison mixed with pap and spinach. &ldquo;My daughter called the paramedics who took me to hospital. I was disappointed that I didn&rsquo;t die because I had lost everything. My life had become meaningless.&rdquo; She said in all her years of gambling, her biggest win was R12 000. Things took a turn for the better when she started going to church. &ldquo;I prayed to God to take the problem away.&rdquo; Now she motivates people on various radio stations about the dangers of gambling.
