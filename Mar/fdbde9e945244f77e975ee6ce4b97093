NJABULO Nyandeni had hoped to study towards a diploma in mechanical engineering. But the 18-year-old now says Home Affairs wants to crush his dreams. Njabulo says he&rsquo;s frustrated because Home Affairs in Mogale City, Gauteng says his surname is Buthelezi when it is actually Nyandeni.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told the boy is not mine,&rdquo; said his mother, Fikile Nyandeni, from Kagiso extension 13.The problem started in 2003, when Fikile applied for a birth certificate at Vryheid Home Affairs in KZN for her son.Fikile showed Daily Sun a document stamped by Ceza Hospital. The document proves that she&rsquo;s his biological mother and his surname was Nyandeni.Njabulo said: &ldquo;I went to Home Affairs with my mother and my baby who is now a Buthelezi. &ldquo;I explained the situation to them but nothing has changed.&rdquo; He said all he wants is a chance to study so he can find a job. &ldquo;I want to be able to take care of my mum. I want to be able to buy her a house and a car.&rdquo; Thabo Mokgola, Gauteng Home Affairs spokesman, said the provincial manager will investigate the circumstances of the mix-up. &ldquo;We will contact Njabulo to try and resolve the matter.&rdquo;
