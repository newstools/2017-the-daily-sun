BAFANA BAFANA and former Mamelodi Sundowns player Bongani Zungu&rsquo;s love life has allegedly taken a new direction.After he broke up with his girlfriend Khanyi Cele last year, the two are said to be back in each other&rsquo;s arms again.&nbsp;And this time, he has allegedly shown maturity and decided to take the relationship to the next level.&nbsp;Sunday Sun sources close to the couple allege that Bongani has already assembled a family delegation to go to Khanyi&rsquo;s family for ilobolo negotiations.&nbsp;One of their friends told Sunday Sun the two were so in love and serious about life together.&nbsp;The friend said Khanyi was forever flying in and out of Portugal to be with Bongani.&nbsp;&ldquo;Khanyi is often in Portugal with Bongani, she moved in with him late last year. She&rsquo;s ready to be his wife. You can see the way she&rsquo;s carrying herself.&nbsp;&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a level of maturity in Bongani&rsquo;s behaviour also, which I can say is the reason for his plans to pay ilobolo for Khanyi,&rdquo; said the friend.&nbsp;Another source said: &ldquo;Bongani&rsquo;s move to Portugal is the reason why Khanyi decided to work things out with him &ndash; because she knew he would be homesick most of the time, as he was alone.&nbsp;&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re happy for them and hope they&rsquo;ll end their endless series of bust-ups and reconciliations.&rdquo;&nbsp;Last year, the SunTeam reported that Bongani was working toward paying ilobolo for Khanyi, but didn&rsquo;t stop cheating. And that allegedly led to one of the several break-ups staged by the passionate couple.&nbsp;Sunday Sun has reported about their roller-coaster relationship on several occasions.&nbsp;Bongani and Khanyi were not available for comment.&nbsp;
