WHEN he was a young boy, Hendrick Chadanga dreamt of one day becoming a cop. But every time he applied to join the force, he was rejected. This didn&rsquo;t stop Hendrick from admiring South Africa&rsquo;s crime fighters, and now he supports the lawmen in his art. The 29-year-old has become the talk of the town in Dilopye Village, Hammanskraal after building a replica police helicopter! &ldquo;As a young boy, I always wanted to be a police officer but every time I applied I was unsuccessful. Then I had a bright idea. I decided to build a helicopter,&rdquo; said Hendrick He said it took him seven months to build the chopper, using scrap metal to put it together. Hendrick&rsquo;s helicopter draws a crowd every day. &ldquo;Everybody asks me how I did it. They take pictures of it. Even cops come and visit me,&rdquo; said Hendrick. Despite facing several challenges, Hendrick believes his chopper will one day open doors of opportunity. &ldquo;I built this helicopter because I want it to fly. But I still need an engine and a few other parts to get it going.&rdquo; Hendrick&rsquo;s chopper does have something police helicopters don&rsquo;t &ndash; a sound system!
