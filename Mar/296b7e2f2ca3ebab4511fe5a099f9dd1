MORE than 28 000 athletes are expected to line up in the streets of Cape Town on Easter weekend as they compete for top honours in the 48th edition of the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon. The starter&rsquo;s gun will go off at 6.40am to signal the start of the race outside SA Breweries in Main Road, Newlands. The finish line is at the University of Cape Town. The 56km ultra marathon will follow the famous route through Fish Hoek, Chapman&rsquo;s Peak Drive, Hout Bay, Constantia Nek, Rhodes Drive and Union Avenue.Athletes will be eager to push their bodies hard this year as race sponsor Old Mutual, for the fourth year running, is offering R1 million each to the man and woman capable of winning the race in a new record time. It remains unclear whether last year&rsquo;s winner, Mike Fokoroni from Zimbabwe, and his compatriot Collen Makaza will compete and try their luck for the R1m bonus.But SunSport understands that Motlokoa Nkhabutlane and Mabhutile Lebopo from Lesotho, Charles Tjiane and Ludwick Mamabolo will compete this year.Caroline Wostman will lead the women&rsquo;s category along with Charne Bosman. This special R1m incentive is over and above the regular prize money awarded to the winners annually.In the men&rsquo;s category, runners will have to breast the tape in a mere three hours to beat the men&rsquo;s record of 3:03:44, set by Thompson Magawana in 1988. Frith van der Merwe set the women&rsquo;s record of 3:30:36 a year later.Race organisers also revealed yesterday that the popular Easter weekend marathon put approximately R672m into the coffers of the City of Cape Town and the Western Cape last year.&ldquo;This significant economic injection into the city and region makes the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon the largest running event on the African continent,&rdquo; a statement said yesterday.Carol Vosloo, general manager of the Two Oceans, said the race was not just a celebration of running but also a celebration of Cape Town and all that the Mother City has to offer.&ldquo;Two-thirds of the ultra marathon field come from outside the Western Cape and we attract an increasing number of international runners to the race year on year,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;These runners arrive with friends and family, and the city enjoys an estimated influx of approximately 100 000 visitors over race week.&rdquo;A calculated 11 000 athletes have registered for the 56km ultra marathon this year, with 16 000 more expected in the 21,1km half marathon along with 1 000 trail runners, coming from 86 countries across the world.The organisers will fork out R1,8m in total prize money paid out to the top men and women in the ultra and half marathons.
