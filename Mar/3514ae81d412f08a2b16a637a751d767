FAVOURITE Carlos Queiroz is now out of the race for the Bafana Bafana head coach job.Queiroz has outstanding issues with the Iran Football Association, which makes it very difficult for him to clinch a deal with Safa. The much sought-after Bafana job has now become a two-horse race between Herve Renard and Hugo Broos.Well-placed Safa insiders have revealed the association is working on the affordability of the two and the offers will be put on the table in the coming week. It has also come to the fore that the technical committee is in favour of Renard, who has become the go-to-guy for winning Afcon tournaments.In 2012, Renard guided Zambia to win their first-ever Afcon. Three years later, he was at the helm when Ivory Coast ended their 23-year Afcon drought, when they won the tournament in Equatorial Guinea. It was reported that Renard was available after rumours surfaced that he recently resigned from his post as Morocco head coach. But reports from Morocco are that assistant coach Mustafi Hadji has been quoted as saying Renard is going nowhere and remains contracted to the Moroccan team until the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia. Renard has also coached the Angola national team and French clubs FC Sochaux and Lille. The 64 year-old Broos was regarded as a hero when he clinched this years&rsquo; edition of the Afcon with Cameroon, having used an under-strength side after the country&rsquo;s big names snubbed the tournament. Queiroz, who coached SA during 2002 Afcon in Mali, was tipped to take over from Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba, who was booted from the job after a case of misconduct. The association will be approaching Broos and Renard this week, and an official announcement should be expected by the end of the week.
