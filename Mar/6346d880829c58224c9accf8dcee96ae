BAFANA Bafana star Keagan Dolly says his playing career in France should serve as proof to other young South Africans that dreams do come true. The 24-year-old is enjoying his time at former French champions Montpellier HSC. The left-footed player has already played seven matches for the Ligue 1 outfit. He said playing overseas was a childhood dream and he is over the moon that this dream has come true. &ldquo;With hard work and determination dreams can come true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My move overseas should prove to other young players that it can be done. I really would like to see more young players going out and playing in Europe.&rdquo; The dribbling wizard said playing in the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil and the Fifa Club World Cup with Mamelodi Sundowns in Japan in December last year really helped him adapt quicker in France. He said: &ldquo;Playing in Europe doesn&rsquo;t only benefit you as a player but the national team as well. That experience you gain there is vital. The Olympics and Club World Cup really prepared me well for what lay ahead.&rdquo;Dolly was named Man of the Match on Saturday when Bafana beat Guinea-Bissau 3-1 in their international friendly at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. His pass was the one that found former Sundowns teammate Percy Tau, who scored on debut.The other scorers for Bafana were Kermit Erasmus and Andile Jali. Both scored from a penalty. Dolly said playing alongside the likes of Erasmus, Kamohelo Mokotjo and Thulani Serero had really boosted his confidence.&ldquo;When I joined the camp I was welcomed and made to feel at home. I look up to these guys and I always told myself I wanted to be like them some day &ndash; playing in Europe and excelling like them. &ldquo;It was really easy to play with them &ndash; we had an understanding,&rdquo; added Dolly.
