The teachers are running away from the truth because they owe us the financial report from last year.” Speaking on behalf of the more than 200 pupils, Sisipho Nkonzombi said: “All we want is to study. It doesn’t matter if new teachers are appointed or our teachers return.” Pupils are due to write their first quarterly tests today, and residents and teachers from other schools plan to help them over weekends. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said he was going to investigate.Libode district manager Thandeka Vikilahle said: “We will go to the community to find solutions but won’t force teachers to go back.”
