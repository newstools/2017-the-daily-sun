THERE was no change at the bottom of the Absa Premiership table after yesterday&rsquo;s action involving three sides in the relegation zone, despite Highlands Park registering a last gasp 1-0 win over Free State Stars at Goble Park. Second from bottom Highlands eased their relegation fears thanks to a late strike from Molhobi Mvala. But the Lions of the North remain second from bottom on 17 points, one behind both Bloemfontein Celtic and FS Stars. Bottom club Baroka FC are still propping up the table with 14 points after a dull Polokwane derby against Polokwane City that ended 0-0 at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium. City keeper George Chigova&rsquo;s brilliant save of a Helder Pelembe header &ndash; the last shot of the game &ndash; denied Baroka the three points. But for Baroka, who had shipped in eight goals in their previous two matches, this was an improvement. Still, they have a lot of work to do if they are to avoid going straight back to the National First Division after one season in the top flight. The big talking point was a controversial decision from a linesman, who adjudged City&rsquo;s Rodney Ramagalela offside in the 32nd minute when the striker looked onside. He then appeared to be brought down by keeper Oscarine Masuluke inside the danger area, but referee Naasif Julius backed his assistant on the near side and blew for offside. And then Julius turned down a penalty appeal for Rise and Shine when Olaleng Shaku brought down Sammy Seabi inside the penalty area a minute from the break.
