A LACK of sanitary pads is still a sensitive issue for many pupils.Melisizwe Primary School pupils had mixed reactions when sanitary pads were donated to the school on Wednesday.Some looked embarrassed while others looked delighted. However, they all appreciated the donation. About 146 pads were donated to grade 6 and 7 pupils from the school. The pads were donated by Pastor Ronnie Johnson from Port Elizabeth-based radio station PE FM.He said: &ldquo;We launched this initiative last month and we have identified three needy primary schools. &ldquo;We do not want young girls to bunk school because they do not have sanitary pads. &ldquo;We want to restore their dignity and encourage them to understand their bodies. &ldquo;Through this project we donated 140 sanitary pads to pupils from Missionvale Primary School. &ldquo;On Thursday we will make a donation to Verite Primary School in Uitenhage.&rdquo;Vuyiseka Kula, a teacher, said: &ldquo;Pupils would sometimes ask us for help, but we do not have any sanitary pads.&ldquo;Some pupils would fall behind in their school work because they would skip school when they had their period. &ldquo;Others made their own pads with unclean material.&ldquo;This donation is a great relief for us.&rdquo;
