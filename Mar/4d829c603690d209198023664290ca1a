PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma's recalling Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan from an overseas trip has nothing to do with the African National Congress, secretary general Gwede Mantashe said today.The ANC knew nothing about the decision as it was a government matter, he told reporters at a briefing about the ANC's national executive committee meeting.Earlier, the Presidency said both Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas had been instructed to return from an investor roadshow trip to London, Boston and New York. No reason was given.The move fuelled speculation that Zuma was preparing to reshuffle his Cabinet.Mantashe said they had yet to have their weekly meeting with the ANC's top six officials to get a briefing from Zuma.Mantashe said the party would not fuel speculation about a reshuffle or that claims that Gordhan was summoned back over a court case involving the Gupta family. The case is due to start tomorrow. Gordhan is seeking a declaratory order to protect the Treasury's executive from having to intervene in the decision by the country's top four bans to close the Gupta family's bank accounts.Zuma appointed Gordhan after he made the disastrous decision to replace Nhlanhla Nene with Des van Rooyen in December 2015.The rand weakened against the US dollar in reaction to today&rsquo;s news. It fell 40c and later recovered to R12.60."The real impact will be seen when there are any other steps," Mantashe said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/not-our-business-says-anc-of-gordhans-recall-20170327
