PSL CHAIRMAN Irvin Khoza is expected in the Netherlands today where he will join reigning Diski Challenge champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, as a guest at the inaugural MultiChoice International Challenge tomorrow.The International Challenge will feature four sides &ndash; Sundowns, SBV Excelsior (Netherlands) AKA Gent (Belgium) and Ichifuna FC (China). SunSport has been informed by reliable sources that Khoza might use the opportunity to renew the PSL&rsquo;s relationship with MultiChoice for the Diski Challenge, as their three-year barter agreement expires this year.The MDC, which poses as the PSL&rsquo;s reserve league, was a great success and it would be beneficial for the league to formalise terms with MultiChoice and extend their relationship. The Orlando Pirates chairman is billed to also visit the Royal Netherlands Football Association, the KNVB. The MDC was launched in the 2014-15 season comprising 16 reserve teams from the PSL with the aim of fast-tracking the development of Under-23 players into first teams.The inaugural competition was won by University of Pretoria before Golden Arrows claimed the baton last year.AmaTuks and Arrows played three friendly matches per team in the Netherlands in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons respectively. Over the past two years exciting players have been discovered in the MDC, such as Menzi Masuku, who is one of the players who came up from the reserve league to join Bucs&rsquo; top ranks. Sporting Lisbon striker Liam Jordan, Denwin Farmer (SuperSport United), Modjeka Madisha, (Sundowns) and Kobamelo Kodisang (Platinum Stars) are some of the players who first made a name for themselves in the MDC.Meanwhile, SuperSport will launch a Rugby Challenge similar to the MDC, which will kick off next month.This will be part of a major makeover for the opening provincial competition of the South African rugby season.The SuperSport Rugby Challenge will kick off on the weekend of 22-23 April and will feature the country&rsquo;s 14 provincial unions together with Namibia&rsquo;s Welwitschias in a refreshing 13-week tournament.Professional rugby will also make a starring appearance at well-known community rugby centres for televised rugby festivals. Venues such as the Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth, Bill Jardine Stadium in Joburg and the venue of last year&rsquo;s club rugby Gold Cup final, Impala Rugby Club in Rustenburg, will host Challenge matches.
