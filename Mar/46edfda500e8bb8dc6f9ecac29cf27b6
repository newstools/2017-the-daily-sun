ONE mama has taken it upon herself to continue making money.This is after the hawkers were evicted by the King Sabata Dalindyebo Muncipality almost three weeks ago.They gather outside the municipal office daily to put pressure on officials to allow them to trade again.Meanwhile, Fikiswa Tyekela wakes up at 4am to prepare food for the day. She hands the food over to her employees, who sell it at a temporary spot near the court building in Mthatha. Fikiswa then joins her fellow protesters at the office.She has seven employees working at various tables.The mother of two says she cannot just fold her arms while her kids, including a university student, need money for food and accommodation.Her takeaways are bought by court staff and workers at the very municipality that kicked her out.She said on a good day she makes over R5 000.&ldquo;Our hope is for the municipality to allocate us a place that will meet their standards,&rdquo; she said.The municipality stands by its decision to remove hawkers from the busy town, which led to the protest.As part of his plans as new mayor, Dumani Zozo aims to make Mthatha a clean place that attracts legitimate businesses and tourism.Municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said the rural town of Mqanduli, which falls under the municipality, served its hawkers with eviction notices as part of the clean-up plan for the region.
