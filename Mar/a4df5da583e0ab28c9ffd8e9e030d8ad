MUM Tshokolo Sejane was left searching for answers when she dreamt about coffins lining up in her bedroom.&nbsp; But sadly the answer to her scary visions would soon be revealed&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp; This was after her 10-year-old son fell into an uncovered manhole the next day &ndash;&ensp;and drowned!&nbsp; Heartbroken Tshokolo (34) told Daily Sun she never thought the weird dream meant she would lose her son.&nbsp; Kananelo Salemane (10) was playing with other kids near a bridge in Clocolan, Free State on Saturday when the incident happened.&nbsp; Tshokolo said: &ldquo;Kananelo was in grade&thinsp;4. He was a very bright child. He told me he wanted to become a doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I dreamed of coffins in my house the day before. My sister called me and said she too had dreamt of coffins and that her grandson had been crying the whole night, but we didn&rsquo;t know what it meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was shocked when police arrived and escorted me to the open manhole, where I saw my son&rsquo;s body floating in the water.&nbsp; &ldquo;Divers removed his body at about 7pm. I blame the municipality for this. If the manhole had been covered, my son would still be alive today.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shocked residents said the municipality should act quickly before the manhole swallowed another child.&nbsp; Police spokesman Phumelelo Dhlamini said an inquest docket had been opened.&nbsp; Councillor Tshidiso Jakobo conveyed his condolences to the family.&nbsp; He said the old pump station manhole was without a fence for a long time but was then fenced. &ldquo;Unfortunately, it was vandalised again. I will address the matter with the relevant department of the Setsoto Municipality. Officials will visit the family as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
