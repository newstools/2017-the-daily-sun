HE played for Bafana Bafana, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth.But Aaron &ldquo;Mbazo&rdquo; Mokoena is still defending . . . IN A GRUDGE MATCH AGAINST NEDBANK! Mbazo was taken to court by the bank, which has applied to sell off his house in Vanderbijlpark, in the Vaal, and get back some of the money he owes the credit provider. According to court papers, Mbazo has failed to pay his bond instalment of R5&thinsp;548 since November 2016. The bank claims it has tried everything to get him to pay arrears and outstanding balance. &ldquo;Despite the demand, the respondents failed and/or refused and/or neglected to pay the said sum or any part thereof to the applicant,&rdquo; the bank said in a statement. Mbazo and Anastacia Lerato Mokoena bought the house in 2011 for R800&thinsp;000. Sunday Sun could not establish the relationship Lerato has with Mbazo. But they are cited in court papers as first and second respondents. Now, court papers show that the bond with Nedbank is in arrears of R49&thinsp;824. And the bank wants to kick him out of the house. Nedbank claims Mbazo and Anastacia acknowledged that they owe the money &ndash; but cannot pay. And Nedbank wants the outstanding balance of R508&thinsp;699. If he can&rsquo;t pay, Mbazo&rsquo;s home will go under the hammer. In the South Gauteng High Court, Judge Shangisa ruled that Mbazo must pay with, 10% interest. The bank&rsquo;s papers state that it has been trying to get Mbazo to pay or make an arrangement for the past five months, but to no avail. Nedbank has served papers on Anastacia, who is cited as the second respondent: &ldquo;The process was served on Miss Mokoena (sister of the first respondent and sister-in-law of second respondent).&rdquo; The bank applied to the court to have the house auctioned. But the court postponed request to have the house declared executable for the same amount. It&rsquo;s not the first time Mbazo has been in hot water with a credit provider. In 2013, it was reported that he lost his 2005 BMW X5 to the repo men. He had bought the car through BMW financial services in March 2008 for R590&thinsp;766, with monthly instalments of R8&thinsp;157. But he defaulted, and was in arrears of R47&thinsp;770, owing a total balance of R193&thinsp;007. Mbazo said he was unaware of the court proceedings against him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. In fact, there&rsquo;s no such,&rdquo; he said. Anastacia could not be reached for comment. Nedbank manager Bongani Gonyela said in the affidavit they&rsquo;d sent many letters of demand but were ignored. Gonyela said: &ldquo;The respondent acknowledged their indebtedness to the applicant in the total sum of R520&thinsp;000.&rdquo;
