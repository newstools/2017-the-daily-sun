Real Madrid continue to be linked with a blockbuster move for Chelsea star Eden Hazard, but Ray Wilkins doesn&rsquo;t expect a sale any time soon.Former Real Madrid club president Ram&oacute;n Calder&oacute;n rates that Los Blancos are unlikely to break the bank for the Belgian, despite him fitting within the Galactico policy of transfer spending."I guess if Chelsea are going to let him go they will have to ask for a lot of money," Calder&oacute;n told Sky Sports News HQ. "Chelsea is not a selling club so economically the bar is set very high."Calder&oacute;n believes that any decision is ultimately up to the player, but former Blues player and coach Ray Wilkins insists that Hazard is far too central to their ambitions to be sold at any price."I would imagine Mr Abramovich would not even consider any offer that comes in," Wilkins said, via Sky Sports. "You cannot replace him. If they sell him I'll give up my season ticket. He's that important."It looks a very good front page, but that's about as far as it goes," he said. "For Chelsea to lose Hazard, who is one of the five best players on the planet, they would have to replace this guy and he is irreplaceable at this moment in time."I couldn't give a monkey's what they offer. Chelsea wish to be the best club on the planet and they're heading in the right direction.
