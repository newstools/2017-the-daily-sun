RESIDENTS of Serope, outside Mabopane, northern Tshwane are living in fear.This is because of the increase in armed and house robberies they&rsquo;ve experienced in the past month.The latest shocking incident happened on Saturday night when Patricia Manana (41) was shot dead in her house.An unknown man allegedly shot her through the bathroom window while she was having a bath. The bullet hit her behind her right ear and she immediately fell to the ground.Her son Thabiso (21) said he was in the kitchen when the incident took place.He said it was about 10pm when he heard a loud bang coming from the bathroom.Thabiso said he thought the sound came from the toilet seat lid falling down but he rushed to check what had happened. &ldquo;My mum was lying in a pool of blood.&rdquo; Thabiso said he took a towel and tried to stop the bleeding but it was too late.Patricia was rushed to hospital but was certified dead on arrival.Thabiso told Daily Sun that he was still traumatised by what he had seen.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll ever feel safe again. The killer should have come inside the house and stolen what he wanted instead of shooting my mother.&rdquo;Residents believe the killer was behind last week&rsquo;s shooting in which two teenagers were shot and robbed of their cellphones.They suspect that the same man was also behind the killing of a paramedic.The paramedic was shot while buying food with his colleague and his cellphone was stolen.A resident said the robberies in their area were alarming. and that they don&rsquo;t know how to protect themselves anymore. &ldquo;We live in fear because the killer is among us and the cops can&rsquo;t catch him.&rdquo; Captain Rheineth Motlana, Mabopane police spokeswoman, said a case of murder has been opened but no arrest has been made.
