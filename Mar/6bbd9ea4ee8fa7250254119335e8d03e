Former Golden Arrows winger Clifton Miheso has lodged a complaint with FIFA over claims he was forced to terminate his contract at gunpoint in January.The alleged incident took place at the Premiership club's offices in Durban, where the Kenya international was meeting with chief executive Gordon Masondo.Miheso says he was also instructed to drop a complaint to police and returned to his homeland in a matter of days after fearing for his life, although Abafana Bes'thende subsequently denied the allegations.The 24-year-old's lawyer added that Arrows failed to provide any satisfactory information about the episode, and is seeking roughly R289,000 in unpaid wages as well as a sanction for the KZN outfit.World Players' Union, FIFPro, confirmed that Miheso had taken his case to world football's governing body, who are being urged by South African Football Players Union (SAFPU) to request that the South African Football Association (SAFA) open an investigation to the matter, after their own pleas apparently fell on deaf ears.
