THE court has already found the baby-faced killer of a school principal guilty of murder.And this morning hitman Bonga Skolpati (22) will find out if he will be spending his life behind bars.His co-accused, the dead man&rsquo;s widow Noluthando Baleni, who was also found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder, is also awaiting sentence.Mthatha High Court Acting Judge Mpumelelo Notununu asked for time to reach a decision after hearing argument yesterday.Skolpati (22) faces life in jail after he was found guilty of the October 2015 murder of high school principal Kholisile Baleni.Lawyer Sihle Mzileni said the court should consider his age and that he was a first-time offender.He said his client had only grade 4 and his background drove him to commit crime for money.State prosecutor Nomapha Mvandaba was relentless, however, arguing that Skolpati&rsquo;s personal circumstances could not justify him shooting dead the unarmed victim.Noluthando appeared in front of Judge Richard Brooks just before Skolpati, after her conviction.Social worker Nosakhiwo Ngxaza could not say whether she could be rehabilitated. She told the court the woman&rsquo;s kids said they were struggling financially without a mum or dad. She also said, however, thatthe victim&rsquo;s other children said their stepmum should rot in jail. Brooks has postponed his pre-sentencing to 8 May.
