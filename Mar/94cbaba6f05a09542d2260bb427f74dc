SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said today that she did in fact meet a deadline to submit an affidavit to the Constitutional Court on personal costs in the social grants case. This after reports that she had missed the 4pm deadline.Her attorneys served the 140-page affidavit before 4pm as per the order but had some difficulties emailing it because of its large file size, said Dlamini's spokeswoman Lumka Oliphant."Twenty-six copies of the same had to be hand delivered so as to be filed at court. The court could not accept the filing without confirmation of the electronic service," she said."Unfortunately due to the large size of the file some of the electronic service bounced back and all parties could not be served before 4pm. The electronic service has now been effected to all the parties." Oliphant said that the court was copied in on the email.DA's social development spokewoman, Bridget Masango did not buy Dlamini's explanation."It is irresponsible of her and confirms the view that she is incompetent and disdainful."Earlier in the month, the court handed down a judgment extending Cash Paymaster Service's (CPS) unlawful contract with the Sassa for 12 more months. It suspended its declaration of the invalidity for that period.The court had ordered Dlamini to submit an affidavit by today at the latest to explain why she should not be joined to the case in her personal capacity, and why she should not pay the costs of the parties who brought the case out of her own pocket.Despite the fiasco, Dlamini kept her position after President Jacob Zuma made major changes to his Cabinet in the early hours of this morning.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/dlamini-files-to-concourt-after-email-woes-20170331
