GOGO Shadi Matlala (72) was watching TV with her husband when the appliance suddenly caught fire . . . Shadi, who walks with the aid of crutches, literally leapt from the couch as she hurried to the bedroom to drag her elder sister Rosie to safety!Meanwhile, the fire had spread to her entire lounge and burnt her furniture and valuables.&ldquo;The fire was getting out of control. We had to rush quickly. We could have been burnt to death, had we not acted swiftly,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We suspect this could be vutha because the wiring in this house was intact. I sprained my ankle as I fell. But we thank God for sparing our lives. The three of us managed to escape unharmed.&rdquo;The shocked gogo from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the entire roof was destroyed by the fire.The roof is now covered with a piece of waterproof outdoor plastic that was donated to her.&ldquo;We are afraid that we are going to drown in this house next time it rains because this is a makeshift roof cover. We pray for a Good Samaritan to help us.&rdquo;The walls have cracked and she fears her house might collapse. &ldquo;We are scared to sleep in this house, but we have nowhere else to go.&rdquo; She asked SunReaders to donate a roof.
