THE family of Dumisani Dlamini (22) from Section A3 in Mamelodi West, Tshwane, is fuming. They want his body exhumed so they can give him a proper reburial. They claim he was given a pauper&rsquo;s funeral after being beaten to death by residents of Nellmapius, Tshwane in September. His gogo Martha Makhubo (67) said although he was a nyaope addict and stole from people, he deserved a dignified burial. &ldquo;People have been coming to mourn with us since the news broke of his death. Now we have run out of money to buy them food.&rdquo; She said they no longer know what to tell people when they ask about his funeral. &ldquo;We want the government to exhume his body and pay for the costs. The police have caused this confusion by not notifying us when he was still at the mortuary. We could have buried him and moved on with our lives.&rdquo; The angry gogo said they&rsquo;ve survived on donations from local undertaker Sello Mashile. &ldquo;He has been buying us flour and groceries to bake and cook for people who come to comfort us. He has even promised to bury Dumisani for free once he is exhumed.&rdquo;His brother Mathew Dlamini said the police are adding to his pain. &ldquo;The way my brother died was very painful. But for him to be buried like someone who has no family adds to our pain. This could have been avoided had cops done their job.&rdquo;Captain Jan Sepato, the Silverton police spokesman, said they try various channels to find family members of unidentified corpses. &ldquo;We use newspapers and community radio stations.&ldquo;If no one comes forward the person is buried as an unidentified person.&rdquo;Sepato said the family must contact the City of Tshwane&rsquo;s Municipality if they want help to exhume the body.The City&rsquo;s spokesman, Lindela Mashigo, said the matter will be investigated. He said they will see how they can assist the family.
