NELSON Mandela Bay Municipality has introduced an aggressive campaign to save water because dams are drying up as a result of the drought. But although the municipality has called on residents to save water, it seems its workers are dragging their feet when it comes to fixing leaks which account for the loss of thousands of litres of water.Concerned residents of Sixwila Road in NU8 Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, have complained that water has been leaking from the ground below their communal tap for almost a year. They said the water bubbled up from the ground and the pipe supplying water to the tap seemed to have a leak. Resident Nontembiso Hlathi (58) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of the municipality to run water awareness campaigns, but they also need to practise what they preach. &ldquo;Since last year, many litres of clean water have been lost here.&rdquo; A squatter from the area also said he suspected the pipe supplying the communal tap had a leak. &ldquo;Last year at Easter, I noticed clean water coming from under the ground and flowing into a nearby stormwater drain.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki asked residents to report water leaks immediately. &ldquo;We encourage all residents, including those living in informal settlements, to call 080 020 5050 to report leaks in their kasis or on the roads.&rdquo;
