I was not apointed spokes person for the family and neither did I seek consent from them for posting.I took the matter personally because of my own struggle with the church system. It was really in bad taste that I brought the grieving family unnecessary distress at a time like this. I am pleading that we all excersize some respect hence forth....My apologies also go to the Grace Bible church and its leadership for my recent post. I was not fair to the church and its members."
