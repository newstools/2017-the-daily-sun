WHEN Sonnyboy Moreki became a victim of crime, it left him with many questions.The man from DZ section in Bekkersdal wondered how thugs got past his vicious dog in the first place, and then how they gained entry without breaking anything.His biggest question was why they stole not one electric appliance or any money – but took all his family’s food!Sonnyboy, who works as a school bus driver, said he came home to find all their food gone and the fridge completely empty.The only stuff left to be eaten were six potatoes – one each for him, his wife and their four kids.Angry Sonnyboy (48) said he and his wife always worked carefully within their budget to make sure their kids didn’t go to bed without food.He said the unknown thugs stole groceries like fruit and packs of chicken legs and heads.“I doubt there’s any sense in opening a case, because all the evidence would have gone into their stomachs.“They will have long finished the food by the time we get to court,” said Sonnyboy.“There was no forced entry. It appears the thugs somehow had their own key.“My dog Bully would not let thugs get into my yard.“I wonder what trick they used,” said shocked Sonnyboy.Bekkersdal police spokeswoman Sergeant Linki Lefakane told Daily Sun that while it might seem unimportant and strange that people stole food, it was still a serious offence as the thugs had broken into private property.“I encourage Sonnyboy to come and open a case.“Our fingerprint experts might be able to find prints left by the thugs and determine whether they were involved in other crimes before this.”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuJMDGSbwlvy5EUc7gCvzyT058agR-SfWGS-Z0p0sWhE8g5AnKOi-bZJAhaeH82eAp9ZDG7UOt-c5UGnfnoZIq5xc4qxKXnw3vQkUvooZh0YhrJhH8AGt3damk18Z_rPH2lknhHlIx8-D9o2uqiwuEw0c59kdIk00gtxi0DxoYtBXrSVHShQ7WoA-GJrX0cZmhuNIsbIGoS9T2V3KErgaU8lx6fQz6bFtOOiAZnMcZCk-ZaQ5_yTY1gcdw7QAbKhqzuFZmWdvgr97LkcDxu9iWm5vYNJXA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOXChLHLKYqdEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
