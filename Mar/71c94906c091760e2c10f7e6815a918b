Bloemfontein Celtic have confirmed the appointment of Luc Eymael as their head coach a day after the Belgian tactician tendered&nbsp;his resignation at Polokwane City.Siwelele engaged in negotiations with Eymael on Friday morning and moved swiftly to secure the 57-year-old's services, who has signed a two-and-a-half year contract.&nbsp;It puts an end to Celtic's search for a coach since the departure of Serame Letsoaka last year October, and Eymael who was linked with the taking over the reins at Orlando Pirates, revealed his delight upon joining the club."I&rsquo;m happy to join the team of such incredible stature with massive support," he told the club's official website.&nbsp;"When I first arrived in the country, I somehow had a soft spot for the team purely because of the passion and dedication displayed by the supporters and trust me, I share the same thirst to win. My philosophy is simple, to play good football with appropriate tactical discipline.&nbsp;"I have watched the team before and have seen some exceptionally good players that just need guidance and encouragement to start winning again," he concluded.Eymael will be in Rustenburg to watch his new team play Buya Msuthu in the Nedbank Cup, but will not be sitting on the bench as Lehlohonolo Seema will take charge of the team.&nbsp;
