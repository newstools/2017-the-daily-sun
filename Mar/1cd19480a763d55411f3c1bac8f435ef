the deputy president highlighted yesterday in Parliament. As a government we
are deeply and totally committed that come 1 April, 17 million people must be
given their social grants," he said.Cabinet will only say what its position on the matter is
after the meeting.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini meanwhile
has been summoned to appear before Parliament's standing committee on public
accounts (Scopa). She will appear at  9.00am
on Tuesday.Dlamini did not appear at the scheduled Scopa meeting on
Tuesday along with representatives from her department and Sassa. She also was
not present at a portfolio committee on social development meeting on the same
issue yesterday.DA MP Bridget Masanago, who sits on the portfolio
committee of social development, said if Dlamini fails to accept the
invitation, she will "once again prove that the ANC does not care about
the poor and vulnerable in our society". http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cabinet-to-hold-sassa-meeting-next-week-radebe-20170302
