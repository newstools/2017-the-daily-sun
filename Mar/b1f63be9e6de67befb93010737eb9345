YOUNG mum Nomthandazo Ntuli is still hopeful that police divers will find her son&rsquo;s body. She has hope despite knowing that the river into which her son, a grade 9 pupil at Nyakane High School, fell and drowned is home to dangerous crocodiles. Zamani Ndwandwe (14) from Emacambini Village in Mandeni, northern KZN fell into the Tugela River when he went to find sticks in the nearby bush with three of his friends on Sunday. Nomthandazo (29) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I trust that police divers will find him even though people believe the crocodiles have already eaten him. I have put my trust in God. I pray that he will show mercy to me and make sure my son&rsquo;s body is found so that I can give him a dignified funeral.&rdquo; She said it feels as if death called her son, because he did not like going with friends. &ldquo;He has always been the kind of child who stayed indoors, but on Sunday he was keen to go to a village stick fight with friends,&rdquo; said Nomthandazo. &ldquo;They told me they were looking in the bush for fresh sticks for the fight when the incident happened.&rdquo; She said Zamani&rsquo;s friends told her they did not want to get into the river when her son drowned as they knew it was dangerous. She said instead they rushed to tell her, and she in turn then notified the village men and the police, who immediately started to search for him. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s body has not been found. The police search and rescue team is still searching.&rdquo;
