FIVE people were injured by rubber bullets during a protest in&nbsp;Reiger Park yesterday. The residents of the area in Ekurhuleni were protesting against the new Leeuwpoort Housing Project, which they said they were not benefitting from. They claimed corrupt officials in the housing department were giving houses to foreigners and had told them no Reiger Park residents would be accommodated in the project. About 2 000 protesters closed the entrances and exits to the area. Tyres, wood and even concrete structures were burned and used as barricades. Cops were soon at the scene and started shooting rubber bullets and teargas. When the situation calmed down, protesters regrouped for a march to the Boksburg municipal offices to voice their grievances. Resident Yvonne Pillay (44) said they had been waiting for houses for years. &ldquo;Coloureds are not recognised. We will die before we have houses while foreigners have houses. We need answers or we will continue protesting,&rdquo; she said. Member of the mayoral committee for human settlements Lesiba Mpya told protesters it was not true that Reiger Park residents would not benefit from the Leeuwpoort project. &ldquo;People of Reiger Park, I want to let you know that you are part of the plans,&rdquo; he said. Matilda Gasela from Gauteng human settlements said: &ldquo;We will assign senior officials to meet with the community and hear their complaints. Houses are only allocated to South African citizens and not foreign nationals.&rdquo;
