This is totally unacceptable in a democratic country. We were shocked to discover that the department is funding Algoa Frail Old Age Centre with R18 000 per person. This has a negative effect on kasi old age homes.” Eastern Cape Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi accepted the memorandum. “We only discovered this disgrace two years ago.“However, we were not in a position to terminate the contract.“We can’t continue to uphold white supremacy at the expense of black people.“Our legal team is currently negotiating with the national office to sort this out. “We will give you a full report as soon as we can,” she said.Mzukisi Solani, spokesman for social development, said: “We had a contract with Eastern Cape Frail Care, a private company that was dealing with old age homes. “However our contract with them expired in December and we didn’t renew it due to problems.”
