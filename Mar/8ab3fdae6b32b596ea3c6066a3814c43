PEOPLE have been in the dark since their electricity went off on Friday afternoon. The outage affected the T and S sections of Uganda squatter camp in Umlazi, south of Durban. The problem was caused by an explosion and a fire at Isipingo substation. Nomzamo Mbewana (37), the owner of a spaza shop, told Daily Sun he was forced to close his shop. &ldquo;I usually sell fast foods but my customers have been starving since Friday. &ldquo;This situation is robbing me of my income.&rdquo; Njabulo Kweyama (49) from T section said he had not had a decent meal since Friday.&ldquo;The food is rotting in my fridge. &ldquo;We are begging eThekwini Municipality to hurry up and fix the damage. The street lights are out, which might lead to an increase in crime,&rdquo; he said. He said no one knew what caused the explosion. &ldquo;We heard a huge bang on Friday afternoon and the electricity suddenly went out. Nothing has been said to us about when the substation will be fixed.&rdquo; When the SunTeam drove around the area, dark smoke marks were visible on the outside of the station. The municipality said an investigation into the cause of the explosion, which caused R5 million worth of damage, was under way. Raj Dhrochand of the electricity department said temporary emergency repairs were in progress and electricity had already been restored in some affected areas. &ldquo;The repairs were hampered by rain over the weekend. &ldquo;Power will soon be back in the remaining areas. &ldquo;The electricity supply will remain vulnerable until permanent repairs are undertaken in the coming months.&rdquo;
