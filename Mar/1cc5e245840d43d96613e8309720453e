<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>It was a joyous day when Mayenziwe Nyawo (20) came home to tell her mum she was expecting twins.Her mother, Loraine Nyawo (57) from Inhlwathi Village, near Umkhanyakude in northern KZN, said she was certain Mayenziwe was carrying twins because she had seen her daughter’s scans from Inhlwathi Clinic after checkups.But when Mayenziwe gave birth at Hlabisa Hospital, she was given only ONE baby, whose face was bruised and who required stitches.Mayenziwe told her mum the the hospital couldn’t give her answers about that either, just telling her she must have the stiches removed at the clinic. Since April last year, Mayenziwe has desperately been searching for answers about the missing twin.Any mum can imagine the the horror of not knowing what happened. But no one was interested in the young mum’s anguish.At Hlabisa Hospital, they told her she had definitely only had a single baby, but said her file had been lost. The clinic in Inhlwathi, Hlabisa, where Mayenziwe had been a patient during her pregnancy, told her they had ALSO lost her file and could no longer confirm any details!But the nightmare was only beginning.Loraine told Daily Sun that Mayenziwe got excited when she received a phone call from a man who said he was a lawyer and could help her.“He said he had found out about her fight with the hospital over her missing twin and he wanted to represent her legally. “She went to meet the man in Empangeni because he seemed to have all the information about our struggle.”Loraine said Mayenziwe trusted the man because he seemed to be informed when he spoke to her. She took all the documents relating to her pregnancy with her.“She was desperate for a legal representative because everything was happening in a very strange way and she was not getting any answers. She felt she needed someone who understands these things.” Mayenziwe left with hope in her heart.“But that was the last time I saw her,” Loraine said, choking back tears.Since then, Mayenziwe’s phone has been on voicemail. KZN Department of Health spokesman, Sam Mkhwanazi said as far as the department is aware, the patient delivered a single baby on 30 April 2016, not twins. “The department can’t comment on the health or clinical management of any of its patients as the law does not permit the department to discuss such confidential information with a third party, including the media,” he said.He advised the relatives or next of kin to report the matter of the missing person to the SAPS.KZN police spokeswoman, Captain Nqobile Gwala, confirmed that Ezibayeni police are investigating a case of kidnapping, after Mayenziwe Nyawo (20), left home on 16 February to meet a man in Empangeni and never returned home.“No arrest has been made at this stage and investigations are continuing,” said Gwala.
