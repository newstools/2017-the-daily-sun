RESIDENTS took to the streets yesterday, claiming they had been locked out of a ward meeting. People of ward 43 in Lindelani, north of Durban, demanded that eThekwini Municipality reject the outcome of Sunday&rsquo;s meeting at Sondelani Sports Field, held to elect a ward committee. The ward includes Lindelani and parts of Ntuzuma, but Lindelani residents were locked out by Ntuzuma residents and Councillor Nelisiwe Mhlongo. Protester Wawa Mothiba (48) said: &ldquo;Nobody formally announced it. &ldquo;Mhlongo was there and when we asked that she intervene, she insulted us. She said we were stupid. &ldquo;She said we didn&rsquo;t know how to tell time and notices had been put on street poles to advertise the meeting.&rdquo; Mazwi Mantinga (32) said: &ldquo;The councillor and her people deliberately left us out. They want to continue electing people we don&rsquo;t want behind our backs. &ldquo;The councillor is rude and talks to people anyhow. We want to report to the municipality things she has done wrong.&rdquo; Mhlongo denied swearing at residents and being rude. &ldquo;When a ward committee is elected, the councillor attends as an observer, so why would I swear at them? They are also lying about not being told about the meeting,&rdquo; Mhlongo said. Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said cops were monitoring the situation. Municipal speaker William Mapena, according to a statement issued by the municipality, will investigate the allegations against the councillor. &ldquo; The municipality does issue objection forms where residents are offered an opportunity to lodge a complaint to the speaker,&rdquo; it said.
