THE minnows might pull out nasty surprises when they meet Premier Soccer League&rsquo;s (PSL) big guns in the Nedbank Cup&rsquo;s last 32 round.The highly-anticipated competition starts tomorrow when African champions Mamelodi Sundowns host unknown Limpopo side Mariveni United at Lucas Moripe Stadium (7.30pm).&nbsp; In fact, most PSL teams who face lower league sides should be worried. Downs are still reeling from a 1-0 league defeat to Cape Town City on Friday. We&rsquo;ve witnessed some historic moments in the past few years during this competition.The ABC Motsepe League and SAB League teams have also surpassed expectations, proving they also deserve to be treated with respect. In 2011, Baroka FC were one of the surprise packages.As underdogs, they did the unexpected by defeating two Soweto giants (Moroka Swallows and Kaizer Chiefs) by the same margin (2-1) to reach the semi-finals. But Baroka are still campaigning in the Vodacom League, now known as the ABC Motsepe League.Two years later, another lower league side, Maluti FET College, booted out Orlando Pirates 4-1 in the last 32 round.Reigning champions, SuperSport United, begin their title defence on 15 March against tricky National First Division (NFD) side Royal Eagles at Harry Gwala.Amakhosi will also meet NFD side Stellenbosch FC, while Pirates tackle Eastern Cape Bees from the SAB League.Mariveni United director, Tsakani Hlungwane, admits they might not match the Brazilians pound-for-pound, but they will give them a run for their money.&ldquo;Playing against a team like Sundowns is a motivation on its own. We know what they can do, but it won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park for them,&rdquo; said Hlungwane. This week&rsquo;s fixtures:Tomorrow: Mamelodi Sundowns v Mariveni United (Lucas Moripe, 7.30pm).
