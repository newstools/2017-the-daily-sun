PRESSURE is mounting on Polokwane City and Baroka FC to bring back the smile to their Limpopo loyal fans!Both teams are gunning for each other&rsquo;s throat hoping to improve their position on the Absa Premiership table.&nbsp; The teams will battle it out in a Limpopo derby at Peter Mokaba Stadium today (3.30pm).The Limpopo rivals haven&rsquo;t tasted a win in 2017 adding more pressure to their coaches Kgoloko Thobejane and Luc Eymael. Therefore this game has a lot at stake considering that Baroka are desperate for points to move away from the bottom of table, while City are eager to maintain their position within the top eight.&nbsp;Bakgaka coach Kgoloko Thobejane knows that there is a lot at stake, including bragging rights. This derby doesn&rsquo;t have a shortage of goals as the previous derby produced four goals when the teams drew 2-2.&nbsp;Thobejane said: &ldquo;A derby is always a difficult game to plan for. But I cannot afford to be beaten by my neighbour. We will for sure be attacking more as there is a lot at stake for us.&rdquo; Thobejane also revealed that former Bloemfontein Celtic and Orlando Pirates striker Helder Pelembe could make his long awaited debut after his working permit issue was resolved.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;We have been having problems with converting goals since the start of the season and I am glad that Pelembe&rsquo;s working permit was finally finalized. He is ready to play and I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t use him.&rdquo;The Rise and Shine mentor Luc Eymael said he won&rsquo;t take things for granted despite being the favourites going to today&rsquo;s clash.Eymael said: &ldquo;It is always special going to the derby, but I told my players not to undermine Baroka. I think they will bring 200% performance into the match and I expect my players to do the same. &ldquo;The players know it is about the pride of the province, team and fans. If we want to make this derby exciting like the previous one we need to go all out. Baroka won&rsquo;t make it easy for us and we know that.&rdquo;
