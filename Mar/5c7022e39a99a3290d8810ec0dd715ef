SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini appeared today before Parliament&rsquo;s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) in a frustrating back-and-forth meeting.Dlamini denied reports that a new social grants distribution contract has been finalised with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).She said there were still four terms of the contract that need to be finalised.She could not give information on what the new contract would cost per grant recipient. The current rate is R16,44 per recipient.She could also not confirm what legal deductions the new service provider would be allowed to make under the new agreement.What she could confirm is that the new contract with CPS will last for two years.The department's technical task team, which includes a state law advisor, is currently reviewing the terms of the new contract and will report back on Friday.Thereafter, the department will make a public announcement on the new deal with CPS.She could not comment on whether Treasury would support the new contract, as required by the Public Finance Management Act, and said Treasury must speak for itself.Dlamini admitted that the department had underestimated the amount of work they had to do.Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said at the beginning of the meeting that the committee was primarily interested in "how we got here".Dlamini also frustrated MPs when she asked to leave the committee before 11.00am so she could make it to a Cabinet meeting."This is not church where you preach and we just say 'amen' and go home," EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. "The minister must account," he demanded.Dlamini then stayed until the end of the meeting.ANC MP Nyami Booi assured the minister that Scopa would continue to "mentor" them, as it was clear that Sassa needed help with the grants crisis."We will babysit you, don't worry," he said.He said it was important that Sassa remained Parliament's baby, and wasn't hijacked by an external party.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/cps-negotiations-not-over-dlamini-20170307
