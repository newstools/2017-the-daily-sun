THUGS have found a new way to rob people. They pretend to sell perfume but when they spray it for customers to smell, it knocks them out! Apparently, the thugs talk their way into victims&rsquo; homes and then convince them to smell the perfume, which is actually a substance that makes them dizzy. The robbers then take whatever they want from the house. The latest incident happened in Dobsonville, Soweto over the weekend when gogo Marriam Hleza (61) was robbed of her cellphone and money by the fake perfume thugs. She told Daily Sun she didn&rsquo;t remember much about the incident, but did recall people coming into her yard to sell perfume. The next thing she knew she was lying on the kitchen floor and her belongings were gone. &ldquo;I was in the kitchen on Saturday afternoon when a man and woman came knocking on the back door. They had a paper bag with perfumes in it. They insisted that I smell their products, even though I wasn&rsquo;t interested in buying anything. &ldquo;The next thing I knew I woke up on my kitchen floor with the door open. I soon realised they had robbed me. People must not allow these crooks in their yards or they&rsquo;ll be sorry.&rdquo; According to the cops, similar incidents have been reported in the Joburg CBD. A case of robbery was opened at Dobsonville cop shop and police are investigating.
