THE skeletons of 11 Zulu warriors and British soldiers that were discovered in a mass grave near Isandlwana Mountain in Nquthu, north of KZN about a year ago will be dignified with a monument in April.This emerged on Saturday during the demonstration of the Isandlwana Battle. The annual event is held to show the current generation how the Zulu warriors defeated the British soldiers who tried to invade the land back in 1879.The CEO of the KZN Arts and Culture Trust, Gugu kaMavundla Ngcobo said they have agreed with the Zulu Royal Household that a monument was the best way to honour the warriors. &ldquo;We concluded that not even one bone should be unearthed for DNA tests because we would need to find their relatives. That could take forever, considering that the battle took place 138 years ago.&rdquo; The grave was found when ecologists surveyed the land to find out if it was a good idea to build a village to honour the warriors. Ngcobo said apart from the monument and a village, King Cetshwayo&rsquo;s statue and a museum will be built near the mountain. Royal household spokesman Prince Thulani Zulu agreed that the king fully supported the decision.
