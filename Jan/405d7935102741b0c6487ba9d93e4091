WHEN the pitbull grabbed his daughter on Saturday, Lawrence Gulele jumped on the dog to save her, but the beast wouldn&rsquo;t let go.&nbsp; However, the 38-year-old father got help from an unexpected source &ndash; another dog!&nbsp; Lawrence, from KwaThema in Ekurhuleni, said even when he beat the dog with a golf stick, it wouldn&rsquo;t leave his three-year-old daughter, Sbahle Madi.&nbsp; He had to think quickly.&nbsp; So he decided to throw his own dog, Dorcas, at the pitbull to fight it off.&nbsp; While Dorcas attracted the angry dog&rsquo;s attention, he was able to grab little Sbahle.&nbsp; Lawrence and Sbahle were both rushed to hospital for treatment as they had been bitten by the pitbull.&nbsp; The dog was taken away by the SPCA as it was a danger to the community.&nbsp; Officials from the SPCA warned residents not to keep dangerous animals as they could kill children.&nbsp; Lawrence said his daughter was going to the toilet when the dog grabbed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tried to fight it off but it was vicious.&nbsp; &ldquo;My daughter was screaming, but the dog wouldn&rsquo;t leave her alone.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had no choice but to fight with it to release my daughter,&rdquo; ,he said.&nbsp;Lawrence said his daughter was left traumatised by the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has nightmares about a dog attacking her and we wish we could send her for counselling. I thank my dog Dorcas for standing up to that vicious animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; No case was opened as no one knows who owns the dog.&nbsp; Captain Thabo Sibuyi, a police spokesman, said the dog was from a yard in the area but said cops were still trying to locate the owner.&nbsp;
