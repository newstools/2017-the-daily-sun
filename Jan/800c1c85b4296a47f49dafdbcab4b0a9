Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho believes that midfielder Paul Pogba has the required talent and temperament to one day captain the Premier League giants.After a somewhat underwhelming start to life at Old Trafford, the France international has played a pivotal role in the Red Devils' nine-match winning run, which has seen them move to within touching distance of the EPL's Champions League places.The 23-year-old, who joined United for a world record fee of &pound;89m in the off-season, has impressed Mourinho with his professional attitude."I think he has the charisma, the ambition, the mentality," the Portuguese tactician told reporters when asked if he felt that Pogba could one day skipper the side."He is a good professional. Being so young and with so many ingredients, I think he can."He added: "It is not fair to say a player has to be dominant."He [Pogba] is playing amazingly well, yes. No doubts about it. But the team is also playing well."I am not expecting the team to play really bad and for one player to have all the weight on his shoulders, not Paul, not anyone."I expect the team to play well and Paul to be at the level he is playing now regularly."The Red Devils return to action on Sunday when they lock horns with bitter rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford.
