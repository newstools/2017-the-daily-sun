WHEN Agnes Mahlangu realised there were a lot of people looking for somewhere to live, she came up with a clever idea. The 48-year-old from Delmore squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, built a three-storey mkhukhu, which houses 40 people! Agnes told Daily Sun the structure took her less than three years to build.She first had the idea when she started renting out shacks in 2000.Then more and more people started pestering her for places to live. &ldquo;They bothered me even though I told them I had no place to accommodate them.&rdquo; Agnes added a second floor in 2004 and the third floor the following year. The mkhukhu even has an entertainment area where tenants can play snooker and watch television.The electricity comes from solar panels and the third floor has a washing area. When the SunTeam visited Agnes&rsquo; mkhukhu, the stairs were difficult to climb and it felt a bit unsteady on the upper floors. However, Agnes said her tenants were not scared because they were used to it. She said even though she and her tenants had been living in the mkhukhu for years, there had not once been a shack fire. &ldquo;We make sure that everyone who lives here is educated about fire safety. Every night before I go to sleep, I knock on the door of each tenant to make sure all paraffin stoves and candles have been put out because one mistake can kill us all.&rdquo; When Agnes showed the SunTeam the washing-line on the roof, she said: &ldquo;I love it up here because I can see the whole kasi.&rdquo;
