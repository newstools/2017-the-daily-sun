AMAZULU head coach Joey Antipas says there is a good reason why he is not busy in the market in this transfer window. Usuthu, who are in fourth position in the National First Division log table, have only acquired the services of two players to fill in for two who have departed. Striker Roggert Nyundu and defender Stephen Makatuka both joined AmaZulu in December, but had to wait until the January transfer window opened to be registered by the Premier Soccer League. The two will immediately slot in for Siphesihle Nzimande and Allen Robertson, who were released by the Durban outfit earlier this month.Former Black Leopards marksman Nyundu and Makatuka would soon be joined by a midfielder with whom Usuthu were still negotiating, said Antipas. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>“Yes, it is true that we are not as busy as usual in this transfer window. “Honestly, I don’t see a reason to add that many players, since I’ve already have a good squad. I don’t want bring in too many faces, because that will make my work more difficult. “It would mean I would have to start all over again.“I only need three players. I’ve already signed two and now I need a box-to-box midfielder. There’s one that we are in negotiations with at moment. We will see how it goes. “If I don’t get him, it won’t be a train smash. I will just continue with the players I have,” explained the coach. The release of former University of Pretoria striker Nzimande came as a surprise to many. The player from Ntuzuma in Durban joined Usuthu as a free agent in September after leaving AmaTuks at the the end of last season.Antipas said:”I really don’t want to talk about his issue. It’s between him and the management. And it has to do with discipline.”The Zimbabwean coach added that he was pleased with the condition his players were in when they returned from a short festive break. AmaZulu started preparing for the remainder of their NFD matches last week. “I’m pleased to see that the players followed the programmes we gave them when they left for Christmas break. “They are looking good at training, there isn’t too much for me to do. We just continued from where we left off without any difficulty.”Usuthu will resume their NFD campaign away to AmaTuks at Tuks Stadium on 11 February (3.30pm).
