TEACHERS at Naleni High School in Umlazi, south of Durban abandoned classes to force the principal to listen to them.On Thursday and Friday, there was allegedly no teaching and learning at the school. The teachers allegedly vowed to only go back to class when the principal meets their demands.The teachers claimed the principal is ignorant and doesn&rsquo;t care about the condition of the school, which they described as filthy.&ldquo;Some of the classes have no doors and the school is dirty and smelly. No one looks after the grass. Toilets are also without doors, therefore there&rsquo;s no privacy. Everyone sees us when we relieve ourselves in the toilet,&rdquo; said a teacher.Another teacher revealed that pupils each pay R400 in school fees but the money is not used to clean up the school.&ldquo;The school fee is enough to fix broken doors, windows and other damaged things. But this school is in a bad condition, although pupils pay school fees,&rdquo; said the teacher.SGB chairwoman Ntombifuthi Ndlovu said they would meet parents and talk about what should be done at the school.&ldquo;Teachers are not happy. We are also not happy as we have held several meetings with the principal to discuss the school&rsquo;s condition. It hurts us that our children are abandoned by their teachers. We are still going to meet with the parents to try and get a solution,&rdquo; said Ndlovu.KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said teachers knew the right channels to voice their concerns.&ldquo;We condemn the abandonment of classes by teachers because we take that as violating the pupils&rsquo; right to education,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.&ldquo;We are still waiting for a formal report and we will intervene.&rdquo;
