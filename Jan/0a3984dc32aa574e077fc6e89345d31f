IN 2015 they made a special arrangement with the education department to write their matric exams. But the former pupils of Lekoa Shandu Secondary School in Sharpeville, Vaal are still waiting for their results.It happened after the department identified 30 pupils who would not be able to pass all their matric subjects. They were given a chance to write some of their subjects in the final exams of 2015 and others last year. The pupils wrote some subjects in 2015 and received the results.But when they went to write the remaining subjects last year, they didn&rsquo;t get their results. Morathi Masentle (23) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been sitting at home with nothing to show. &ldquo;We were told to sign agreements and promised assistance, but last year they forgot about us. &ldquo;We even paid for our own study material. Other pupils have received their results, but not us. &ldquo;The department has failed us.&rdquo; Parent Kedibone Tsole (44) said: &ldquo;Our kids are sitting at home without any papers showing they completed matric.&ldquo;We want to know when the kids will get their results so they don&rsquo;t miss out on opportunities at the beginning of the year.&rdquo; Dorah Moloi, district director of education in Sedibeng, said she would be speaking to the pupils, their parents and the principal of Lekoa Shandu. &ldquo;The system allows for pupils who are struggling to write half of their subjects in one year and finish the others in the next cycle.&ldquo;The policy for this system is still being developed although it has already been done at other schools.&rdquo;The pupils were told that they had to wait for a month before they would get their results.
