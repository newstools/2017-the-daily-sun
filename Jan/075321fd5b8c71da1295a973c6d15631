IT IS a blessing that Louisa Mochumi has found refuge in an old age home, but now she needs more help.Lydia Mothobi, founder of the Thebe-Ya Tlhajwa Home in Koffiekraal, North West heard about the gogo locked in her house and made a place for her at the home.While Louisa is happy where she is, she is very big and can&rsquo;t do anything on her own. Social workers came to see her and promised to send her to a home in Sonop, near Brits, but never returned.Lydia told Daily Sun they had to join two beds together to accommodate her.The gogo is paralysed after a stroke and is diabetic.&ldquo;When the gogo needs to go to the clinic we have to hire an open bakkie to transport her. Local nurses and caregivers refuse to come here to assist.&ldquo;Nurses at the Koffiekraal clinic insist she must be brought for regular check-ups, but when we get her there, they nurse her outside because no one wants to lift her,&rdquo; said Lydia. She said she would be happy to learn to check gogo&rsquo;s blood pressure and collect her medicine but nurses say they must see the patient.Louisa, whose home is at Madikwe, 10km from Koffiekraal, said: &ldquo;I get food and am taken care of. There are people to talk to but I need to be looked after by medical people. I am happy here, but if they get me better service, that will be good.&rdquo;Health spokesman Tebogo Lekgethwane said: &ldquo;The gogo will be visited by local area health workers to assess her situation.&rdquo;
