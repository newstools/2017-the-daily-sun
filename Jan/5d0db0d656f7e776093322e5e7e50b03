THE ANC stalwarts believe the system used to elect party leaders could be fuelling bad behaviour among leaders and encouraging lack of accountability.In a document released yesterday titled For the Sake of our Future, the stalwarts said they want the system to be changed. They suggested the change could solve the challenges faced by the ruling party.Speaking at a media conference in Parktown, Joburg, former safety and security minister Sydney Mufamadi said their suggested system is one that guarantees public representatives are held accountable to the organisation and the country. He said the party also needs to determine whether its system makes it difficult for elected officials to remain true to the principles of good governance.He agreed with President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s remarks about the need to return the power to elect leaders to the branches.Mufamadi said party members must have the final say on who should lead the party.Another stalwart, the Reverend Frank Chikane, said they will be meeting the ANC&rsquo;s top six leaders on Monday to continue the talks they started last year.Chikane said they had decided to intervene because they want to change the direction of the party. He said one of the issues they will address is the consultative conference which the veterans want separated from the policy conference scheduled for June.
