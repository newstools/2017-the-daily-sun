A MONKEY is a wild animal and is harmless if left alone.But when residents of Spooktown in Westonaria saw one in their kasi, they immediately suspected that evil was in progress. Fearing the beast would curse their kasi, they chased it, cornered it and hacked it to pieces!The national SPCA condemned the incident that happened on Friday, saying it was a crime. But residents disagreed. One of them, Themba Joli (33) told Daily Sun the crowd used all sorts of weapons to kill the monkey.&ldquo;We just saw the monkey and thought it was an evil creature coming to destroy our lives. We chased it and then some people killed it. Others cut off its head and tail to sell to sangomas,&rdquo; said Themba.SPCA spokeswoman Christine Kuch said cruelty to animals is a crime. &ldquo;There is no reason to harm an animal in this situation, no matter how afraid people may be or what their beliefs are. If residents spot such an animal in their area, they should just leave it alone as it will find its way out. SPCA stands for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Prevention is key,&rdquo; said Kuch.She advised people to have their nearest local SPCA&rsquo;s telephone number handy and to call them in such a situation.&ldquo;Our trained representatives can immediately step in and also help to educate people about these harmless animals.&rdquo;
