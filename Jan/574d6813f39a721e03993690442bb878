WHEN customers visit this local tavern to booze, the slippery algae in the water makes life difficult.The water comes from underneath the yard and runs through the gate of Sithole&rsquo;s Tavern in J section, KwaMashu, north of Durban.But owner gogo Ntombizonke Sithole (71) said she doesn&rsquo;t know where it comes from. She said the problem started early last year and it keeps getting worse as the algae is growing each day.&ldquo;When the problem started I was worried, because I thought the water bill would be high. But I noticed nothing changing on my bill. I then realised the water came from underneath my fence, but I&rsquo;m not sure where from exactly.&rdquo; She said this has affected her fence walls and most importantly, her customers. &ldquo;Six customers have slipped and fallen since the problem began. Some customers were seriously injured. If there was a way the water could be stopped, I would be happy. If it isn&rsquo;t fixed, it will end up ruining my house and destroying my walls. I would appreciate the municipality sorting it out. My customers will leave me if it isn&rsquo;t fixed.&rdquo; Regular customer Ntombi Ntshiza (61) said she fell and was injured in December.&ldquo;I had finished drinking and was heading home. I forgot about the water. I fell on my bum and got hurt. Although it wasn&rsquo;t serious, I still feel the pain because I am a gogo.&rdquo; She said the water was a problem for a whole year. &ldquo;This is our drinking spot. &ldquo;No thugs come here. If the water problem does not get fixed we will have to go elsewhere to get our booze,&rdquo; she said.eThekwini Municipality&rsquo;s Princess Nkabane acknowledged the SunTeam&rsquo;s enquiry about the problem and said she had forwarded it to the relevant city unit.
