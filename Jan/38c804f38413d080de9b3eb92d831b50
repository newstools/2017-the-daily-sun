A BATTLE over the ownership of a family house has turned ugly!This is after two siblings apparently vowed to kill one another, rather than allow the other to take ownership of the family place in Jabulani, Soweto. Speaking to Daily Sun from a friend&rsquo;s place, where she ran to hide, Nompi Nkosi said she was recently stabbed by her brother, Sipho. &ldquo;He told me he&rsquo;d fight to the death for the house,&rdquo; she claimed.She said she has been looking after the house for more than eight years since their gogo&rsquo;s death. She said: &ldquo;I moved there with my children and my late sister&rsquo;s children.&ldquo;Now this man, who came from nowhere, has kicked us out to live there with his girlfriend.&ldquo;He came as someone visiting but soon told us that we needed to make space for him and his girlfriend.&ldquo;He built a shack for us in the back.&rdquo;Nompi said when she refused to move out she found all her belongings moved out of the house into the shack.&ldquo;When I reminded him that this was a family house he took out a knife and stabbed me in the head.&rdquo; Nompi reported the matter to the local police station and a protection order was issued against Sipho.Nompi is now stranded with her three children and her sister&rsquo;s children.Daily Sun contacted Sipho Nkosi, who said that Nompi was crazy. &ldquo;She expects me to take care of children that are not mine. &ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t she take her many children to their fathers. &ldquo;With regard to the stabbing, we went to the police station where the matter was resolved.&rdquo; Keith Khoza, spokesman for the Department of Human Settlements, said the two needed to take the matter to a civil court, where they could contest the ownership of the house. &ldquo;The court will determine who is the rightful beneficiary of the house.&rdquo;
