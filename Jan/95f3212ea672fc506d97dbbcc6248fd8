PSL amends fixturesTHE stop-start in the 2016-17 Absa Premiership has compelled the Premier Soccer League to release an amended fixture list for the remainder of the season. The amended version includes the fixtures that were either postponed or abandoned in the first round of the league such as the Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates match that was postponed due to the #FeesMustFall campaign last year. This will now be the first match this year on 3 February at the Bidvest Stadium while the other teams will resume their league duties four days later.The PSL said in a statement that it has been necessary to take into account external factors such as the Olympic Games, the Africa Cup of Nations, and the impact that Mamelodi Sundowns achievements had on the league programme. The amended fixture list also accommodates Sundowns, Wits, Platinum Stars and SuperSport United who will be participating in the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup respectively.Galacticos humbled!Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane urged his side to put their disappointment of a first defeat in 40 games behind them as Sevilla produced a remarkable late turnaround to breathe new life into the Spanish title race with a 2-1 win on Sunday. Victory also takes Sevilla a point above Barcelona into second, but Madrid still have a game in hand on both.&ldquo;I have to be very proud of them all for what we have done until now. &ldquo;We know this was going to happen some day, it is today, and now we have to continue working hard in all competitions,&rdquo; Zidane said.
