ROBBERS have struck four shopping malls in Cape Town since the beginning of the festive season. The latest incident took place at Gugulethu Mall on New Year&rsquo;s Eve and was like a scene from an action movie. Three armed robbers entered the control room in the middle of the night and tied up the security guard. They ordered him to use his radio to call other mall guards to the control room. Upon arrival, the guards were ordered to lie down and were handcuffed with their own handcuffs. The thugs then broke into several shops and looted them. They loaded the stolen stuff into six vehicles. This included cellphones, liquor, clothing, TVs and electronic equipment. They also took money.Before leaving, they poured water on the computers in the control room. Anyone with information about the robbery is asked to call the police on 021 684 2300.
