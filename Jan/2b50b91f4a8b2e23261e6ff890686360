The Burger King-sponsored South African Men National U20 team (Amajita) has secured two friendly matches against Mali as they build up to the 2017 CAF U20 Africa Cup of Nations in Zambia next month. &nbsp; The matches against the West Africans will take place on 16 and 19 February at Peter Mokaba Stadium. &nbsp; And before the two games against Mali, Amajita will travel to Ndola, Zambia for another friendly match against Zambia that will be played on 8 February 2017. &nbsp; U20 national coach Thabo Senong said he was excited to have secured friendly matches against hosts Zambia and Mali. &nbsp; &ldquo;We are very happy to have secured these matches and I believe we will gain a lot of momentum with these friendly matches against Zambia and Mali. We have two West African teams in our group, so these matches will assist us in addressing some strengths and weakness of the West Africans. &nbsp; &ldquo;In the match against Zambia, we will be looking more at ourselves. We need the players to gain confidence in the box, we need our midfielders and defenders to play as a unit and we need to re-emphasize the levels of fitness,&rdquo; said Senong. &nbsp; Amajita will begin their first phase of preparations this coming Thursday, 26 January 2017 before travelling to Zambia for an international friendly. &nbsp; The team will then break camp for a few days before regrouping for the second phase of preparations on 13 February 2017 where they will pitch tent in Limpopo and play the two matches against Mali. &nbsp; The first match against the Eagles of Mali will be played behind closed doors, on 16 February 2017 and kicks-off at 19h00 while the official international friendly will take place on Sunday, 19 February 2017. &nbsp; Kickoff is scheduled for 15h00 and entrance will be free. &nbsp;
