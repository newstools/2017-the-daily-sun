Chicken Inn have gone to FIFA in order to try and recover the 30 per cent transfer fee they claim Mpumalanga Black Aces owe them for Tendai Ndoro.The Zimbabwean club claims that when Ndoro was sold to Black Aces in 2013, a clause was written into the contract stating that the Bulawayo-based team would receive 30 per cent of any future move made by the player, within a five-year period.The Warriors international signed for Orlando Pirates in June 2015 and after an initial slow start, has become the deadliest striker in the South African Premiership in 2016.But Chicken Inn say they have not been paid their cut by an Aces side which sold their top-flight franchise to Cape Town City around seven months ago for a fee that would not likely be less than R100 million.Chicken Inn chairman Lifa Ncube told&nbsp;Chronicle Sport&nbsp;that the Gamecocks have taken their case to the FIFA Players' Status Committee after having failed to get any joy from the South African Football Association (SAFA)."We've approached FIFA because we were not getting any joy after going through SAFA. We felt we were given a raw deal because when Ndoro moved we were supposed to get a certified copy of his transfer agreement, which never happened. We are now waiting for FIFA to make a ruling," said Ncube.FIFA have confirmed they will be looking into the matter:"We would like to inform both parties that we will proceed to submit the present matter to the single judge of the Players' Status Committee, Mr Geoff Thompson (England)," read a letter from Laura Romer-Zantonelli, a Players' Status Committee legal counsel&nbsp;representative.
