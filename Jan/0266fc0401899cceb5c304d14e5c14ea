DEFENDING their MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) crown was never top priority for champions Golden Arrows this season, says Andile Fikizolo.Fikizolo, who plays for the club&rsquo;s senior and MDC teams, said their main plan this season was to introduce players from their Under-19 team to football in the senior ranks. &ldquo;The technical team made it clear from the beginning that this season would be all about grooming U-19 players for next season,&rdquo; said Fikizolo. The speedy winger was part of the Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende team that won the MDC (PSL reserve league) last season fresh from the National First Division. All those players now form part of the first team that head coach Clinton Larsen is relying on to make sure he gets that top eight spot come end of the season. &ldquo;You may have noticed, apart from me it&rsquo;s only Nduduzo Sibiya and Siyabonga Dube who are still involved in both teams this season. &ldquo;We are always willing to come and lend a hand in the MDC. We want to make sure the new boys get comfortable. He added: &ldquo;Arrows&rsquo; philosophy is all about development. And that is why the club promoted 11 or 12 players from the Under-19s. This season could be our (seniors&rsquo;) last in the MDC, so I&rsquo;m happy to see that the team has a bright future. I believe they will take the cup next season.&rdquo;Arrows&rsquo; next MDC match is against Bidvest Wits at Tsakane Stadium on Sunday (12pm). Fikizolo thinks the match is important: &ldquo;We have lost the championship but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we will take our remaining matches lightly. The boys need to end the season on a high note &ndash; that will encourage them to want more next season. &ldquo;We will be there on Sunday, making sure we guide them and get the three points.&rdquo;
