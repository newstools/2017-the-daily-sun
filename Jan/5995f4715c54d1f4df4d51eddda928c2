NONTSIKAZI Mtshali (38) told Daily Sun her calling was a blessing, but she didn&rsquo;t know it at the time.Celebrating 20 years as a sangoma, Nontsikazi from Zola, Soweto, said it&rsquo;s time she honoured her ancestors for her wonderful gift.&ldquo;I was just a naughty teenager when I received my calling in 1997. No one in my family understood what was happening because we never had a sangoma in the family. My mother was hysterical as I was the youngest of her five children.&rdquo;Nontsikazi said her own daughter was only a year old and it was hard for her mother to let her go because there was no money at home.&ldquo;But I left my baby girl behind to go and thwasa. I told myself that one day my calling would be a great reward to me and my family.&rdquo;During her years of dedication, Nontsikazi was blessed with more than 35 spiritual children and 50 spiritual grandchildren, her amathwasa.&ldquo;I have never worked anywhere but I&rsquo;ve managed to raise three children. My whole life changed. And for that I will forever be grateful.&rdquo;Nontsikazi was praised by her sisters for sticking to her calling.&ldquo;I told her to ignore her calling and join me in the party life, but she never budged,&rdquo; said Nontsikazi&rsquo;s older sister, Sibongile Mkhize.&ldquo;She kept her promise to improve our family and she did. I salute her.&rdquo;
