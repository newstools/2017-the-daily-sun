THOUSANDS of first-year students may not be able to register this year. This is because the National Student Financial Aid Scheme has not released funds to pay for registration fees.Some students told Daily Sun they feared that they would be unable to afford the fees. In previous years, students applied for financial aid through their institutions but from last year, they had to apply directly to the scheme, which has caused a number of problems. Students at the University of Joburg told the SunTeam they were worried because registration was being done on a first come first serve basis, and they might lose their places as a result. The frustrated students said the new system had created a situation that was harmful to their futures. Sipho Zwane said he applied last year before the closing date in September, but he had still not heard whether his application for funding had been successful. Boitumelo Lerloe said that she would be very upset if there were no funds for her to study. &ldquo;I worked hard in matric last year and I was looking forward to studying further. &ldquo;The lack of funding might derail my dream of studying chemical engineering,&rdquo; Boitumelo said. Veli Maluleke said her daughter applied for funding last year and has been accepted to the University of Joburg. &ldquo;They declined her funding application last week and I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to pay the fees because I&rsquo;m unemployed,&rdquo; said Veli. Kagisho Mamabolo, spokesman for the Financial Aid Scheme, told the People&rsquo;s Paper that they would pay for all students whose applications had been successful, and who had successfully registered at institutions of their choice.
