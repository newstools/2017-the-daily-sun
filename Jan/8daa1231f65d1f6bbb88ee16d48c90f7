THE MULTICHOICE Diski Challenge is now going down to the wire and five teams are still in with a chance of being crowned the new champions.Mamelodi Sundowns still lead the standings with 25 points following their 2-1 loss to Maritzburg United last week, a result which revived the hopes of the other teams in the top five. It also put added pressure on Sundowns&rsquo; MDC team, as they are now only four points ahead of fifth placed Highlands Park, who have taken the MDC by storm in their first season.Bloemfontein Celtic, Bidvest Wits, Maritzburg and Highlands are all breathing down Masandawana&rsquo;s necks, waiting for Downs to slip up so they can rise.Sundowns will have to win all four their remaining fixtures if they aim to be crowned 2017 MDC kings.The Young Brazilians will be out to redeem themselves tomorrow when they take on Ajax Cape Town at Tsakane Stadium (12pm). Sundowns coach David Notoane said the result of their last game was a wake-up call. If they don&rsquo;t respond, they will regret it at the end of the season.Last season Notoane&rsquo;s charges lost the title to Golden Arrows on the final day, and they might end up in the same scenario if they don&rsquo;t improve in the four remaining games.Notoane admitted: &ldquo;Our decision-making has not been good in our last three matches.&rdquo;Meanwhile Ajax MDC coach, Vladislav Heric, said they were now playing for a respectable position: &ldquo;Sundowns are never easy opponents but we&rsquo;ll give them a run for their money.&rdquo;
