THREE pupils who wanted to see why they had failed grade 11 last year have been thrown out of school.The pupils are repeating grade 11 at Amandlethu Secondary School at Amaoti in Inanda, eThikwini, KZN. When schools opened they asked their principal for answers, but they were allegedly suspended instead.Because of their ages, three of them are struggling to get placed at new schools. The pupils want the KZN Department of Education to intervene.Their alleged suspension happened on separate occasions over the past few days, with the latest having taken place on Monday. One of the pupils, Nkosikhona Zukulu (20), told Daily Sun he and his fellow complainants were in the history class.&ldquo;There were 66 pupils and we did very well throughout the year. But in December only four pupils passed. When we questioned our teachers in December they refused to answer and referred us to the principal,&rdquo; he claimed. Zukulu claimed they tried to speak to the principal but he became angry.&ldquo;He said he had no obligation to explain to us. He suspended us last week and when we came back this week, he threw us out. All we want is to see how we failed,&rdquo; claimed Nkosikhona.Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KZN MEC for Education, Mthandeni Dlungwana, said the department will send its officials to the school so they can find out the truth.&ldquo;Every pupil, regardless of their grades, has a right to request their marked answer sheets. However, the request should be done with respect. In this case, it looks like the principal will also have his side of the story,&rdquo; he said.
