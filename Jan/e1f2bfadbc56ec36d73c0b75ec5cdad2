THOUSANDS of Eastern Cape kids might find themselves without a school this year. This is after the provincial education department launched an investigation into seven schools suspected of being bogus.Port Elizabeth came under the spotlight when education MEC Mandla Makupula ordered EduPlanet Independent School to be shut down. The MEC discovered that the school was operating from a disused building and was not registered with the department. Six more schools in Nelson Mandela Bay are now also being investigated.Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: &ldquo;We have noticed a number of bogus schools popping up across the province. &ldquo;These illegal private schools are enrolling pupils who are unaware of their status with the department. Parents are also urged to verify if the school where they are enrolling their children is registered.&ldquo;Any operators found to be on the wrong side of the law run the risk of being blacklisted and not being considered for registration or state subsidies.&rdquo;Mtima refused to reveal the names and locations of the six schools. &ldquo;There are still legal issues that need to be dealt with first.&rdquo;
