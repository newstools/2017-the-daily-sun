THEY have been bosom friends for donkeys&rsquo; years and their friendship ended with a fight over donkeys.Now they can&rsquo;t stand one another!The one man is accusing his former friend of being jealous.According to Lentswe Matshete (36), he has been working with his Lesego Tladi (29) and their donkeys to deliver goods in Maboloka, North West.The two grew up together and shared everything, even their secrets.But when Lentswe&rsquo;s four donkeys were attacked by vicious dogs, he decided to go to a sangoma. &ldquo;I was told the dogs were sent by a close friend, the one I worked with.&rdquo; He said that made him angry and he confronted his friend, but his friend denied the allegations.Now Lesego is an angry man. His two donkeys were left bleeding on Christmas Eve and he claims his friend is behind the attack.&ldquo;After he confronted me about sending dogs to attack his donkey, I avoided him and we stopped being friends. On Christmas Eve when I went to check my donkey in the bush, I saw him running. He looked as if someone was chasing him.&rdquo; He said he found his donkeys&rsquo; legs tied and cut at the back, adding that if donkeys&rsquo; spines are targeted, they can be paralysed and become useless. He said he called the SPCA to intervene. &ldquo;I know there is bad blood now and I do not want him to go to jail because he has a family to support. But if he does that again, I won&rsquo;t be accountable for my actions.&rdquo; SPCA inspector Meshack Matlou told the men to take their fight elsewhere and leave the animals alone.&ldquo;If they hurt another donkey, I will personally take them to prison.&rdquo;
