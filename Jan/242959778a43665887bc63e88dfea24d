WHEN the sun sets they keep their fingers crossed, praying that it doesn&rsquo;t rain.Shack dwellers in Clare Estate, near Sydenham, Durban told Daily Sun that rain is the last thing they need at this time as they don&rsquo;t have any shelter.This comes after eThekwini Municipality &shy;allegedly sent private security guards to evict them before demolishing their shacks last Monday.Vusi Khumalo (38) told Daily Sun that most of them have turned big sheets of plastic into sleeping mats as all their belongings were destroyed or confiscated.&ldquo;We sleep on plastic in an open space because we don&rsquo;t have anywhere else to go,&rdquo; said Vusi.Another shack dweller, Khaya Ximba (42), said the security guards took their beds and electrical appliances, which means they will have to buy more all over again.&ldquo;We understand the eviction order, but the manner in which it is done is very painful and inhumane. &ldquo;We are human beings. It would be better if they could get us an alternative place that we could move to in peace.&rdquo; When the SunTeam contacted the municipality on Monday, Princess Nkabane said the enquiry was forwarded to the relevant department and that the communications department was waiting for a response.
