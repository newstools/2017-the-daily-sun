KOKETSO Thobega is a quiet young girl who loves to learn and play with other kids.The 11-year-old from Snake Park in Soweto was taken in by her gogo, Ellen Nsele (58), at the age of three months after her mum dumped her. &ldquo;Koketso has been under my guidance from a very young age and I have raised her as my own,&rdquo; Ellen said.For the longest time gogo Ellen has tried to make sure that Koketso does not feel the absence of her parents. She has worked to see that Koketso fits in with other children at school and in the township. However, she has endured financial strain over the years and she cannot afford to take Koketso back to school this year.With a few days left to the beginning of the new academic year, gogo Ellen is finding it hard to settle her grandkid&rsquo;s 2016 outstanding fees and transport money. The desperate gogo said the first Sassa payment for her grandchild will arrive only in February. &ldquo;It will be too late and I do not know where to go and what to do,&rdquo; she said.The pupil has performed well and has been promoted to grade six. Ellen would appreciate any form of help to take Koketso back to school, be it stationery and uniform donations or direct school fee payments to the primary school. If you would like to help Koketso build her future, please call gogo Ellen on 073 703 8806.
