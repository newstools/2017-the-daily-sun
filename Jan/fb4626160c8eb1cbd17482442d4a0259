GOGO Alvina Silangwe had to live in a shack for almost two years after eThekwini Municipality destroyed her five-roomed house in 2014. Although the municipality had promised to build a four-roomed RDP house to replace it, she was left with only a concrete slab. Finally, the desperate gogo asked Daily Sun to intervene. And now she is the proud owner of a brand new RDP! Daily Sun first published the story about gogo&rsquo;s situation in September last year. At the time, the municipality promised to build her a house in two months. After her house was demolished, Alvina was forced to build three shacks to house herself and seven family members.She had to move her personal belongings to a municipal toilet near her home.The 73-year-old thanked the People&rsquo;s Paper for making sure the municipality kept its promise. &ldquo;I had lost hope that the municipality would ever come back and build the house, but now I&rsquo;m smiling. I don&rsquo;t have to keep my belongings in the toilet anymore and no longer have to live in a shack.&rdquo; When the SunTeam visited her yesterday, gogo couldn&rsquo;t hold back her joy. &ldquo;This paper is miraculous because all my attempts to get help failed. &ldquo;I even contacted Councillor Amon Dladla, who couldn&rsquo;t help me. But this paper brought a smile back to my face.&rdquo; Although the house had not yet been painted, Alvina said she was happy.&ldquo;All I wanted was a decent house.&rdquo; Dladla said he was glad to see the gogo happy and promised the painting would be done soon.
