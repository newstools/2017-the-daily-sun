HAVING guided the Ivory Coast to glory at the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), Herve Renard is now hoping to prevent his former side from successfully defending the trophy when they face his Morocco team tonight (9pm SA time). The script could not have been better written, with Renard s Morocco and the Elephants clashing in a winner-takes-all final Group C showdown in the northern Gabonese town of Oyem. The Atlas Lions have not made it beyond the group stage at the Cup of Nations since reaching the final in 2004 but a 3-1 win against Togo on Friday put them in a position to progress to the last eight at this year s event. A draw would also favour them. DR Congo and Togo meet in the night s other game in Port-Gentil.The Ivorians, though, have no choice but to win if they are to advance after drawing their first two matches. In 2015 we found ourselves in the same situation with two draws and we won 1-0 against Cameroon, recalled Renard of a slow start to his triumphant campaign at the helm of the Ivory Coast in Equatorial Guinea.He left that role to become coach of Lille in his native France, but a disappointing and short-lived experience in Ligue 1 led to a return to the African scene with Morocco.Here he is, hoping to win the trophy for a third time, having also triumphed with Zambia in Gabon in 2012.Now coached by Renard s French compatriot Michel Dussuyer, the Ivorians have drawn with both Togo and DR Congo, but noises coming out of their camp remain optimistic. We are calm. It is those outside the squad who are more worried, insisted Paris Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier. We are here and we are trying to progress from one game to the next. We will do everything to try to qualify. AFP
