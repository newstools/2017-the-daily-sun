According to John&rsquo;s sister Jane (43), they were at home when the two cops arrived with John&rsquo;s baby mama. Jane told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The baby mama said my brother had kidnapped their six-month-old baby. &ldquo;The police called him to the van and made him sign a paper. My neighbours and I watched in disbelief as the police dragged my brother beside their van. After driving for 500 metres they dropped him on the side of the road and drove off. &ldquo;It was horrific. That is a scene that will haunt me for the rest of my life. My brother didn&rsquo;t deserve to die like that.&rdquo;John died on arrival at the local hospital. Jane added that her brother was a hard-working man who transported people&rsquo;s goods using his donkey cart.&ldquo;He made sure that there was food on the table. &ldquo;We are a poor family with no parents. We don&rsquo;t even know how we are going to bury him,&rdquo; she said.
