A MUM of three is living in fear after her dangerous son escaped from the court holding cells last week. Nosisuko Majwede (47) told Daily Sun her son, Thembalethu, stabbed her above the left eye before he was arrested early last month. The 22-year-old was one of 14 prisoners who escaped from Philippi Magistrates Court in Cape Town. &ldquo;I fear for my life because he&rsquo;s really dangerous. If he comes back home while I&rsquo;m sleeping he will definitely kill me. He changed after he came back from the bush in 2011. He would threaten to kill me and told me I&rsquo;m not his mum.&rdquo; Nosisuko said cops came to her house looking for Thembalethu but couldn&rsquo;t find him. When they went to his shack, he was home but he was able to get away.&ldquo;I just wish they could catch him and put him behind bars again.&rdquo; The 14 prisoners escaped when they were about to be transported to Pollsmoor Prison. Nosisuko said when her son appeared in court, he shouted at her. &ldquo;I live in fear. My boy has turned into a scary animal. The day he stabbed me, he also broke the windows of my house.&rdquo;Captain Frederick van Wyk, police spokesman, said nine of the men who escaped had been re-arrested and five were still at large&ldquo;The search for the remaining prisoners continues.&rdquo; He said those who had been arrested again would appear in court this month on charges of escaping from lawful custody.
