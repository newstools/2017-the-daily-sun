WORKERS employed by the Jozi@Work programme have gone on strike. According to the workers, the strike started two weeks ago and affected areas around Soweto most. Workers said they were angry because their contracts were terminated and new people were hired. An employee said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t earn much money but we were able to take care of our families.&rdquo; The worker said they had been working for the programme for 19 months when they were sacked. To show their anger, the strikers threw rubbish around on kasi streets, leaving affected areas stinking. &ldquo;We want them to give us back our jobs. This is nothing compared to what we are prepared to do if no one listens to us,&rdquo; said another worker.Nobuhle Khuzwayo (30), who lives in Protea Glen extension two, said she drove down Ndaba Street every day and there was rubbish all over yesterday morning. &ldquo;This is not right,&rdquo; she said. Zizo Mlaba (42), from Chiawelo, said although there was rubbish all over Chris Hani Road, which he uses every day, he supported the strikers. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t stand up for themselves, nobody will.&rdquo;Virgil James, City of Joburg spokesman, said: &ldquo;They are fully aware that these contracts are temporary for specific work. These work packages must be rotated as long as people apply. The impression should not be given that the city has unfairly terminated binding contracts.&rdquo;
