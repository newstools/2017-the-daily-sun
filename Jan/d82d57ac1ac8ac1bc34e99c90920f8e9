THOMAS can remember 23 women who have run away from him &ndash; because he&rsquo;s a sex machine! He says in Joburg&rsquo;s inner city they call him the sex ghost that doesn&rsquo;t stop.Does Thomas take 20 minutes to complete a round of sex? No. Does he take an hour? No &ndash; Thomas Viyufamboni (40) claims it takes him two hours to complete just one round and women just can&rsquo;t take it.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t drink anything and I don&rsquo;t use any medication. &ldquo;I just keep going for a long time,.&rdquo; And this has angered the women he got intimate with.For years, women have been fleeing from Thomas, the two-hour sex machine. And now he needs help before he dies a lonely man.&ldquo;No woman wants to hang around me &ndash; after just one session,&rdquo; said the sad Thomas.His sexual appetite scares even magoshas away.&ldquo;They run when they see me. &ldquo;Word got around that I poke for two hours non-stop,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what women want. They complain when a man finishes too quickly and they complain when he takes too long.&rdquo;Thomas said he needs help to find a woman who will stand for his two-hour sessions.One of the magoshas who fled said Thomas carries on like a robot. &ldquo;Haibo, I won&rsquo;t take that. &ldquo;He will end up damaging me,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;When I see him, I tell him to go away. I don&rsquo;t want his money. He takes two hours. &ldquo;During that time I could have had four clients.&rdquo;Thomas said he has come to realise that not all women need such a strong man in bed. Asanda Manda (34) from Joburg who knows Thomas said she has not dated any other man like him. &ldquo;After I had sex with him, I told myself I was done. He just can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; she said.
