GOSPEL artist, Lebo Sekgobela (35), believes her music should speak to her before it can speak to listeners.Her song Lion of Judah has been making waves all over Mzansi, and she&rsquo;s surprised by the warm response.&ldquo;It reconnected me to God! It really spoke to me and I wanted it to do the same to everyone. But I never expected to see the manner in which people have received it. It&rsquo;s by God&rsquo;s grace and I&rsquo;m so grateful,&rdquo; said the vocalist, songwriter and producer.Lion of Judah is a track from Lebo&rsquo;s third album Restored, which she describes as uncompromising worship, contemporary praise and a revival of old and original hymns.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with hymns because the messages in them are still relevant to the way we should live life,&rdquo; said Lebo, who is also a devoted wife and mum of three.The album was recorded live at Hope Restoration Ministries in Kempton park, Ekurhuleni, and recently won her a Crown Gospel Award for Best Gospel Female Artist.Born in Sebokeng in the Vaal, Lebo has always been rooted in music.&ldquo;Like most singers, I started singing in church and school. I would always get involved in choirs and anything musical,&rdquo; said the husky-voiced singer.She added that her voice is a gift &ndash; which enables her to touch people&rsquo;s hearts through music and the message in the music.Lebo has shared stages with Benjamin Dube, Solly Mahlangu, William Sejake, Vicky Vilakazi and Neyi Zimu.Speaking to SunBuzz, she stressed her humble beginnings in the music industry and throughout life.&ldquo;I believe in starting from the bottom, to really come full circle in whatever situation I find myself in.&ldquo;I started out as a backing vocalist, but I didn&rsquo;t want to rush to become a main solo act.&ldquo;I hope young people always keep this in mind &ndash; in whatever they choose to do.&rdquo; ) Restored is available on iTunes and in music stores.
