IT USED to be a jikeleza with only two doors, but passengers didn&rsquo;t like it as they&rsquo;d all have to get in and out as soon as a stop arrived.But instead of dumping his wheels, owner and mechanic Mzoxolo &ldquo;Sirha&rdquo; Zenani made another plan.And now his roofless five-in-one kasi convertible is the talk of the town!Sirha (33) of KwaNobuhle in Uitenhage told Daily Sun that before, passengers complained and even laughed at his car when it was still just a three-in-one but now people demand to be seen in it. The car used to be an Opel Kadett, but then Sirha took to it with an angle grinder and removed the roof.And where before it had the back of a VW Polo, the sides and engine of an Opel Kadett and the grille of an Audi, it has now inherited the parts of two more cars.Sirha&rsquo;s convertible now has a powerful BMW 325i engine which makes it roar like a lion, and the sexy look is rounded off with VW Golf 5 GTI rims.&ldquo;Whenever I pass with my car, ladies and gents scream. They also ask me to give them a lift.&ldquo;I tell them I no longer use it as a jikeleza. But they insist I take them to town and funerals,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be a jikeleza again because I have upgraded it.&rdquo; He said even traffic cops found it hard to give him a traffic fine.&ldquo;In 2015 I jumped a red light and a traffic officer stopped me. But he was so confused and didn&rsquo;t know what to write on the ticket and he ended up writing Audi Polo!&rdquo;One of his passengers, Nozipho Mkobeni (32), said: &ldquo;This guy is so talented. &ldquo;When I ride with him I feel like a queen. I have never seen a car like this before. This is our car for VIP treatment.&rdquo;
