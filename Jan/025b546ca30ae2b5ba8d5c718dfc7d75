A GROUP of heavily armed men robbed a butchery on Monday, leaving several people wounded. Eight thugs ambushed the manager of OBC Meat and Chicken Butchery in Soshanguve Plaza, Tshwane at about 9am. Three street vendors were left wounded and had to be rushed to Dr George Mukhari Hospital after a shoot-out between the thugs and the SAPS flying squad. Police Captain Stephen Maluleka said while some members of the gang were robbing the butchery, others went to put explosives in a nearby ATM. They saw the cops and started shooting at them with pistols and rifles. The police were forced to return fire. Customers at surrounding shops abandoned their trollies and went running for their lives after the first gunshots rang out. A 40-year-old woman said it was the scariest moment of her life. &ldquo;I threw myself on to the floor of a shop, thinking I wouldn&rsquo;t make it.&rdquo; Taxi driver Abraham Malatjie said: &ldquo;I was talking to my colleagues when suddenly we heard gunshots and people screaming.&rdquo; The police bomb squad had to be called to the scene to remove the explosives from the ATM. Maluleka said the thugs in the butchery ordered customers and guards to lie down. They fled with money in a white Mercedes-Benz and a white VW Polo. The injured people, two men and a woman, are in a stable condition in hospital.
