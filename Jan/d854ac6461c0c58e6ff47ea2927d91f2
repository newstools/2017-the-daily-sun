AN ARTICLE in yesterday&rsquo;s Sunday Times speculates that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe could be heading for Parliament and he may be the next finance minister, replacing Pravin Gordhan.The article also said President Jacob Zuma is under pressure to fire Gordhan.Molefe&rsquo;s name was sent to Luthuli House by the North West province to be added to the list of its members it wants to be MPs.For the past few weeks, rumours have been flying that a cabinet reshuffle will happen soon.Zuma&rsquo;s backers said they want African Union chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next president of the country after Zuma&rsquo;s departure. If all goes according to the North West plan, the man they call the &ldquo;son of their province who has excellently executed his mandate at Eskom&rdquo; could be sworn in sooner rather than later.The paper said the reshuffle could happen soon after the State of the Nation Address on 9 February. Molefe resigned as CEO after the then Public Protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s State of Capture report late last year. Molefe was credited with bringing stability to the power utility during his tenure and putting a stop to load-shedding in the country. At a New Age breakfast last year he called on South Africans to focus on defeating what he called &ldquo;the demon of racism and exploitation and to sort out this white dominated economy.&rdquo;
