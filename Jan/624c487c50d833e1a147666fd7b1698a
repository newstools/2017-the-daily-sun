MOST people are enjoying the first week of 2017. But not Phakama Khabazela (25), who began the year with death threats at Nsimbini, south of Durban. The threats keep coming, triggered by tensions growing out of a land use issue. Phakama told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Since Saturday, residents from my neighbourhood have come to shout insults and death threats at me. They accuse me of delaying the upgrade of the Cwaka gravel road which passes just below my house. &ldquo;They say they&rsquo;re going to kill me,&rdquo; she sobbed. Her misery began on Saturday when a large portion of her wall was broken down, allegedly by a group of angry residents who stormed her home when she wasn&rsquo;t there.&ldquo;I reported it to the cops and they said the matter should be dealt with by the local traditional leadership. I also reported to the induna, but I still don&rsquo;t have peace of mind. My safety is threatened.&rdquo;She said the road upgrade started last year. Project managers told her that part of her fence would have to be demolished to allow for the road.&ldquo;The manager said they would follow proper procedures when they open this month, as they were closing for the holidays in December. I had no problem. No resident ever came to discuss the wall issue with me.&rdquo; Induna Derrick Hlongwa said he will report the matter to the inkosi towards the end of this week.&ldquo;I have calmed the residents down. It was very wrong of them to demolish somebody&rsquo;s property without her consent. &ldquo;In villages led by amakhosi, such matters are discussed and the property owner&rsquo;s consent is respectfully sought.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN police spokesman, said Phakama should take the matter to the Folweni Police Station manager if she intends to pursue a case of property destruction and intimidation.
