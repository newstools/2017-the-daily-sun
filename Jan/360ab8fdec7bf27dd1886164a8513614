THE year started badly for these 15 shack owners.Their homes burned down on Saturday night. The incident, which happened at Zandspruit squatter camp, Joburg was made worse when angry residents threw stones at the fire engine when it arrived. Robert Mulaudzi, spokesman for City of Joburg Emergency Management Services, said: &ldquo;We discourage members of the community from harassing officials when they&rsquo;re on duty. Officials were treating patients for smoke inhalation when they saw stones flying. &ldquo;The residents alleged the fire engine had arrived late, but that wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo; In a separate incident on Saturday, more than 12 shacks caught fire in George Goch, Joburg, leaving their owners and their families homeless. The fire was allegedly started by a paraffin stove. Mulaudzi said no one was injured in both incidents.
