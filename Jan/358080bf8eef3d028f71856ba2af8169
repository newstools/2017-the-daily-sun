LINDIWE Mavundla was devastated when Home Affairs told her the child she had carried for nine months and raised for 17 years was not hers. The 50-year-old from Inanda, north of Durban told Daily Sun that Umgeni Home Affairs told her she needed to prove she was the biological mother of her 17-year-old daughter. Lindiwe said her problems started when she went to change the surname on her daughter&rsquo;s birth certificate in February.&ldquo;I got married in 2015 and my husband and I decided to change my daughter&rsquo;s surname because she was using my maiden name,&rdquo; said the mum. She said after applying for the change of surname, she was told to wait for six months. &ldquo;After waiting for six months, I received a call from an official telling me I should collect the certificate.&ldquo;When I got there, I was told my daughter qualified to apply for an ID,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We applied for the ID and were told to wait three months.&ldquo;After hearing nothing about the matter for more than three months, I called Home Affairs.&ldquo;I was shocked when they said my own flesh and blood was not my daughter.&rdquo;Lindiwe said when she went back to Home Affairs to find out what was going on, she was told to bring proof that she was her daughter&rsquo;s biological mum. &ldquo;This is frustrating because my daughter is in matric this year. &ldquo;We need her ID so she can write her exams.&rdquo; She said she wanted the matter investigated because she had no idea how this had happened. Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola requested Lindiwe&rsquo;s&nbsp;details and those of her daughter to investigate further.
