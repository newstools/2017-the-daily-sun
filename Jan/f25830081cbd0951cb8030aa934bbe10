IT&rsquo;S all systems go as close to 12 million pupils across Mzansi head back to the classroom today.But some will be enjoying a few extra days of sitting at home, as they have no schools to go to!In Gauteng, 58 000 pupils including 45 000 grade 1s and grade 8s will stay home while they wait to be placed.These children are casualties of the new online registration system which was introduced in Gauteng last year.The system, which was initiated by Gauteng Education, has seen a number of children rejected by schools their parents applied to.Frustrated parents said they had no idea what was going to happen to their children.Parent Joyce Dladla said the department should go back to the manual application system. &ldquo;This has caused so much confusion for so many parents. I took time off work to register and then the system was offline. So I had to take another day off and do it all over again,&rdquo; said Joyce.Department spokesman Oupa Bodibe said that they will not scrap the online system.&ldquo;We are not going back to the manual system,&rdquo; he said.Eastern Cape also had its fair share of problems. Parents are worried whether their children will be getting any education at all as the province has a shortage of teachers.&ldquo;Schools in northern areas are ready for reopening, but we are still facing a severe teacher shortage as well as overcrowding.&ldquo;We want the department to attend to this,&rdquo; said one parent. In Western Cape, more than one million pupils are expected to arrive at schools today.Western Cape education department officials have been hard at work to ensure a smooth start to the academic year. &ldquo;Most of the preparations were completed well before the end of last year,&rdquo; said education MEC Debbie Schafer.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga and Free State education MEC Tate Makgoe will visit Phehellang Secondary School in Parys today as part of the department&rsquo;s school readiness programme.
