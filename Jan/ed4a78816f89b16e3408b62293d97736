FOR madala Mzuzwana Mlamli, his morning ritual is not complete until he gets his hands on a copy of Daily Sun!The 61-year-old walks nearly 5km every morning to his favourite shop where he has a copy waiting for him, because he is a loyal customer.His RDP house is so full of copies of the People&rsquo;s Paper that he has to throw some away, which he said breaks his heart.The madala from Libode, near Mthatha said he had not missed an issue for the past five years.&ldquo;I first discovered Sunday Sun and then one day I saw Daily Sun. I found that it also covers horse-racing quite well, which I bet on every day,&rdquo; said the madala.The experienced betting man said with the money he has won over the years, he managed to furnish the house that he shares with his wife Sylvia (49), son Happy (28) and two other younger kids still in high school.&ldquo;A man who enjoys betting the way I do can get carried away but my wife keeps me in check. I have won more than R10 000 a number of times over the years, and I don&rsquo;t spend less than R100 on my bets.&rdquo; Sylvia said she watched him like a hawk as she believed R100 could be better spent.&ldquo;We cannot eat horses, I keep telling him.&rdquo; She added that the whole family enjoyed reading the People&rsquo;s Paper because it used simple English they could understand.Madala Mlamli said he suffered a stroke when he was just five years old, which left one side of his body numb.He regained the use of his body although his left arm and fingers were left bent out of shape.But it has never stopped him in life. &ldquo;I appreciate reading the positive stories in Daily Sun about people who rise above their challenges to become the best that they can be. &ldquo;Keep it up, Daily Sun!&rdquo; said the contented madala.
