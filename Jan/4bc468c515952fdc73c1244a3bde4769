A DIEPSLOOT woman accused of abusing an eight-month-old baby at her creche has been rearrested. The 68-year-old woman had thought she was off the hook following her release from prison last week. Last Wednesday her case was thrown out of the Randburg Magistrates Court, with the court giving lack of evidence as the reason.On Tuesday the court reversed its decision, saying the video footage of the woman feeding the child contains enough evidence. The court then granted a warrant for her to be arrested again.The video shows the woman feeding the baby at her creche and then physically assaulting the little boy.Gauteng police have since closed the creche. The furious family of the child and the community want the gogo removed from the area. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said the investigating officer has obtained statements from the mother of the boy and some witnesses.Abram Kgari from the Diepsloot Early Childhood Development Forum said the baby&rsquo;s mother was seen leaving the creche in tears last week and hasn&rsquo;t been spotted since.However, yesterday the police confirmed they had managed to trace the mother and took a statement from her.
