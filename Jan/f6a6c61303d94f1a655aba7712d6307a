REAL Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane rounded on his team&rsquo;s detractors yesterday ahead of the second leg of the King&rsquo;s Cup quarterfinal at Celta Vigo, saying their recent blip in form has been exaggerated.Real set a Spanish record of 40 games unbeaten in all competitions earlier in January and remain top of the La Liga standings by a point with a game in hand on title rivals Barcelona and Sevilla.A first league defeat of the season by Sevilla and a 2-1 loss to Celta Vigo in the Cup removed the team&rsquo;s veneer of invincibility, however, and Saturday&rsquo;s unconvincing 2-1 win over Malaga did little to stem the criticism. Real&rsquo;s supporters even booed their players during the game.&ldquo;Listening to some of these questions you&rsquo;d think we were battling relegation,&rdquo; Zidane told reporters ahead of today&rsquo;s trip to Celta Vigo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried and neither are the players.&rdquo; &ndash; REUTERS
