KGOLOKO Thobejane has been sacked as Baroka FC head coach!The outspoken Baroka coach has been replaced by well-travelled Jacob Sakala and will work under him as his assistant in new developments confirmed by club CEO Morgan Mammila yesterday.And the former school teacher hadn&rsquo;t taken the news of his sudden sacking well.Speaking to SunSport yesterday, Thobejane was still in denial about the developments: &ldquo;I was with Mammila at training this morning but he didn&rsquo;t tell me anything and there was no new coach. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t say much, they are the ones who make decisions. Anything they do is for the benefit of the club. I don&rsquo;t know what is next for me.&rdquo;He claims to know nothing about his demotion, saying he read about it in the media. Mammila said: &ldquo;With Sakala in charge of the club in the second round we expect to finish in the top eight bracket. His mandate is to make sure the team does not get relegated at the end of the season.&rdquo;Sakala is expected to start working with Khurishi Mphahlele&rsquo;s team today, with his first official PSL match against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on 8 February. Thobejane won promotion from the National First Division with the club and has promised to win the title in his first season the PSL, something which has turned out to be only a pipe dream. Under Thobejane the club recorded only two victories in 15 PSL matches, results that have left them languishing at the bottom of the standings with 12 points.
