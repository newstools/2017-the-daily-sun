RESIDENTS of Utrecht, in northern KZN, want the local mine to hire them or move out of their area.The people claim that Uitkomst Coal Mine, which started operating in 2009, only hires outsiders.Ntokozo Mnguni is the secretary of Eyethu, a local community-based organisation. He said they handed a memorandum of grievances to the mine&rsquo;s management on Monday. &ldquo;We will close all roads leading to the mine until we get answers. &ldquo;We have been silent for too long. We wrote letters in July and December last year asking them to employ locals, but they never responded. Now we are demanding action and answers from management.&rdquo; He accused the mine of not contributing towards the development of the area. &ldquo;Unemployment here is very high while the mine is full of outsiders.&rdquo; Resident Bonga Hadebe (34) said at least 50% of the mine&rsquo;s workforce should consist of local residents.General manager Johan Gloy said the mine is a major employer in Utrecht. &ldquo;Our policy is to employ local residents and get skilled people from outside if we can&rsquo;t source them locally,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The mine has set aside R15 million for projects such as electrification of the area over the next five years.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;According to the Utrecht cops, about 350 residents embarked on a peaceful march to the local mine to complain about the lack of job opportunities.&rdquo;
