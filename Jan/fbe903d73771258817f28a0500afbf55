THEY were sitting under a tree, drinking, talking and minding their own business. But suddenly beer bottles were scattered all over the place when suddenly a swarm of angry bees attacked!Four residents from J section KwaMashu, north of Durban are nursing wounds after they were ambushed and stung by the bees on Tuesday.Witness Ntokozo Zulu (39) told Daily Sun she ran outside when she heard people screaming. &ldquo;I saw them running and screaming,&rdquo; said Ntokozo. &ldquo;The bees came from a nearby stream which is dirty and smelly as no one cleans it. This was the first time we saw them. We are now afraid they may attack again,&rdquo; she said.The four injured residents were rushed to a nearby clinic. We suspect that someone disturbed the bees in their hive and they got angry. Mahlengi Manqele (33), who was stung, spent the night at the clinic.&ldquo;This was the worst pain I have ever felt. I thought I was going to die. &ldquo;But I got an injection at the clinic and the pain got better,&rdquo; she said.Tuh Shandu (40) said they were drinking under the tree when the bees attacked them.&ldquo;They stung me on my hand and it became swollen. We left the beer bottles there and ran for our lives,&rdquo; said Tuh.Bees will seldom attack unless their territory is threatened. Bees are important and should be protected as much as possible.
