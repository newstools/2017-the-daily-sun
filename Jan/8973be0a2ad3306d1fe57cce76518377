THE community of Khuma, near Stilfontein in the North West, is shocked by the death of an eight-year-old boy. The boy was allegedly electrocuted by an electric fence after a cable was left exposed. According to his family, this happened after an Eskom electrician had done work there. The incident happened on Sunday afternoon. The victim was Karlos Kadoro, a grade 2 pupil at Nozizwe Primary School. Residents believe he would still be alive had Eskom taken action, because people allegedly reported the hanging cables. His father, Joe Kadoro, said: &ldquo;I was opening a window and got shocked when it touched the washline attached to the fence. I immediately went out to check the cable tied to a pole. That is when I saw my son lying on top of the fence near a tap in the neighbour&rsquo;s yard.&ldquo;I took a broomstick to pull him off the fence and immediately rushed him to the clinic, but he was certified dead.&rdquo;Councillor Mpapa Qankase said Eskom must take full responsibility for the incident. Loyiso Jiya, Eskom provincial spokesman, said: &ldquo;The officials attended the scene on Sunday and found that a cable was stolen. They found a piece hanging which was in contact with the fence. The customer did not report that the cables were stolen. Therefore we were not aware of this cable.&rdquo; Jiya promised to investigate and contact the family. North West police said an inquest docket has been opened.
