GROWING in up in a poor family didn&rsquo;t lead Sandile Mbili into crime. Instead, it opened his mind and gave him ideas about what he could do to survive.After the death of his parents in 2015, he had no one to support him and his three young siblings.&ldquo;So I had to think fast, as the older child. There was no way I could let my brother and two sisters starve.&rdquo;Strong Sandile from Ezimbokodweni, near Folweni in the south of Durban, dropped out of school last year when he was still in grade 10 and started his chicken dust business. He operates from Isipingo taxi rank.&ldquo;My 19-year-old brother who finished his matric in 2015 got a job at a company near Isipingo in December last year and he also supports the family.&rdquo;He said his day starts at 5am and ends at about 6pm. He said working from the taxi rank gives him an advantage because it is where many people are found.Sandile plans to open a butchery one day.&ldquo;I want to set an example to other young people who think crime is a way out of poverty. When I have saved enough money, I will go back to school.&rdquo;
