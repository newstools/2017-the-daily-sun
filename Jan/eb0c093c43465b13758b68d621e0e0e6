DESPITE being arrested for invading land in Lebowakgomo, EFF members are still at it!The invaders have vowed not to stop despite being shot at with rubber bullets and their leaders being indicted by sheriffs of the court. Last week, residents apparently invaded open bushy land next to Lebowakgomo Hospital in Chuenespoort, Limpopo. They claim the land has become a haven for criminals who use it as a hiding place. EFF Councillor Ruphus Mphahlele at Lepelle-Nkumpi local municipality, who is leading the invasion, said: &ldquo;Our people have no land and now we are told this bushy area which has become a hiding place for criminals is in the municipality&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;We only hear this now when we have allocated stands to people in need. All along nothing was said about this land. &ldquo;We are going to continue to give our people land, despite them sending police to beat or arrest us.&rdquo; Mphahlele said he was beaten when he raised the land issue during a municipal executive council meeting. He claimed there had been a caucus before the meeting by other councillors to beat EFF members if they imposed the land issue at the meeting. &ldquo;I could have fought but because I heard about their plans to beat us up if weimposed the land issue I just let them continue with their plan after I questioned the land issue. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop talking about land while our people are overcrowded in matchbox houses in Lebowakgomo. &ldquo;We allocate land to anyone from Lepelle-Nkumpi who wants it as long as they have material to immediately build their shacks,&rdquo; said Mphahlele.Municipal spokesman for Lepelle-Nkumpi, Khali Maphoso, said the EFF members who invaded the land were summonsed. &ldquo;They left but returned during the holidays. They took advantage of the fact that the sheriffs are on leave. We are going to continue with the process this week and stop them from grabbing municipal land,&rdquo; said Maphoso.
