MADALA George Senope is furious! He woke up on Friday morning to find that someone had painted a &ldquo;final warning&rdquo; on his shack in red paint.The 63-year-old from Snake Park squatter camp in Soweto told Daily Sun he wanted whoever was responsible to stop being a coward and speak to him face to face. &ldquo;If someone has something to say they shouldn&rsquo;t paint things on my wall while I&rsquo;m asleep. &ldquo;They should come and face me.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that people say I&rsquo;m a witch and want me out of the picture. Someone even told me I could end up dead if I don&rsquo;t take the threats seriously. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t leave this place. I&rsquo;ve been living here for the past 20 years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve applied for an RDP and I want the government to know where I am.&rdquo; He said he suspected he was being accused of witchcraft because he was old and ugly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unemployed and I recycle for money. &ldquo;People might have seen the materials in my yard and decided I was a witch. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m no witch.&rdquo;The SunTeam spoke to residents who said they were aware of the rumours but didn&rsquo;t believe the madala was capable of evil. Cynthia Masondo (56) said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been living here for many years with the madala. We&rsquo;ve never seen or suspected him of anything. &ldquo;Why would he start now?&rdquo; Bhamuza Zulu (58) said: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything about the witchcraft allegations but no one can threaten someone without proof.&rdquo; Captain Kay Makhubela said the madala should visit his nearest police station and open a case as soon as possible.
