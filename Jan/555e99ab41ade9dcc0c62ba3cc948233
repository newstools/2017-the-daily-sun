Former Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas has challenged Kaizer Chiefs striker Michelle Katsvairo to step up his game to justify his reputation as a prolific forward.Katsvairo, who is now with National First Division side AmaZulu, believes that once Katsvairo has fully settled at Amakhosi he will be a force to be reckoned with."Having worked with Michelle at Chicken Inn, and knowing his ability as a fearless striker with an eye for goal, I have no doubt that once he has fully found his feet at Chiefs he is bound to be their reliable striker," Antipas told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."Look, there is no doubt about his ability as a striker, but obviously being a foreign player at a big team like Chiefs comes with high expectations and pressure."So, Michelle has to pull up his socks up and prove his worth by creating and scoring more goals, because he has constantly been getting game-time," added Antipas.A product of Zimbabwe's famous Aces Academy, which has already fed the PSL with Knowledge Musona and Khama Billiat, the 26-year-old striker has scored twice in 11 starts and 3 substitute appearances in all competitions.Having finished the Premiership's first round on a high note, Amakhosi will resume league duty by hosting Free State Stars at FNB Stadium on 7 February.
