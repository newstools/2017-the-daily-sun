History was made at the 74th Golden Globes Awards, which took place at Beverly Hilton Hotel in the United States of America on Sunday. Tracee Ellis Ross was the talk of the town after she won the Best Actress in a Television Series Comedy or Musical award for her role on Black-ish. The last time a black actress won in the same category was in 1983, when Debbie Allen took the award for her role in Fame. Ellis Ross was up against Rachel Bloom for her role in Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Julia Louis-Dreyfus for Vee, Sarah Jessica Parker for Divorce, Issa Rae for Insecure and Gina Rodriguez for Jane the Virgin. Actress Viola Davis has been doing exceptionally well over the years. She was honoured with a Hollywood star at the beginning of the year. On Sunday Davis won the Best Supporting Actress award for her role on Fences, a movie about a working-class African-American father&rsquo;s struggle to raise his family in the 1950s. It was directed by Denzel Washington, who also stars in the film. Davis said: &ldquo;I would like to thank Braun Pictures, Macro, Paramount, Scott Rudin, Todd Black, Molly Allen and all the people who believed in this film. It&rsquo;s not common for Hollywood to translate a play into a movie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d also like to thank my husband and daughter, as well as my father Dan Davis. My father was born in 1936, groomed horses, had a fifth-grade education and didn&rsquo;t know how to read until he was 15. But he had a story, and it deserved to be told.&rdquo; Other winners include Donald Glover, who won the Best Actor in a Television Series Comedy or Musical for his television series titled Atlanta.
