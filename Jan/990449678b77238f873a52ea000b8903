LEGENDARY singer Thandi Klaasen&rsquo;s memorial service was held yesterday at the Germiston City Hall in Ekurhuleni. Reverend Luxolo Mantini said he was inspired by the modest life Mam Thandi chose for herself. &ldquo;A good name is more desirable than great riches. She chose to live a modest life. A better person chooses a good thing above all else,&rdquo; said Mantini.Well-known celebrities like Afrosoul singer Ringo Madlingozi, Metro FM presenter Nothemba Madumo, actress Nambitha Mpumlwana, Blondie Makhene, Tony Kholofelo and Babsy Mlangeni attended the memorial to pay their respects to the late Sophiatown legend. Mam Thandi&rsquo;s two children, Lorraine Klaasen and Roger Phambane paid tribute to their mum in song. Roger said he was not as close to his mum as his younger sister Lorraine. &ldquo;But I knew I had a special place in my mum&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Roger. Lorraine said she had a great relationship with her mum because they were baptised by fire. She said: &ldquo;We had a lot in common, both as singers and of course we were both girls. I inherited the gift of singing from her. &ldquo;I know she loved me so much because she would say it all the time and at times even sing it in a song.&rdquo; Lorraine sang I love You, the song her mum always sang for her. Before leaving the stage she told the crowd that she was wearing her mum&rsquo;s favourite hat and shoes. Mam Thandi&rsquo;s grandchildren and great-grandchildren also paid tribute to her and spoke about how she was the comedian of the family. Legendary musician Bra Hugh Masekela was notably absent. A tribute jazz session will be held today at the Market Theatre in Newtown from 12&ndash;5pm. Mam Thandi will be laid to rest tomorrow. Her funeral service will be held at the DJ Thomas Hall in Eden Park, Alberton. The service will start at 8am and the procession will leave for the Heroes Acre at Thomas Nkobi Memorial Park, formerly known as South Park Cemetery, in Boksburg at 11.30am.
