Memphis Depay has said that there is no bad blood between him and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho.&nbsp;Depay, who has left United to join Lyon, played just 20 minutes in the Premier League this season after faling out of favour with Mourinho.&nbsp;Despite this, Depay has insisted that he harbours no ill feeling towards the Portuguese tactician.&nbsp;"His words were nice. In Manchester, I always worked as I had to,&rdquo; Depay told&nbsp;OL TV. &ldquo;For me personally, it wasn't all that easy, I needed to play. But we didn't have a bad relationship."He's a great coach and a great person. Now we'll see here how I play. In any case, I think he has said good things about me."The 22-year-old came off the bench to make his debut for Lyon in their 3-1 win over Marseille last weekend, but Depay is now looking to break into the starting line-up.&nbsp;"I feel very good, in top form. My first week was good, training went very well, and little by little I'm getting back into the rhythm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now I think I'm ready to start a game as of the next match. I'm training hard, my fitness is good. I think I can push for a starting place for the next game."
