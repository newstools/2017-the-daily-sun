S TEVEN PIENAAR and Keagan Dolly&rsquo;s stories have the same reverberations. They&rsquo;re both from Westbury in Joburg and had to travel 1 400km to Ajax Cape Town to make an impact in the Premier Soccer League (PSL). Pienaar is a product of the School of Excellence, but Joburg clubs were fast asleep when Ajax pounced and got his signature.He later traumatised the so-called glamour clubs, most notably Orlando Pirates in the Rothmans Cup, with his dribbling skills. He then moved abroad to the Netherlands.Dolly&rsquo;s tale also has a similar twist.He was groomed at the School of Excellence and later ALS Puk Tawana (a Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; development project) before he was loaned out to the Urban Warriors in Cape Town.Now he is on the brink of realising his dream of playing abroad in one of the biggest leagues in the world.The community of Westbury must be proud of their sons.Dolly and Pienaar are offering hope and inspiration to a township that&rsquo;s infested with drugs, alcohol abuse, gangsterism and petty crime.Kids in the township will now have proper role models to look up to, instead of the past when ganja-smoking, gun-toting hotheads were heros.Both are active in community upliftment projects in Westbury.Whenever he&rsquo;s back, Pienaar is always conspicuous by his presence at the Under-11, Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 tournaments that he organises at the Westbury Oval and the Union Stadium.You should see the tiny tots&rsquo; eyes when they take selfies with the Everton and Bafana Bafana legend, there&rsquo;s beams of hope and desire.They want to be like him when they grow up.Dolly too, does so much for the community and the kids in his kasi.He&rsquo;s seen as an idol and someone who is approachable, and always there to give advice.Dolly is hungry . . . and that will make him a success and enable him to survive hardships in Europe.Many promising and talented Mzansi stars have gone to Europe, only to come back without cracking it.Tefu Mashamaite, Tsepo Masilela, Siyanda Xulu, Bernard Parker, Siboniso Gaxa, Darren Keet, Granwald Scott, Nathan Paulse and Katlego &ldquo;Killer&rdquo; Mphela left South Africa with so much promise &ndash; only to come back to the comfort of home and the PSL.Only Benni McCarthy, Pienaar, Quinton Fortune, Lucas Radebe have left an indelible mark in the European leagues.We don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for the likes of Andile Jali, Mandla Masango, Kermit Erasmus, May Mahlangu, Dino Ndlovu, Tokelo Rantie, who have been abroad for some time but are not have attracted the attention of bigger European clubs.I have this lekker feeling that Dolly is going to make us proud. His demeanour and attitude speak of a man who will fly South Africa&rsquo;s flag very high.The French league has been a gateway for many African stars to impress.I can&rsquo;t wait to see him dazzling France with his skills.You go boy!
