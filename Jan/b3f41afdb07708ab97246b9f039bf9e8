WHEN his best friends called him to give them a lift, David Ngorima (38) thought it was the right thing to do.But it was a decision he would soon regret.Soon he found himself lying drugged at his friend&rsquo;s house.His car was gone and some of his personal belongings, and so were the beautiful women he had taken to the house.According to David, he left his warm bed in Bramley, near Alexandra, north of Joburg in the early hours of Saturday morning and drove his white 2013 Toyota Corolla to pick up his three male friends at a pub in Balfour Park. &ldquo;I was only trying to help them. They were desperate for transport and there were no taxis.&ldquo;But now I have lost my car and belongings. I need my car. It is a source of income because I use it to transport people.&rdquo;David said he fetched his friends at the pub and took them home. &ldquo;They all had a woman they&rsquo;d met at the pub. My friends insisted I should go into the house with them. I couldn&rsquo;t disappoint them. My friends then opened a bottle of wine and I also drank a glass. While we were sitting around I suddenly felt drowsy. I told my friends I had to go home but I don&rsquo;t remember what happened next.&rdquo; David said he woke up two hours later to find his car keys gone. &ldquo;I went outside to check my car but it was also gone. My friends had also passed out. We had all been drugged by the women.&rdquo;Bramley police spokesman Captain Molefe Mogodi confirmed police are investigating a case of theft of a motor vehicle. David is offering a R5 000 reward to anyone who can help him find his car and the women.
