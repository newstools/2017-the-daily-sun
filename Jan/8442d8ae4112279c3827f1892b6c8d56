WHEN the spaza owner told the armed men she had no money, they shot her &ndash; and wounded the six-month-old baby in her arms.&nbsp; One of the thugs grabbed the infant and carried on shooting!&nbsp; &ldquo;I was there to buy chips,&rdquo; said a witness.&nbsp; &ldquo;They shot the woman and the baby in her arms. Then the thug took the baby and gave it to a customer before continuing to shoot the mother in her head.&rdquo;&nbsp; Residents of Sweet Homes, in Philippi, Cape Town said they were shocked because the woman (29) was very kind. She had allegedly been a mashonisa, but she stopped lending money last year.&nbsp; The witness said: &ldquo;These thugs have no mercy. They shot an innocent baby. . . Why?&rdquo;&nbsp; Madala Mxolisi Ntshangasi (72) said they want to help the cops, but suspects get arrested and two days later they are back on the streets.&nbsp; Nokuzola Bhityi (35) said they need a neighbourhood watch to patrol their community.&nbsp; Cops confirmed that cases of murder and attempted murder are being investigated.&nbsp; Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said suspects had not been arrested.
