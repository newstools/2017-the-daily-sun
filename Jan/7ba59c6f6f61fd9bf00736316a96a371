COPS and community members worked together on Sunday to bust two men suspected of terrorising residents. The Ekurhuleni East crime prevention unit and the people of Tsakane and KwaThema bust two suspects, aged 34 and 47, on Sunday. The cops had been searching for the suspects for some time as they have been linked to a number of house robberies, armed robberies and business robberies in the area. They were finally bust after police received a tip-off early on Sunday morning. When the police arrived at the suspects&rsquo; house in Springs, both of them tried to flee in a white VW Golf but the cops gave chase. They were finally caught after backup was called. The cops recovered a 9mm pistol and six rounds of ammunition. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said: &ldquo;They will appear in court soon to face charges of house robbery, business robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm.&rdquo;
