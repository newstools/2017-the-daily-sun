RESIDENTS were hoping the new mayor would bring change, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like happening. Abaqulusi mayor Martin Mtshali, elected in August, is sitting at home after the IFP reportedly suspended him on Friday.This follows a KZN Education Department investigation that found he was involved in fraud of about R400 000 allegedly committed before 2012, while he was principal of Lindumthetho Primary School.Resident Thanduxolo Sibalukhulu (53) from Vryheid said he hoped Mtshali would solve the water problems in the area.&ldquo;How is the municipality going to provide us with services when it&rsquo;s without a mayor? We are still struggling without water,&rdquo; said Thanduxolo.IFP chairman Blessed Gwala confirmed Mtshali has been suspended, but Mtshali denied it. &ldquo;It is a lie that I am suspended. I asked the council on Thursday to allow me to take sick leave while I&rsquo;m dealing with the department of education.&rdquo;He said the department has already found him guilty and has called him to a disciplinary hearing, but he is challenging the finding and said he has not been told the date of the hearing.&ldquo;The department never gave me a chance to respond to the allegations. My lawyers sent a letter to the department on Friday, appealing the outcome of the so-called investigation,&rdquo; said Mtshali.KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said they are not willing to involve the media and public in the matter.He didn&rsquo;t confirm or deny that the department had received the letter from Mtshali&rsquo;s lawyers.Abaqulusi municipal spokesman Arnold Ramodibe said the council has not taken a decision on the Mtshali matter.&ldquo;The IFP has suspended the mayor but the municipal council is still discussing the matter,&rdquo; said Ramodibe.Gwala said: &ldquo;We decided as a party to suspend him, because we can&rsquo;t let someone who is accused of serious cases carry on with his duties as if nothing happened.&ldquo;We wanted to set an example that our party does not tolerate any misconduct.&rdquo;
