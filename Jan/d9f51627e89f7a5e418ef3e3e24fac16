RIYAD Mahrez chose to play for Algeria rather than France, where he was born, in a tribute to his late father, the African player of the year&rsquo;s brother said.Propelled to global renown by Leicester City&rsquo;s amazing run to Premier League glory, the 25-year-old will be one of the most watched stars at the Cup of African Nations.Once considered too small for professional football, Mahrez is now one of the biggest names at the tournament in Gabon.Three years ago, he was making his debut for Leicester in England&rsquo;s second tier Championship having played for Sarcelles, the French town where he was born.He only made his debut for Algeria in May 2014 a few months after declaring that he wanted to play for the African nation around the same time as serious riots in Sarcelles.At the age of 18, Mahrez was &ldquo;frustrated&rdquo; but determined when many of his Sarcelles teammates had signed with professional terms, according to Hayel Mbemba, a teaching assistant at Chantereine school in the Paris suburb where Mahrez was a pupil.&ldquo;Despite all that, Riyad swore that one day he would be a professional. &ldquo;At that time we were pessimistic. Today, he has made it and you can only give him respect for that.&rdquo;His hunger only grew when his father, one of his biggest supporters, died suddenly in 2006. &ldquo;It gave him the force,&rdquo; said elder brother Wahid. When Mahrez chose to play for Algeria over France, &ldquo;it was for his papa,&rdquo; he added. &ndash; AFP.
