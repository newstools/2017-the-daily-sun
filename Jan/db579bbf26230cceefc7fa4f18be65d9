THE digital age has caused a lot of changes in African culture.But the Mngomezulu clan from Nkungwini, at Ingwavuma in northern KZN, refuses to have their ancestors&rsquo; culture being corrupted by the changing times.Last Sunday, under the leadership of Chief Mpumelelo Lubelo, they held their huge annual traditional ceremony called umkhosi wencwala.Many of them, dressed in traditional gear, gathered at their clan&rsquo;s meeting place to sing traditional songs and dance.They happily feasted on umqombothi and traditional food.Prince Solomon Mngomezulu said: &ldquo;This ceremony was initiated by our ancestors ages ago, and we are still following in their footsteps. &ldquo;It is like a prayer service to us. &ldquo;Everyone is happy. Nothing serious is discussed on this day.&ldquo;We eat, drink, dance and prepare ourselves to have a great year.&rdquo;They said a special prayer to their ancestors to beg for rain to end the drought.Clan member Kati Mngomezulu told Daily Sun he was very excited to be part of the event.&ldquo;Some rain fell, which is a sign that our ancestors have blessed this event. &ldquo;This is how we connect with our late family elders. &ldquo;We have been holding the event for many years and it&rsquo;s still going strong,&rdquo; he said.
