LIVERPOOL manager Juergen Klopp will halt the club&rsquo;s slump in form and lead them to trophies, reckons midfielder Philippe Coutinho.The Merseyside club lost three home matches within a week to exit two cup competitions and leave them fourth in the Premier League table &ndash; 10 points behind Chelsea going into tonight&rsquo;s game against the leaders at Anfield.&ldquo;Yes, it has been a bad week, but we are looking beyond that. Of course we believe we can win titles under this manager and I signed because the manager is a winner,&rdquo; said Coutinho, who signed a new contract this month.&ldquo;I believe in what he does and everyone in the dressing-room believes he will take this team to titles. &ldquo;That is why I signed a new contract and that is what we want to do.&rdquo;Liverpool suffered a shock 2-1 loss to Championship side Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday in the FA Cup fourth round and Klopp was widely criticised for playing a weakened team.&ldquo;We have another opportunity straight away to bounce back and it is a good opportunity, a big game against Chelsea,&rdquo; Coutinho said.&ldquo;We have a few days to prepare everything and to go again, and that is what we must do now.&rdquo; &ndash; REUTERS
