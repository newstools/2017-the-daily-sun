THE EFF and individuals on Rustenburg's platinum belt are contributing to the Fees Must Fall student protests to push their own political agenda, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande said today."There are those who have identified student protests as part of their agenda to disrupt government," said Nzimande at a briefing on the department's state of readiness for 2017.Asked to say more, he said: "Some are political organisations like the [EFF]... Others are some ultra-left expatriate academics who seem to be experimenting."Some in the platinum belt in Rustenburg were identified as common denominators."Nzimande added: "Some political parties that may be dying may be seeing this as an opportunity to revive themselves. I don't say more than this." He said the government was ready for a possible continuation of Fees Must Fall protests, and had briefed President Jacob Zuma on its state of readiness last year.But he felt that even if the government made education completely free, there would still be those who were dissatisfied.Nzimande said he was worried that some parents were sending their children to universities overseas, instead of local ones, to avoid cancelled classes and delayed exams due to fees-related protests.This included parents in other African countries who traditionally sent their children to South Africa to study."We cannot afford to drive away rich students because we need their money in order to subsidise poor students," he said.There had also been a sudden interest in starting private universities in South Africa because a gap in the market had been created.Nzimande estimated that the protests had cost around R1 billion in damage so far and said he hoped that a permanent solution would be found in 2017.The Fees Must Fall protests appeared to take the government by surprise in October 2015 when thousands of students stormed Parliament during the medium term budget speech of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene.Weeks of clashes with police followed and Zuma announced that proposed fee increases would be frozen.For 2017, fee increases were capped at 8%, with another fee freeze for poor students and students from families with a joint income of less than R600 000.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/eff-ultra-left-academics-pushing-own-agenda-on-fees-must-fall-protests-nzimande-20170126
