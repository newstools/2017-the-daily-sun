team goodbye yesterday as he prepared to fly off to Europe to start his

confirmed the news to SunSport: “The deal went
well and I am happy Sundowns finally agreed to the move. It has been my dream

speedy winger will undergo medical tests at Ligue 1 side Montpellier first.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuJkvFV7JNiuhQccuotejdmI3OVxa45ja5o6gTncZcA0EFifhQtcVc5M1tcJi9HssLxuqvt2wQ3VeFg_s-U4xLgQMcoK4P-cttu1YWdxhNEMNCaVc5h3LuEuMe8KK6JoC7VXwDU96nuEso6j8cP9kYVI0ANzRGLst-Jnun4RwzVD9NfQfmYCscazpuAY_qXU2AQKcWs-6Jri3zmX3pN2E2wwMZf74vyvoHV-s8GIV1NYcwrptW0O8eGwgzUgbcaDVmIWMUT-u9TZpAEDE-MlFxQgA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJay99hFWOm5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

revealed that he was delighted that his dream of playing overseas was finally
happening.The
23-year-old was frustrated for a while, as the buyout clause in his contract
led to a fall-out between his agent and Downs management, who labelled the
agent a liar and said he dragged the club’s name through the mud in the media.“I will
miss my teammates, the PSL vibe, South African football flavour and our fans. I
haven’t spoken to Pitso Mosimane yet – I still have to go there and say my
goodbyes,” added Dolly.Montpellier
had earlier reacted swiftly to the initial R10 million buyout clause in Dolly’s
contract, an amount Downs boss Patrice Motsepe has said
was an “honest mistake” and was always supposed to be set at R21m. The R21m
price tag was upheld by the PSL’s Dispute Resolution Chamber.Now that
the dispute has been laid to rest, Dolly can finally fulfil his dream.He
thanked his teammates and technical staff for playing a key role in helping him
get global recognition when Downs won the Caf Champions League.The
player is ready to face unbearably cold weather conditions in Europe to reach
greater heights. He says being involved in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan
last year with Downs had given him an idea of what
to expect. Downs lost 2-0 to host side Kashima
Antlers and 4-1 to Korea Republic outfit Jeonbuk Hyundai at the club competition.“I think
everyone knows that it’s quite cold in Europe. I’ll have to adapt to my
surroundings – I am ready for it.”Dolly
says his move will pave the way for more youngsters in Mzansi to follow in his
footsteps. “I think it has been a while since a player from South Africa left
for Europe. A lot of youngsters wish to reach this goal and if I do well, it
will inspire them to follow suit.”Dolly, a
product of Downs’ development, was loaned out
Ajax Cape Town. He returned to the Brazilians in 2014.
