IT IS expected that Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma&rsquo;s candidacy for the ANC&rsquo;s presidency will get a big boost over the next week.The ANC Women&rsquo;s League was the first off the mark when it endorsed Dlamini-Zuma at the weekend, and as widely expected the ANC Youth League and MKVA are preparing to officially come out in her favour.The ANC is set to elect its new president and national leadership in December.Both the youth league and the MKVA told Daily Sun yesterday that their respective national executive committees will be sitting in the coming week to finalise their preferred candidate, but both confirmed the only name that has emerged so far in their structures is that of Dlamini-Zuma. They will, however, wait for proper procedures before making it official.ANCYL secretary-general Njabulo Nzuza has warned the league&rsquo;s structures not to be too eager in publicly pronouncing candidates&rsquo; names.&ldquo;This process must unify the ANC. We don&rsquo;t want to cause irreparable damage to the organisation,&rdquo; said Nzuza. &ldquo;The decision to come out with a name lies with the NEC.&rdquo; The NEC will be sitting in a week or two.Nzuza said the youth league was not going to compromise on the gender mix on the top six and NEC.MKVA chairman Kebby Maphatsoe admitted that it was highly likely the veterans would endorse Dlamini-Zuma as no other name has come out in their structures. &ldquo;We are working closely with the women&rsquo;s league and the youth league on this,&rdquo; said Maphatsoe.He said even though the veterans are not allocated voting delegates at the elective conference, a large number of the comrades have influential positions in the regions and branches. &ldquo;We just have to discuss the name structurally before endorsing, so we are not criticised for flouting party processes,&rdquo; he said.
