BANYANA Banyana striker Bontle Mashilo hopes she gets a chance to shine against international opposition this month and cement her place in the squad. Mashilo is part of Banyana interim coach Desiree Ellis&rsquo; 22-woman squad that will take on France in a friendly international in Saint-Denis on Reunion on 22 January. The team will start will their preparations for the friendly next Friday.Although Mashilo has been with the senior women&rsquo;s national team before, she has not yet kicked a ball in an official match. The Tshwane University of Technology player did not get to play for Banyana in the Africa Women&rsquo;s Cup of Nations in Cameroon last year. Mashilo said she hoped being called back into the team means she would finally earn her first cap. She said: &ldquo;I am happy to have been recalled. I have never played against France before but am ready to do my best and help the team. It would be a valuable experience. &ldquo;I have never played against such a big side and am eager to get my first cap. There are a lot of new players in the squad but I will work hard.&rdquo;She added that it would be easy for her to adapt to the team, as her first call-up in October last year was a learning experience at this level. &ldquo;At first it was difficult to get used to how the coach wants us to play, but now I know what to expect,&rdquo; she said. Mashilo is confident that Banyana will improve on their performance at last year&rsquo;s Afcon. She believes the experience gained at the tournament will be useful for the national team going forward. &ldquo;I think Banyana learned from the mistakes, we are willing to fix them. Things will be different in this upcoming friendly game,&rdquo; she said.
