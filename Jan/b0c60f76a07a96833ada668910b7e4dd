FAITH Mamosebo got caught up in the fire between police and land invaders when a rubber bullet hit her above her left eye last Monday.The 24-year-old thought the injury to her eye would heal quickly, because the doctor who discharged her from Lebowakgomo Hospital told her so. But Faith, from Maijane Village in Ga-Mphahlele, Limpopo, is now frustrated after optometrists at Mankweng Hospital told her she might lose sight in her left eye altogether!The third-year student at University of Limpopo said she blamed Lebowakgomo Hospital for failing to recognise that her eye was severely injured.Upon her release she was arrested by police and spent a night in jail.&ldquo;After the doctor discharged me, I thought the wound would heal, but that same night as I was lying in jail my eye remained painful.&ldquo;After I was released, I went straight back to hospital and told them of the pain I suffered. I was readmitted and transferred to Mankweng Hospital, where I was told that my eye was rotten inside and chances that I would see with it again were slim,&rdquo; she said.Health Department spokesman Derrick Kganyago said Faith was brought to Lebowakgomo Hospital after being shot in the eye.&ldquo;The doctor&rsquo;s report states that the upper eyelid was swollen and that borders at the tear were irregular but not bleeding at the time. The patient could not see clearly with the affected eye. She was also given treatment on discharge. When she returned on the second day she was referred to Mankweng Hospital,&rdquo; he said, adding that the hospital followed procedures, with Faith being given treatment and released. Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: &ldquo;We believe she was part of the group of land grabbers. She was arrested and spent a night in cells.&rdquo;
