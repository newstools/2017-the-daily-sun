STUDENTS at Central Joburg College&rsquo;s Alexandra campus protested yesterday, bringing traffic to a standstill. The angry students claimed that 72 lecturers had been fired in the past seven weeks, and a number of courses had been removed. They also claimed that R80 million was owed in outstanding salaries to lecturers and the college management was planning to close the institution down. The students burnt tyres and barricaded busy Vincent Tshabalala Road. Angie Naledi, secretary of the SRC, said: &ldquo;The college was supposed to open two weeks ago, but students were told that they should find alternatives to continue with their education. &ldquo;We want the college to run as it has been doing for years. &ldquo;We also want the fired lecturers reinstated immediately.&rdquo; English lecturer Mikateko Hlongwane said the college owed her a lot of money as she had been underpaid since 2009. Engineering lecturer Ishmael Chepape said on 9 December he received a letter to say his contract had been terminated. College spokesman Raynauld Russon said: &ldquo;Only 31 lecturers had their contracts terminated. &ldquo;The council will fully investigate the matter in order to find a solution.&rdquo; He added that students could register as the registration process was open to all.
