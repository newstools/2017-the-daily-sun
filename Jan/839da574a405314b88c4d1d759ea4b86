THERE is a 15-year-old boy who likes nothing better than being at home with his family, studying and going to church, and last year, because he passed his exams so well, he is going to grade 9.But maybe this is the reason the boy and his family are being terrorised by a gang of teenage thugs . . .&ldquo;One day those boys will burn us alive in our house,&rdquo; said the boy&rsquo;s frightened 64-year-old gogo.The gogo said the gangsters have already sworn at her but on Monday, she claimed they broke some of her windows.She called the cops.They came, but did not open a case. The trouble started in October when they told gogo&rsquo;s grandchild to join them, but he refused.She said her grandson would come home with bruises and a dirty shirt.&ldquo;He told me the gang waited for him to leave school to beat him up.&rdquo;She alleged that the gang once chased him with knifes and on another occasion, tried to strangle him with a rope at a park.&ldquo;They even put a note in his school bag. It said that he should join them if he doesn&rsquo;t want to die.&rdquo;The boy said he doesn&rsquo;t believe in groups or gangs. &ldquo;I want to live my life in the righteous way.&rdquo;He said that he knows the boys from the gang, named the Taylar Gang.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t with them because of their bad behaviour. Now they are forcing me to become one of them.&rdquo;He confirmed that they even threatened to kill him.Moroka SAPS spokesman, Constable John Serala, said that if people, like gogo, call the police and are not satisfied, they should get the cops&rsquo; details and report to the police station.&ldquo;If residents are not happy with the cops&rsquo; activities, they should lay a formal complaint,&rdquo; said Serala.
