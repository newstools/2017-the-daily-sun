IT WILL be do or die for the bottom teams in the National First
Division when the second round kicks off next month.Magesi
FC, Santos, Cape Town All Stars, Milano United and FC Cape Town are all early
candidates for relegation in the NFD and will be fighting for their lives when
the second round resumes.These
teams are in position 16, 15, 14, 13 and 12 respectively and will need to sign
players before the transfer window closes at the end of the month if they want
to change their situation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>In the
first round these teams were all poor defensively, which saw them conceding
many goals while also struggling to score.The
second round is their last chance to fight for their place in the league, but
it’s not going to be easy. The top teams will want to emulate log leaders
Thanda Royal Zulu.The two
teams that finish 15th and 16th will be relegated to the ABC Motsepe League.Rookies
Magesi, who are at the bottom of the table, have already started signing
players for the remaining 15 fixtures.Magesi
coach Shepherd Murape confirmed that they added six new players to the team who
are already training with them.He told SunSport:
“The main problem in the first round was converting our chances. So we signed
three strikers, Joseph Lekata, Themba Nevhulamba and Sifiso Silime.“The
others signings are goalkeeper Azwindini Maphaha, defender Thabo Mokgalushi and
former Polokwane City midfielder Alfred Langa.“I
believe these players will play a major role in helping us climb the ladder in
the second round,” said the coach.Former
Absa Premiership champions Santos are in 15th place with 11 points, the same
number as Magesi. They also currently face relegation at the end of this
season. Santos would then be following in the footsteps of former giants Moroka
Swallows, who were relegated last season.Santos
have struggled in the NFD in the last two seasons. They finished 13th in the
2014-15 season with 36 points and fared only a little better last season,
finishing 11th with 31 points.
