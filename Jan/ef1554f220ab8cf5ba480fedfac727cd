THE bad blood between the North West Business Forum and Premier Supra Mahumapelo looks as if it will never end.On Saturday, the forum&rsquo;s deputy secretary, Themba Gwabeni, had to escape from angry ANC supporters by jumping over a fence.The forum held a meeting in Kanana, near Rustenburg to discuss ways of removing the premier.But five taxis full of ANC members carrying knobkerries, axes and sticks arrived. They stormed into the hall and threw chairs on the stage, broke the sound system and threatened people with weapons.ANC leader Vusi Wolf said the people who organised the meeting are from Forum 4 Service Delivery, although they claim to be members of the ANC.&ldquo;We checked with the local and national ANC leadership and they didn&rsquo;t know about this meeting. &ldquo;We disrupted the meeting because it was convened outside the constitution of the ANC.&rdquo;Sello Mogodiri, the business forum&rsquo;s spokesman, said the meeting was called to address allegations of corruption, the manipulation of candidate lists and the premier&rsquo;s poor leadership.They also objected to the firing of qualified government officials who are being replaced by less experienced acting officials. ANC provincial spokesman Gerald Modise promised to return the SunTeam&rsquo;s calls, but never did.The forum has called on the premier to step down by 14 February.
