BEACHES were packed with people over the New Year&rsquo;s weekend. However, for some the festivities turned to tragedy as six people drowned in the Western and Eastern Cape.Craig Lambinon from the National Sea Rescue Institute urged the public to be careful when swimming in the sea. &ldquo;Due to the spring tide, you can expect stronger than normal currents. We urge bathers to go to beaches where lifeguards are on duty,&rdquo; he said. On Sunday afternoon, hundreds of people were asked to leave the beach at Strand in Cape Town after sharks were spotted. A 50-year-old man died after collapsing at Sunrise Beach in Muizenberg. It&rsquo;s believed he suffered a heart attack. Meanwhile in KZN, thousands of people from around Mzansi flocked to Durban beaches to celebrate the first day of the new year. Although no drownings were reported, there was reportedly chaos in some areas as many people were drunk. A police source told Daily Sun several boozers were rescued after going swimming. Other people were burnt by the hot beach sand. Nosipho Nxasane (37) said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how full the beach gets. I come here to celebrate on the first day of every year.&rdquo; Police Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko and acting national commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane visited beaches and shopping centres in Durban on Saturday. Their first stop was the Bridge City Mall in KwaMashu. They later made their way to Gateway Mall.
