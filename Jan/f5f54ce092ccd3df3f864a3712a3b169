SHE is handcuffed and hanging upside down, with her legs folded around a piece of wood which is balanced between two chairs.The crying woman is obviously in terrible pain, but her captors show no mercy.The video was first posted on the Police Pics and Clips Facebook page on 4 November. The caption asks anyone with information to come forward, but in spite of 351 shares, neither the woman nor her captors could be traced. The woman, accused of card scamming, is being interrogated by what seems to be mall security guards. They speak fluent Siswati. Mkhuhlu Village and White River near Mbombela are mentioned many times.In the video, the woman confesses she approached a couple trying to withdraw money from an offline ATM. She allegedly got the card owner&rsquo;s PIN and then swapped his card with her own. She was allegedly caught after swiping the card at Dunns clothing shop.Daily Sun sent the video to Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi, who said: &ldquo;The place doesn&rsquo;t look like a police station. &ldquo;We can only request if there&rsquo;s anyone, including the victim, with information on this issue, that they come forward.&rdquo;He said torture is a crime. But on Facebook, people showed no mercy.
