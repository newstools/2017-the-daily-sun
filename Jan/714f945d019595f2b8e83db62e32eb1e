THE gangster fired a bullet but it missed his enemy.Instead, it killed a six-month-old baby girl. Little Zahnia Woodward died in hospital last Friday. And her mum Cindy Woodward, of Ocean View in the Western Cape, took to Facebook on New Year&rsquo;s Day.She posted: &ldquo;I want them to pay for taking my entire world away from me. Right now I fear no gangster in my community because there&rsquo;s nothing more they can take away from me. I&rsquo;m not just going to let you gangsters go on living a peaceful life.&rdquo; The suffering mother also posted a photo of a smiling Zahnia and captioned it: &ldquo; The last picture of my baby alive, moments before she was so brutally taken away from me!! &ldquo;No more pain my baby. Free from this cruel world we&rsquo;re living in.&rdquo; A suspect (31) was bust over the weekend. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said the suspect is from Hout Bay, and that the organised crime unit was investigating the incident. &ndash; NEWS24
