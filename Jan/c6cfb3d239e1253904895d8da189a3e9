ZANDILE Kubheka said the flashbacks of bloodied bodies lying in her family house still haunted her at night.The 31-year-old lost three of her relatives, as well as three other people who were gunned down in a house in Georgedale, Hammarsdale in KZN.The victims were laid to rest at Mophela Cemetery over the weekend.Zandile, the sister and aunt of three of the six who were murdered, said only counselling would relieve her suffering. &ldquo;I can barely sleep at night. In my mind it still feels as if the incident happened an hour ago. I need to see a counsellor to help me get through this.&rdquo; Zandile&rsquo;s brothers, Siphelele (36) and Siyanda (26), her niece Hlengiwe Dubazana (20), Siyanda&rsquo;s two friends Siphamandla Mavundla (29) and Mcebisi Gondo (27), and Siyanda&rsquo;s girlfriend Nonhlanhla Mthalane (23) were gunned down in a suspected drug hit two weeks ago.A seventh man who survived the shooting is said to be in a stable condition in hospital.Last week, Zandile said she would flee from the village immediately after the burial as she feared for her life.But yesterday she told the People&rsquo;s Paper she had not moved yet because family elders and relatives had come to to her house to support her.&ldquo;I think I will have to stay for a few more weeks and see where I go after they leave. I&rsquo;m really not feeling safe but the presence of other people makes things easier for now.&rdquo; Last week, KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said Zandile should report the matter to the cops so it could be investigated.KZN social development spokesman Vukani Mbhele said counsellors from the Hammarsdale office were instructed to assist the families of the victims last week.&ldquo;They will be attending to the matter. Meanwhile, you can forward Zandile&rsquo;s contacts to me so she can be attended to immediately.&rdquo;
