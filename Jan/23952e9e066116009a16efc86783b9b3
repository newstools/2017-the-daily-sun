AUNTS from the Bakgatlha Ba Kgafela royal family in Moruleng, near Rustenburg, North West went on a peaceful protest yesterday. They took a damning petition to the office of the premier, accusing fugitive chief Kgosi Kgafela Kgafela, from Mochudi in Botswana, of sowing division. And that he is hell-bent on destabilise their chieftaincy in South Africa. Former South African ambassador Ntshadi Pilane-Ntshoele, the senior aunt in the royal house said: &ldquo;As the royal aunts, we represent the senior Pilane families and other women who are true members of the Moruleng community. &ldquo;We are also members of Bakgatlha Ba Kgafela traditional council.&rdquo;She added they have noticed a campaign to frustrate their efforts to find peaceful solutions, and blame this on Kgafela. They refer to him as a fugitive, unrecognised kgosi of the Bakgatlha Ba Kgafela in Botswana.Indirectly Pilane-Ntshoele put the blame at the door of the North West Provincial government and other authorities in South Africa adding . She added that they believe Kgafela Kgafela is not operating alone. One aunt said: &ldquo;We believe Kgafela does this to support individuals in the North West provincial government, in particular the office of the premier&rdquo;. &ldquo;We have also noticed a disturbing negative attitude of Mahumapelo towards the royal family of Bakgatlha Ba Kgafela in Moruleng in engagements. &ldquo;He has the audacity to make known his intentions to has introduced an administrator to run the affairs of Bakgatlha Ba Bakgafela and has even appointed a judicial commission of inquiry to look into who is the rightful Kgosi of Bakgatlha Ba Kgafela, pre-empting the findings of the commission.&rdquo; Provincial government spokesman Brian Setswambung said: &ldquo;We received the petition and will address their issues.&rdquo;
