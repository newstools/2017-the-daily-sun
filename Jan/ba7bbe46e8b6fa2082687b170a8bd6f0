IT&rsquo;S very important for a clinic to be clean and hygienic.But residents of Folweni, south of Durban said their clinic is failing them.They told Daily Sun that Nsimbini Clinic has been operating without water for more than two months. The toilets can&rsquo;t flush, so they have been locked.Thandeka Mkhize (30) travels to the clinic from Ntabankulu Village. She claimed patients relieve themselves in the bushes behind the clinic, and this is a serious health hazard.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like the water problem will be solved any time soon. When we ask the nurses and security guards, they tell us that they have no idea,&rdquo; said Thandeka. She claimed that nurses turn patients away who visit the clinic to have pregnancy tests done.&ldquo;Because the toilets at the clinic don&rsquo;t work, the nurses tell the women to urinate in small bottles at home and then bring them to the clinic,&rdquo; she claimed.&ldquo;The nurses sometimes refuse to physically examine patients because they say they don&rsquo;t have water to wash their hands.&rdquo;&ldquo;This is directly affecting their important task of taking care of patients, and it&rsquo;s not good,&rdquo; claimed Thandeka.Agiza Hlongwane from the KZN department of Health said the clinic belongs to eThekwini Municipality therefore they could not comment. However, the municipality&rsquo;s Princess Nkabane said the matter has been passed to the relevant department that will look into it before the communications department can respond to the enquiry sent by the People&rsquo;s Paper.The enquiry was sent on Tuesday. Ward Councillor Nomvula Hlomuka said residents recently brought the matter to her attention.&ldquo;I have been told that a pipe supplying the clinic with water burst in Umbumbulu. I am working on restoring the supply to the clinic,&rdquo; she said.
