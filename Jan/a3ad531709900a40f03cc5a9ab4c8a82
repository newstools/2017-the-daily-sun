Reabetswe donated about 20 bags of dog and cat food to the organisation.She said most people don&rsquo;t care about the danger posed to animals by fireworks.&ldquo;I want these animals to feel loved and to have a sense of security.&rdquo; Apart from the work she does with the SPCA, Rebeatswe also runs an organisation called Ditsala Children&rsquo;s Shield and Projects.The organisation focuses on uplifting young women.She said she plans to expand her organisation across the globe because she loves to help others. Meshack Matlou, an inspector for the animal society, said they were happy to see a young person who cares for animals.He said most of the animals at the shelter were found on the streets.The society has not yet identified the owners.&ldquo;Everyone should take care of their pets.&ldquo;Domestic animals should be kept indoors while people set off fireworks,&rdquo; he said.Matlou added that the donation came at the right time because they have rescued a lot of dogs and cats since the beginning of the year.
