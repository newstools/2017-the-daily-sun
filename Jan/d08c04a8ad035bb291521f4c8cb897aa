FADED kwaito star Bonginkosi, aka &ldquo;Zola 7&rdquo;, Dlamini is still a free agent.It emerged that the former Yizo Yizo hitmaker didn&rsquo;t sign with Mabala Noise.A source close to Zola 7 said he didn&rsquo;t sign because he initially wanted the label to take over his company, Guluva Records.&ldquo;Zola believes in doing his own thing, and that&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s been doing for over six years. He once told us he won&rsquo;t be signed to any music company as he&rsquo;s had a lot of heartbreaks.&rdquo;A second source said: &ldquo;Zola and Mabala Noise have a working relationship. Whenever he&rsquo;s needed he&rsquo;ll pitch, but he&rsquo;s not one of their artists. Last year, when Mabala Noise had a photo shoot in Magaliesburg, he wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;&ldquo;And this raised eyebrows among other artists like Major League DJz, Nasty C, Pro and Zakwe. But they were told he was busy with other stuff.&rdquo; Zola said he&rsquo;s not a member of Mabala Noise.He said: &ldquo;It looks like I&rsquo;ve never been a member of Mabala Noise I get my own gigs through my phone or texts. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out whether I&rsquo;m signing as a musician or personality. I didn&rsquo;t sign the contract because I know what happens in that contract.&rdquo;He said he tried to meet with Mabala Noise management but to no avail.&ldquo;I tried many times to meet up with management over contractual issues, but it&rsquo;s either they&rsquo;re out of the country or busy with other things,&rdquo; he said.A third source said: &ldquo;Mabala Noise hosted major events and all their artists where present &ndash; but not Zola.&rdquo; The company has also signed radio and TV personalities like Khanyi Mbau, Kay Sibiya, Mbali Nkosi and Letoya Makhene. Mabala Noise&rsquo;s spokesperson Sikhulile Nzuza said: they gave Zola a contract but he was not satisfied with somethings. &ldquo;We referred Zola to our lawyers. And when he discovered who the lawyer was, he had a problem with that because they had issues before.&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t change our lawyer for him and he didn&rsquo;t sign.&rdquo;Nzuza said he gave them an ultimatum.
