GOGO Joyce Mvundla of Kromkuil near Winterveld, north of Tshwane, said she couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night for years.The 67-year-old said she used to have nightmares and heard weird sounds on top of her roof. She then consulted different sangomas for help.&ldquo;I was told that my yard had evil spirits and the sound on top of my roof was made by a tokoloshe,&rsquo; she said.Gogo Joyce said the muthi given to her by the sangomas did not help.The gogo said she then dreamt of filling empty plastic bottles with pure tap water and put them around her yard and shack.&ldquo;The dream saved my life. I no longer have nightmares and the tokoloshe that turned my shack into its playground is gone,&rdquo; she said.It&rsquo;s almost three years now that gogo Joyce has followed her dream.And she said that she has been sleeping peacefully.&ldquo;Sometimes the things we dream about are the messages from our ancestors, and we must obey them.&rdquo;Gogo Joyce said when she first put up the bottles around her shack, her neighbours thought that she was losing her mind, but that did not bother her.&ldquo;It was hard to see people pointing and laughing at my shack. They called it a mad woman&rsquo;s house, but that did not make me doubt my ancestors&rsquo; message,&rdquo; she said.Gogo&rsquo;s neighbour, Emily Montwedi (40), said at first she thought that gogo was losing her mind because of old age.&ldquo;She asked me not to throw away the empty bottles after drinking the soft drinks but to give them to her. &ldquo;I thought that she wanted to recycle the bottles to make extra cash, but I was surprised when I saw what she did with them,&rdquo; she said.
