LEGENDARY North West journalist Obakeng Gopane has died. Gopane, who was popularly known as &ldquo;OO&rdquo;, retired four years ago after working for the SABC for over 30 years. At the time of his death, he was farming. News of his death broke on SABC&rsquo;s Motsweding FM on Tuesday afternoon and was later confirmed on social media. It came just days after former news reader Boyce Mohutsioa&rsquo;s death. Gopane died after a short illness. Charles Matlou, SABC head of news for North West, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only a sad loss for the SABC but the entire community. &ldquo;Gopane was proud to speak Setswana. &ldquo;He and Boyce helped preserve the language and they&rsquo;re both irreplaceable.&rdquo; Matlou said it was a loss for the younger generation, which could still learn a lot from Gopane and Mohutsioa. A memorial service will be held for Mohutsioa today at the SABC North West studios and Gopane&rsquo;s service will be held tomorrow. Mohutsioa will be buried in Boekenhout near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, on Saturday, while Gopane will be laid to rest in Zeerust on Sunday. Gopane helped younger journalists like Thebeetsile &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo; Keameditse win awards and move forward in their careers. News of Gopane&rsquo;s death broke while listeners and colleagues were still mourning Mohutsioa on memorial shows. Peter Moshodi, a fan of both men, wrote on social media: &ldquo;Oh, no! &ldquo;Lightning doesn&rsquo;t strike in the same place twice but at SABC North West, another star has fallen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough now. God, please stretch out your hand of mercy.&rdquo;
