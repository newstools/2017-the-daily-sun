A HOUSE was set alight in zone 4 of Ga-Rankuwa, north of Pretoria, apparently by nyaope addicts who were fighting about who should live there.A neighbour, Mmaletsatsi Nkomo (61), said she was at home watching TV on Friday when she heard the sound of breaking glass from the house.&ldquo;I went out to investigate and saw the house was burning,&rdquo; she told Daily Sun.&ldquo;The flames were so high that I was scared the fire would jump over to my house.&rdquo;She said the owner of the house, who was a pastor, had died 15 years ago and his children moved to other places.&ldquo;The house was rented by various people. They could not stay long because they claimed they were bothered by a ghost that came to pray in the house every day. People started calling it a ghost house.&rdquo;Mmaletsatsi said nyaope addicts started stealing things from the house. Other addicts made the house their home and lived there.On Friday a fight broke out between two groups of addicts.Another resident said: &ldquo;I heard them swearing at each other and I thought they had smoked and were high. Little did I know it would end in the house being set alight.&rdquo;Captain Rheineth Motlana said the police are investigating a case of arson.
