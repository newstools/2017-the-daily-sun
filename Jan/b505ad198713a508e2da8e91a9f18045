JUJU was in a mean mood when he briefed journalists on his party&rsquo;s action programme for the year.&nbsp; Nobody was spared, but ANC presidential front runners got an extra tongue-lashing.&nbsp; HE CALLED CYRIL RAMAPHOSA SELF-CENTRED, AND NKOSAZANA DLAMINI-ZUMA CORRUPT.&nbsp; The EFF leader reflected on a range of issues, from the ANC succession battle to the new public protector. Speaking about outgoing chairwoman of the African Union, Dlamini-Zuma, he said: &ldquo;For her to be receiving an award from the Guptas, even if she said she will donate the money to charity, means she is corrupt.&rdquo; He said he was waiting for the day when a journalist asked her a question about state capture. &ldquo;If she starts mumbling her answers, that means she is corrupt,&rdquo; Malema said.He added that Dlamini-Zuma could get the presidency if her ex-husband President Jacob Zuma wanted it, because he always got what he wanted in the ANC.He said she was not a legitimate candidate but rather a front for Zuma to protect himself once he was out of office.He pointed out that the ANC Youth League, which had supported her, were now changing their tune and were set to throw their weight behind Free State Premier Ace Magashule.He said Zuma&rsquo;s son Duduzane told Zuma the Guptas did not want Dlamini-Zuma.Speaking about Ramaphosa, he said: &ldquo;Shame. Cyril will not get the presidency,&rdquo; adding that Ramaphosa didn&rsquo;t attend Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s inauguration because he was bitter about the deputy presidency at the time.Malema said it was a terrible mistake to support Busisiwe Mkhwebane as the public protector.He said he&rsquo;d received information from spooks that she was a spy but he believed in second chances.&ldquo;We took a puppet from the Gupta kitchen and planted her there. She is proving without fail that she was sent there to destroy that office.&rdquo;He said they were looking at ways of removing her from office.Malema dropped a bombshell when he said State Security Minister David Mahlobo was funding people to dig up dirt against Johann Rupert.He said this was part of the campaign against Absa, which allegedly looted state funds on the eve of the democratic order.Malema rejected calls for his party to join the campaign.&ldquo;The Absa nonsense is not legit and I will not be told by the EFF opposition how to act.&rdquo;He said they will hold Absa accountable on their own terms.When they announced their own campaign last year against Absa, they never mentioned when they would occupy banks. Malema threatened to reveal how Mahlobo was funding the campaign, adding the minister had paid people R10 million to destroy the EFF.He also launched an attack on Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe and called on Zimbabweans to be brave.&ldquo;Tell grandpa it&rsquo;s enough. He must go.&rdquo;
