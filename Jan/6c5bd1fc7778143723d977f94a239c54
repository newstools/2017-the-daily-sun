LATE gospel musician S&rsquo;fiso Ncwane&rsquo;s tribute concert on New Year&rsquo;s Eve was a conservative affair.This because several top gospel artists billed to perform at the event had pulled a no-show. According to sources, Deborah Fraser, Dr Tumi Makweya, Andile KaMajola, Lebo Sekgobela, Babo Ngcobo and Omega Khunou stayed away due to non-payment.A source alleged the annual event, dubbed Gospel All Stars and staged at Durban Centrum Park, KwaZulu-Natal, was titled #LetTheNcwaneLegacyContinue, &ldquo;to suit the occasion&rdquo;.&ldquo;These artists and S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s family never showed up,&rdquo; the source said.But S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s family and the musicians did not take kindly to the allegations.According to the late musician&rsquo;s sister, Gugu, the Ncwanes were unaware of the event.&ldquo;We would have loved to be part of the concert,&rdquo; Gugu said.&ldquo;But we were not invited.&rdquo;Dr Tumi cited non-payment as his reason for not attending.&ldquo;We never agreed on payment and communication was poor,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take my band from Joburg to Durban for a free performance.&rdquo;When contacted for comment, Deborah confirmed she didn&rsquo;t pitch.&ldquo;S&rsquo;fiso had asked me to be part of this event and I agreed,&rdquo; Deborah said.&ldquo;But organisers failed to negotiate payment and wanted a free performance. Things don&rsquo;t work like that, as we&rsquo;re also working.&rdquo;Lebo also complained about non-payment.&ldquo;There was no indication of how I&rsquo;d be paid or be transported from Botswana to Durban,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Everything was vague, so I decided not to attend.&rdquo;Omega said he had dropped all his gigs for S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s tribute.He said: &ldquo;My understanding was that we&rsquo;d be paid as tickets were sold and our faces were used to market the event. I only realised the day before the event that there&rsquo;d be no payment, so I didn&rsquo;t pitch.&rdquo;Andile and Babo were not available for comment.Event organiser, Thobile Mchunu, said: &ldquo;We had no money. We used it for S&rsquo;fiso&rsquo;s funeral. Luckily, some artists understood and performed for free.&rdquo;
