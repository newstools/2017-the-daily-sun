WHAT was meant to be a dignified event turned into a war of words! This after Busisiwe Modisakeng, the Sedibeng municipal mayor, and a family member of one of the victims of the 1991 Sebokeng Massacre were at each other&rsquo;s throats. The fight began when Nokufa Mthombeni, a relative of one of the victims and a member of the Khulumani Support Group, made a speech at the 26th anniversary of the massacre held at Evaton Cemetery in the Vaal on Wednesday. Nokufa, addressing the crowd, said the 39 victims died in vain and she was certain they were turning in their graves. She said the victim&rsquo;s families were unemployed and living in poverty.&ldquo;I would be lying if I said I am happy with the way this event is being handled. &ldquo;We never said we wanted fancy office jobs, all we are asking for is something to help us survive.&rdquo; Nokufa then took a swipe at Modisakeng. &ldquo;I expected changes now that a woman is leading the municipality but nothing has changed. We can&rsquo;t be waiting for those 12kg free maize meals they give us.&rdquo;Modisakeng took offence and responded angrily. &ldquo;If you want to go, you can go. Shut up! This is a government event and not an arena for political battles. &ldquo;If you have issues you want to discuss, come to my office, my door is always open. People mustn&rsquo;t push me. &ldquo;I will never change the programme just because I am a woman. I will not promise you jobs. &ldquo;Where will I get them? I will carry on with the programme the previous mayor began. If I wasn&rsquo;t a woman you would not be getting those groceries. &ldquo;The budget for that is closed but I pushed for it,&rdquo; she said.
