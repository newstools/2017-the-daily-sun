IT WAS the training he got in the boxing ring all those years ago that has kept top SA boxing trainer Keith Rass on the straight and narrow &ndash; and now he wants to repay the favour.Rass (52) credits the sport for keeping him out of trouble in his youth.As a youngster growing up in the rough neighbourhood of Claremont, near Westbury south of Joburg, drugs and gangsterism were the order of the day, but thanks to boxing he was able to navigate his way to safety. The 2016 Trainer of the Year nominee believes just getting nominated will help him make a difference. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have earned a nomination to show people from my area good things do happen. I once trained a few guys but stopped due to a lack of facilities &ndash; and they went back to a life of drugs,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Still, that was an amazing opportunity. It showed me first-hand that I was changing lives. &ldquo;I have not given up on those guys. My wish is to team up with parents in my community to get these youngsters to stay out of trouble,&rdquo; said Rass.The former SA featherweight contender is determined to make a meaningful contribution to society. &ldquo;I want to guide the youth because here drugs, stealing cars and gangsterism are the norm,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is an opportunity to show these guys that I was just like them. If I can do it, they can too. It would be amazing to give something back and show the kids that they can aspire to great things as well,&rdquo; he explained.Rass has guided two boxing cousins, Gideon &ldquo;Hardcore&rdquo; Buthelezi and Bongani &ldquo;Wonderboy&rdquo; Mahlangu, to world titles. Buthelezi won the World Boxing Association Africa super flyweight and International Boxing Organisation World super flyweight titlex under his tutelage. Mahlangu captured the SA and World Boxing Organisation International super bantamweight titles and International Boxing Federation title with Rass as his trainer.
