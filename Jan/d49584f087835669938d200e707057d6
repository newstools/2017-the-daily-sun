Some people you don&rsquo;t even have to ask if they had a great holiday &ndash; you can see it by their chubby look. It&rsquo;s all good to indulge a bit over the festive period, but now&rsquo;s the time to fix that and get back into shape. SunWellbeing got some advice on getting back to your best from training specialist Ivana Buchanan, at Zone Fitness. &ldquo;The truth is, we usually gain weight a lot quicker than we lose it and we resort to unrealistic New Year&rsquo;s resolutions in the hope of shedding the guilt and those few extra pounds &ndash; only to give up after a week,&rdquo; she warned. Here is her guide: - The moment of truth&nbsp;We can&rsquo;t all look like models on the cover of a fitness magazine because that&rsquo;s a combination of rare genetics, strict discipline and the magic of Photoshop. Despite this we should do our best to bring that beauty to the fore. &ldquo;Start by avoiding exercises and eating plans that promise unrealistic goals. Instead, aim to be a healthy version of yourself. &ldquo;Gyms are equipped with machinery that offer a wide range of exercises to choose from. Focus on strength training as well as attaining cardiovascular fitness. It is important to maintain a healthy balance between the two.&rdquo; - What you put in is what you get out&nbsp; Diets are probably hated more than most things, especially because it seems so hard to just go through with it. But what if it could actually be liberating?&nbsp; Buchanan said healthy eating should be viewed as a lifestyle shift and not a strict regime.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can adopt a lifestyle where the only goal is to eat as healthily as possible, there will be room for a day where you can still eat your favourite chocolate,&rdquo; said Buchanan.
