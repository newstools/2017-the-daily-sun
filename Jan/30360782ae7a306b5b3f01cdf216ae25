THE pumpkin is so big it&rsquo;s difficult for a man to pick it up.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s because it weighs more than 100kg!&nbsp; The Msimangas from Vuka kasi near Bethlehem, Free State said when they planted the pumpkin last year, they never expected it to grow so big.&nbsp; Mammote Msimanga (27) said she was shocked when her father brought the pumpkin into the house on Tuesday.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was the first time I had seen a pumpkin that big. It was huge.&nbsp; &ldquo;We called other family members to come and see what we were witnessing,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would probably have made it to the Guinness World Records book, but we have already cut it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It can be eaten raw and has a sweet taste like paw paw.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will plant another pumpkin that will hopefully grow to be bigger than this one.&nbsp; &ldquo;My brother lifts weights and he says it weighs close to 135kg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sajene Msimanga (55), Mammote&rsquo;s dad, said he got the pumpkin at his gogo&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; &ldquo;The seed was planted in August and we never thought it would get this big.&nbsp; &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t fit into the car and I needed to bring it to my house in a bakkie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some say it&rsquo;s even sweeter when it&rsquo;s baked.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a pumpkin this size.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the Guinness World Records, the record for the largest pumpkin was set in 2014 by Beni Meier in Switzerland.&nbsp; His pumpkin weighed a whopping 1&thinsp;054kg.&nbsp; The local record is held by Pinkie Swart from Heidelberg, Gauteng, who grew a pumpkin weighing 497kg a few years ago.&nbsp;
