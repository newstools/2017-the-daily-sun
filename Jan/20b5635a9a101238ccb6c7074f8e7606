THE thug got into Vusi Mbambo&rsquo;s flat and was caught red-handed as he looked for things of value.But apparently the 20-year-old thought he would be moered, so he chose to jump from the eighth floor! He died instantly when he landed on a balcony on the first floor.The shocking incident happened at Constantia Mansions in Durban&rsquo;s St George&rsquo;s Street on Friday.Vusi (25) told Daily Sun he had left his room for a few minutes to go to the communal toilet.When he returned he found the thug allegedly helping himself to his belongings. Vusi said before he could utter a word, the thug threw himself out of the eighth floor and landed on the first floor, where he died.Vusi said he hadn&rsquo;t locked the door when he went to the toilet but had only closed the burglar bars behind him. &ldquo;I am shocked by the whole incident. I would not have killed the man because I don&rsquo;t have valuables in my house except for an old TV set.&ldquo;Maybe I would have only given him a few slaps and let him go,&rdquo; said Vusi.The area is close to Albert Park, which is home to scores of homeless people.Residents said since the park&rsquo;s invasion by vagrants a few years ago there had been numerous break-ins. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said Point police have opened an inquest docket for investigation.
