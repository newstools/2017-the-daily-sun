CASTER Semenya&rsquo;s mission to reclaim the 800m world title is already on a roll.Semenya, who announced her arrival on the international scene at the IAAF World Championships in Berlin, Germany, in 2009, is tipped to return to her glory days at this year&rsquo;s World Championships in London, England, in August. The athlete from Limpopo was unbeaten in the 800m event last season and had a fantastic 2016 that saw her clinch the Diamond League Series, the African Senior Athletics Championship and the Olympic Games titles. Jean Verster, Semenya&rsquo;s coach, said she was already hard at training to prepare for a busy season ahead.Semenya, the reigning SA Sports Woman of the Year, is also making a big difference off the track too. She is reaching out to needy girls by providing them with much-needed hygiene products, making huge donations to schools across the country last year. The 26-year-old University of Pretoria student has now ventured into business, joining forces with Famram Solutions as co-owner. She also endorses one of their flagship brands. Verster said his star athlete would be unstoppable again in this season: &ldquo;She is working hard and is focused on being the world&rsquo;s best in her event. &ldquo;Her biggest objective is to reclaim her world title &ndash; and she is more than capable of doing that. &ldquo;But she is not only focused on running. A good athlete is judged by what they do off the track too.&rdquo; Semenya said she was eager to make a difference by changing women&rsquo;s lives:&ldquo;As an athlete I have been able to reach out to communities around the country, and I believe my involvement with this brand will enable me to extend that reach even further.&rdquo; &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s health is an ongoing issue, particularly in rural communities. I look forward to playing an important role by assisting in providing cost-effective solutions.&rdquo;
