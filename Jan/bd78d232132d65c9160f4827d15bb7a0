AFTER realising that most men had a common problem with small 4-5s, sangoma Mandla Zulu decided to consult his ancestors to help the men. And his ancestors did not disappoint, but gave him an idea. He claims they told him the ingredients for an imbiza, which serves as a solution to the men&rsquo;s problem.Mandla (38) told Daily Sun his imbiza has revived many marriages that were falling apart.The sangoma from Folweni area, south of Durban said many men come to him at night as they don&rsquo;t want to be seen with him. He said he did research on why most marriages didn&rsquo;t work out and found out that the most common reason was men who failed to satisfy their wives between the sheets.&ldquo;Some come to me crying, saying their wives are dumping them. But instead of feeling sorry for them, I just laugh because it&rsquo;s easy to fix their problems.&rdquo; Mandla said sometimes the wives come to ask him to help their husbands. His imbiza can be collected from his home and &shy;also at Isipingo where sells from a table. A customer praised Mandla&rsquo;s imbiza. &ldquo;I went to him last year after my 4-5 stopped working. I drank the imbiza and now my wife loves me even more.&rdquo;
