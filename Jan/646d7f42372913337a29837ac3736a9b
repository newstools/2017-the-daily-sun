THE Hawks are investigating complaints that the SABC has not abided by its ruling to lift the ban on airing protest footage, Icasa said on Tuesday.A criminal charge it laid at Bramley police station on 28 November had been escalated to the Hawks, Icasa councillor Nomvuyiso Batyi told Parliament's portfolio committee on communications today.They had not yet received a case number from the Hawks.Icasa had been battling since July last year to get the SABC to provide proof that it would abide by its ruling to withdraw the ban.On 26 May last year, the SABC banned the airing of footage of violent protests on its television stations. Icasa held public hearings about the decision. On 11 July, it instructed the SABC to reverse its decision.Batyi said the SABC's defence was that it never actually implemented the 26 May protest policy, but only announced it.ANC MP Mondli Gungubele said it would not help the broadcaster if the Hawks only finished its investigation in 2019. He asked Icasa if it was free and able to execute its mandate.DA MP Phumzile van Damme congratulated Icasa for taking action, but agreed with Gungubele that Icasa could "show more teeth".Batyi said the Icasa Act allows the authority to lay criminal charges to enforce its orders."We cannot take the law into our own hands. We have to go to the Hawks [police]," she said.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi was not immediately available for comment.The maximum fine a person or entity who violates an Icasa order can receive is R1 million, or one year in jail.She said thus far, they had investigated the SABC as an organisation. No monetary fine had been considered, as the protest policy had resulted in no financial loss or gain.Cope MP William Madisha said it would help Parliament and Icasa to investigate "criminal" individuals.Just after the banning, SABC COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng said at a press briefing: "No one is going to tell us what to do" and "I don&rsquo;t know what is SABC censoring".Batyi said Icasa had followed up with the attorneys of the eight SABC journalists who were fired, and then re-hired, for speaking out against the policy.The attorneys said none of them had received formal notification that the "protest policy" had been lifted, and that a climate of fear still prevailed at the broadcaster.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/hawks-investigating-sabc-protest-policy-icasa-20170131
