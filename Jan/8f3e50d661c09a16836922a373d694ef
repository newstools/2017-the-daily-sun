WHEN informal traders in KwaMashu, north of Durban, were given a proper place to sell their chickens, they were relieved.They thought they would never have to worry about rainy days, but now they are stressed. Some of the drains in the building they rent are overflowing and have dirty and smelly water coming out of them! They feel the dirty water will make their chickens sick. They want eThekwini Municipality to urgently intervene.A trader, Thembinkosi Khubisa (70), said the drain problem started three weeks ago.&ldquo;We are not sure what caused the drains to overflow. I informed the municipality. They came, but the problem continues.&rdquo; He said the traders have been forced to clean out the water with buckets. &ldquo;The drain in the storeroom where the chickens are kept overnight also has a problem.&rdquo; Another trader, Nomfundo Zulu (59), said cleaning out the water has also made them and their chickens sick. &ldquo;If our chickens die our families will also suffer.&rdquo;Khaye Nkwanyana, KZN Department of Agriculture spokesman, said: &ldquo;They should contact me and we will send officials who deal with livestock. The livestock officials will make an assessment.&rdquo; Mandla Nsele, municipal spokesman, said: &ldquo;The matter was attended to by the contractor appointed by the city architect&rsquo;s department. There seemed to be a major problem, and the city has appointed another contractor with a jet machine to resolve the problem.&rdquo;
