THE gang had been robbing residents with no regard for how hard they had worked for their few luxury goods like TVs and sound systems.They kept coming back, knocking on doors at night and then forcing their way in to commit their evil deeds.But fed-up residents would take no more. They accused the police of not doing anything, found two of the suspects themselves and beat them to death!The residents said this was to set an example to other thugs, saying they would pay with their lives if they ever stole from the people of Madidi, outside Klipgat, North West.The incident happened yesterday in the early hours of the morning. Residents went to the suspects&rsquo; houses, where they managed to find two of them.They beat them with whatever they could lay their hands on until the suspects&rsquo; bodies lay lifeless in the dust. Then they threw their bodies in a dam. Police tried for hours to get to the bodies, but residents blocked the road.The residents told Daily Sun that police didn&rsquo;t take them seriously when they complained about the high crime rate in their area.They said the spate of house robberies started in October last year and that they had reported the gang of armed young men. One victim said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been living in fear for too long. These boys were making our lives hell.&rdquo; Other residents condemned the mob justice, saying people shouldn&rsquo;t take the law into their own hands.
