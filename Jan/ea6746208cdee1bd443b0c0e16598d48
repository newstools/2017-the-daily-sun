THE local man pulled out a gun in broad daylight in front of other residents and shot Albert Mashego seven times. Now he has been released on bail, which has left the dead man&rsquo;s family living in fear. They believe he may come for them too. Albert&rsquo;s family, from Kgautswane near Ohrigstad in Limpopo, said they laughed at the suspect&rsquo;s pleas for forgiveness while he was awaiting his bail bid. Albert (44) was murdered early in December. His killer then apparently sped off in his vehicle. The car was later found abandoned on the R36 outside Burgersfort and the suspect handed himself over two days later.Cops said the killing was caused by a conflict over soccer players, as both the suspect and Albert owned soccer teams in the village.The scene of the murder was the home of Highlands Park midfielder Surprise Moriri&rsquo;s aunt, Stella Mnisi.&ldquo;We are still shocked the court released him,&rdquo; said Albert&rsquo;s brother Lolo (35). &ldquo;This man has been sending us messages from prison, saying he regrets what he did and begging us not to challenge his bail bid. We told him we wanted him to rot in jail.&ldquo;This man killed my brother in cold blood. Nothing will stop him from coming after us as a family too.&rdquo; Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said two firearms believed to have been used in the murder have been sent for tests. &ldquo;The suspect was released on bail on condition that he does not interfere either with witnesses or the victim&rsquo;s family. If he does, he should immediately be reported to the police.&rdquo;
