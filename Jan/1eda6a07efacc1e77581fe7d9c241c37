The man is now in hospital, while his friend, who was the real target made a speedy recovery after the ordeal.Mandla Ngcobo (53) from Mofolo South in Soweto said he&rsquo;s lucky to be alive. He said his friend had visited him and that after having some beers he went to sleep in his bedroom, while his friend lay on the sofa.&ldquo;I feel so sorry for my friend. He suffered the most hits from the panga.&ldquo;I heard him screaming for help in the middle of the night. Before I knew what was happening, I saw a man standing next to my bed with a panga. He hacked me on the head with it.&rdquo; He said he wrestled with the man and suffered injuries to his legs as he tried to defend himself. &ldquo;The man ran away and my friend and I crawled outside to seek help from a tenant in the outside shack.&rdquo; The tenant had by then already fled, fearing for his life, but luckily he called cops and emergency services. &ldquo;We nearly died,&rdquo; said Mandla.He said he opened a case at Moroka Police Station but he told Daily Sun that when he went back to the cop shop to get the details of his case, he was told it had been closed by a top official at the station. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how a case can be opened and closed on the same day. I want police to trace the suspects.&rdquo;Captain Kay Makhubela, Gauteng provincial police spokesman, said a case of assault was opened at Moroka Police Station. He said no one had been arrested yet and that police were still investigating the case.
