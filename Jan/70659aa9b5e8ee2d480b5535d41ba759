NEW Free State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka&rsquo;s immediate mission is to take troubled Ea Lla Koto from the backwaters where they look like relegation candidates and steady the ship.But considering where they come from this season and what they have been through, Letsoaka has a mountain to climb to do what ex-coach Giovani Solinas failed to achieve.There was a stage where the club had a &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign on their front door. Players flew all over like birds seeing a marauding cat and even Denis Lavagne called it a day.This is the moment where club general manager Rantsi Mokoena would remember his saviour Kinnah Phiri who was a loyal soldier like Themba Sithole.Sithole will assist Letsoaka as they try to elevate Ea Lla Koto from 14th place in the PSL log to at least a top eight finish in their remaining 15 matches.Letsoaka wants this to happen as soon as possible before clubs reach the 25th round &ldquo;because clubs can be dangerous whey are left with five matches to spare&rdquo;.&ldquo;This is the pressure that I can handle, trust me,&rdquo; Letsoaka told SunSport yesterday.&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want us to wait until we are left with five or eight matches to play because there is a lot of tension. &ldquo;This team has the capability to consolidate their position. &ldquo;We just need to collect enough points and be safe.&rdquo;The 53-year old from Senekal in the Free State returns to Ea Lla Koto, a club where he played for over 10 years, and refers to it as home. He said they would be going to the market to reinforce the side with quality and strengthen their weak positions.
