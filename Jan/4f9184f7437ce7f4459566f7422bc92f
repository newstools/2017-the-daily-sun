THE death toll among initiates during the Eastern Cape summer circumcision season has dropped! Last year, 46 initiates died and some of the dozens admitted to hospital lost their manhood. But during this summer season, only 29 initiates have died. The OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo municipalities were the worst affected. Nelson Mandela Bay also registered the death of an initiate (19) after enjoying a zero death rate for years. But the death was not related to circumcision &ndash; the initiate was found dead in his hut after being declared fit to go home. The department of co-operative governance and traditional affairs said the decrease this year was a result of increased monitoring and involvement by authorities.Provincial department spokesman Mamnkeli Ngam said: &ldquo;Despite the improvement, we still aren&rsquo;t happy. This figure is too high as we have been aiming for zero deaths in the province. &ldquo;So we cannot say we are happy with the reduction when some initiates have died. &ldquo;But we thank the involvement of the traditional initiation monitoring team that lessened the risks during this period.&rdquo;&ldquo;The team included doctors supplied by the department of health who visited illegal and legal initiation schools in the province. &ldquo;Initiates in illegal amabhoma have been integrated into the legal ones. During the visits, the teams found cases of septicaemia, illegal circumcisions, boys who circumcise themselves and dehydration.&ldquo;Some 36 initiates were admitted to hospitals,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;Our hospitals are not overcrowded as initiates come and go. They don&rsquo;t spend too much time there. There were no amputations.&ldquo;Nine iingcibi have been arrested in connection with an initiate&rsquo;s death and police opened 18 inquest dockets,&rdquo; said Ngam.
