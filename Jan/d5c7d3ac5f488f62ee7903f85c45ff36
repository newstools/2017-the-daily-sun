JODAN Frank (48) tells sad stories through art.Jodan from Bertrams in Joburg creates art which shows the poverty experienced by members of the Chewa tribe in Malawi in the past century.&ldquo;My work symbolises the dry season that took place in 1949,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;There was starvation and a lot of people had to eat roots and fruit to survive.&rdquo;He said the wells were dry and many people died from hunger.&ldquo;I make wooden figures of skinny men and women. &ldquo;I sell them as a pair to show unity between the two.&rdquo; The artist emphasised that men and women are nothing without each other. Jodan said his pairing represents couples in different families. &ldquo;I use different colours of beads to cover their bodies.&rdquo;He uses wood from the ebony tree found only in Malawi. &ldquo;It is very strong. It does not crack and it can last up to 100 years.&rdquo; Jodan learnt his craft from his father, who died in 1982.The artist also uses reggae music to warm up before he starts working on his art. It takes him an hour to create a pair of wooden figures. He sells a small pair for R50 and a larger pair for R100. Jodan describes art as a window into the past and present. &ldquo;Through art we can see our history.&rdquo;
