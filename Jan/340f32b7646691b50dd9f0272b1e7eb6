AS THE new year approached, people all over Mzansi celebrated.But in extension 3 of Orange Farm residents were living in fear after a bloodthirsty gang threatened them with terror.And on Wednesday the gang made good on its promise by hunting down and slaughtering a young man.Today, 14 suspected members of the notorious Kgwaba Gang will appear in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court on charges of murder.The gang of alleged killers was bust over the weekend after the shocking murder of Pheelo Makate (28).His mum, Dipuo Makate (60), told Daily Sun Pheelo was in his room with two friends when all hell broke loose.&ldquo;We were watching TV when one of Pheelo&rsquo;s friends rushed into the house screaming for help. &ldquo;I went to see what was happening and found the gang armed with pangas, knives and knobkerries,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I ran there and found him bleeding. I called out his name and he responded by saying &lsquo;Mama&rsquo;. &ldquo;Minutes later, while we were waiting for an ambulance, he died,&rdquo; she said. Pheelo&rsquo;s nephew, Kagiso Makate (19), said his uncle did not deserve to die like that.&ldquo;Only a piece of his throat was still attached. He had deep wounds all over his body and his blood flowed into the street like a cow had just been slaughtered,&rdquo; he said. Angry community members said they had earlier held two meetings to try and find a solution to the violence in the area.They told Daily Sun they had been living in fear since last month after the leader of the gang, a traditional healer, promised blood would flow.&ldquo;One day he fired several shots into the air and instructed members of his gang to attack residents at random,&rdquo; said one resident. Police spokesman Captain Johannes Motsiri said: &ldquo;Of the 14 suspects arrested, eight were released into the care of their parents because they are minors. The rest will appear in court today.&rdquo;
