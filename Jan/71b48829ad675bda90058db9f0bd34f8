A WITNESS has come forward and described the gruesome scene when a jea- lous Khayelitsha cop killed his girlfriend and her mum on Boxing Day.The 35-year-old police constable turned the gun on himself afterwards and died on the spot. Aviwe Ndlazi told Daily Sun the cop first hit the mum, Sindiswa Dayimane (50), over the head with an empty bottle after she refused to say where her daughter was.Aviwe said Sindiswa screamed for help and her daughter Bongiwe (24), came rushing from the bedroom to see what was happening. &ldquo;Upon seeing his girlfriend the cop then turned the gun on the mother and pulled the trigger as the girlfriend watched. &ldquo;He then pointed the gun at his girlfriend and shot her before turning the gun on himself. &ldquo;Bongiwe&rsquo;s five year-old child survived the attack because he had hidden under the bed,&rdquo; said Aviwe. The incident happend in Ntulo Street in Chris Hani kasi, Site C in Cape Town. The family of the dead women expressed their anger towards the ruthless cop. &ldquo;If he wanted to die why didn&rsquo;t he just kill himself rather than killing my aunt and my sister,&rdquo; said family member Siyabulela Ngquza. Siyabulela said he received a call from a neighbour informing him of the bad news. &ldquo;I was shocked. They died like dogs at the hands of a person who claimed to love my sister,&rdquo; said a teary Siyabulela, adding that at one point he told the cop to stop abusing Bongiwe. &ldquo;I could see he was jealous and abusive and I told him not to mistreat my sister, but he didn&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; he said. Police spokesman Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident and said police were still investigating the matter.&ldquo;A murder case and an inquest have been opened for investigation.&rdquo;
