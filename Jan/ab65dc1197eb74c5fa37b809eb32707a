NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete told supporters at the ANC's 105th birthday celebrations in Mbombela at the weekend that "the ANC is not corrupt".Speaking on Sunday at a packed Mbombela Stadium, she said that those who were corrupt were not from the ANC."The ANC is not corrupt," Mbete told the crowd."We do not have any policy that is called corruption in the ANC. Those who are corrupt and stealing money from the government are not sent by the organisation."She urged members of the ANC in Mpumalanga to continue living "in an exemplary manner", to set a good example for the rest of the country.Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza followed her address by saying the party would gather up and reinstate those who had left the organisation.We will "bring them back home", he said."We know all our people who got lost, and we also know where they are. We will bring them all back, one by one, because this is the only way we can bring back our dignity in the organisation," said Mabuza.He said members should stop fighting each other, but rather fight to bring back dignity to the ANC."Unity should start from national level going down. Unity is very important and it is also important for the national to be unity [sic] so we can all follow on that example," said Mabuza.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-is-not-corrupt-mbete-20170130
