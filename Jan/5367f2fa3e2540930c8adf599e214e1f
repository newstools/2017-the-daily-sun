A NUMBER of people have been left in debt after losing large amounts of money to con artists. They claim they can increase their money with the help of the ancestors. But on Friday, the cops pounced and three suspects were arrested and charged with fraud in Krugersdorp, Mogale City. Sergeant Tshepiso Mashale, Krugersdorp police spokeswoman, said the three men were suspected of conning a number of people between April and November last year. &ldquo;Police have been working tirelessly to trace and find evidence. They finally had a breakthrough on Friday and arrested suspects.&rdquo; Mashale said a complainant said he was scammed after replying to an advert claiming to be able to multiply his money.&ldquo;The complainant went to the men&rsquo;s offices in Joburg CBD and they showed him a large amount of money in a steel box. The complainant was told he would become rich if he brought R35 000 in cash.&rdquo; The complainant and his wife allegedly sold their vehicle and got a bank loan.&ldquo;Many attempts were made by the complainant to get his money back after the suspects failed to deliver on their promises.&rdquo; After the victim opened a case on Friday, the cops went to the suspects&rsquo; offices and found what looked like a traditional healer&rsquo;s consultation room. Mashale said the cops found documents belonging to victims and fake R100 notes.The cops appealed to anyone who has been a victim of the same scam to come forward. The three suspects appeared in the Krugersdorp Magistrates Court on Monday and will reappear soon.
