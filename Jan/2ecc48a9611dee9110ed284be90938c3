RESIDENTS of Houtkop near the Vaal were left homeless on Wednesday. This is after their houses and shacks were demolished by the Red Ants. The residents claim to have been living in the area since the late 1990s.Resident Esther Sebothoma (57) said she moved into the area in 1997 and had been paying rent to an unknown person. &ldquo;When the landlord, who was only identified as Chapin, died, someone who claimed to be her daughter told us to leave the place because she was selling it. &ldquo;She cut off the electricity and we stopped paying rent. The lady went quiet for years and now we&rsquo;ve found out that she sold the place. We were kicked out like dogs,&rdquo; said Esther.Esther said they received letters of eviction last year. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t take them seriously because we knew this area was not owned by anyone.&rdquo;Two houses and shacks were demolished while some of the residents were not home. Red Ants spokesman Selby Don said the eviction has been changed into a relocation.&ldquo;The shack dwellers were moved to phase five in Tshepisong and had their shacks rebuilt.&ldquo;The process was a smooth one and no casualties were reported on the day.&rdquo;
