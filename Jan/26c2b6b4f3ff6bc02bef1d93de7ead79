DESPERATE parents are still queuing for school placements and this has led to some schools trying to cash in on the situation. New Comet Primary School in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni is allegedly selling places for up to R3 000. Frustrated parents from Delmore, Angelo, Jerusalem and Comet squatter camps contacted Daily Sun after they were turned away by the school for not having money to pay for places. On Friday, the SunTeam visited the school and found a queue of parents desperate to find places for their kids. One parent was seen paying cash to a receptionist and receiving a slip in return. When the SunTeam approached the parent, he said he had paid R480 as there was nothing else he could do. &ldquo;They look at you and charge whatever they feel like. They give you a receipt for R200 and keep the rest of the money,&rdquo; he said.Community leader Sizwe Hlatswayo said: &ldquo;Foreigners pay up to R3 000 and because we don&rsquo;t have the money we are sidelined. It&rsquo;s a no-fee school and they are getting a subsidy from the government. We reported this but nothing has been done.&rdquo; According to parents, the school has been forcing them to pay for the past three years. Councillor Frans Ngomane said: &ldquo;The Sunward district will have a meeting today with parents who paid.&rdquo;Oupa Bodibe, education department spokesman, said the allegations were serious and would be investigated.
