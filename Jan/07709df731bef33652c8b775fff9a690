ARSENAL manager Arsene Wenger brushed off suggestions that his four-match touchline ban for pushing a fourth official was too lenient, saying his critics would not be satisfied even if he was put behind bars.Wenger was slapped with a fine of &pound;25 000 (more than R426 600) for verbally abusing and pushing fourth official Anthony Taylor during Arsenal&rsquo;s Premier League win over Burnley this month.&ldquo;Those who don&rsquo;t like me, any sentence will be too lenient. They would like to put me in jail somewhere without anything in the middle of winter &ndash; and that would still be lenient,&rdquo; he told British media.&ldquo;My reaction (to the ban) is what I said after the game. Let&rsquo;s not bring this situation back again. I do not want to judge what the judge says.&ldquo;I got a sentence and I decided not to appeal, just to get this behind me. There is no need for me to return to that.&rdquo;Wenger watched from the stands as Arsenal thrashed Southampton 5-0 at the St Mary&rsquo;s Stadium on Saturday to advance to the fifth round of the FA Cup.Arsenal, who are second in the table, eight points behind Chelsea after 22 games, host 14th-placed Watford tonight. &ndash; REUTERS
