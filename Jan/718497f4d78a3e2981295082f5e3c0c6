PHODISO Phane says taxis are no longer safe and passengers should be very careful. The woman (32) from Joburg told Daily Sun she was robbed of R4 000 and her expensive cellphone in a taxi on Friday. Phodiso said it happened when she got into a taxi at the Bree Taxi Rank on her way to visit a sick relative in Sandton.&ldquo;When I got into the taxi I was the only one there. While I was waiting, two men came in and sat next to me. &ldquo;One of them put his hands in my pocket and reached for my phone. When I asked him what he was doing, he pulled out a knife and told me to be quiet. &ldquo;He proceeded to search me and took my phone and my wallet, which had my rent money inside. I suspect the taxi driver was working with them. &ldquo;When I rushed out to inform the driver and bystanders what had happened, no one tried to help me. The driver said things like this happen and there was nothing he could do.&rdquo; Phodiso said she might even lose her job because of the robbery. She told the People&rsquo;s Paper that she used her phone for work purposes. &ldquo;I saved some of my work on the phone,&rdquo; said Phodiso.She also feared she would end up homeless, as the money that was stolen was for outstanding and upcoming rent.Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident. He said no arrest has been made. The police are investigating a case of robbery.
