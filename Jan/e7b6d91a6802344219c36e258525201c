&ldquo;A REAL loss indeed!&rdquo; Those were the words of mourners at gogo Alice Jiyane&rsquo;s funeral on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The 103-year-old died at home in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, two days before Christmas after a short illness. For more than 80 years, the gogo was a familiar sight to commuters at Saulsville Station where she sold cooked mealies and nuts. Her health problems started last year after her right leg was injured while she was buying stock in Brits, North West. However, she continued selling to customers even while going in and out of hospital.The gogo&rsquo;s granddaughter, Mavis Jiyane (52), said she was a strong and hard-working woman. &ldquo;She used to wake up early in the morning to go out and sell fruit and vegetables.&rdquo; Her eldest daughter, Alivnah Seabe (79), said she was heartbroken to lose her mum but she was grateful she had such a long life.&ldquo;We were truly blessed to have her around. &ldquo;When we had problems, we ran to her for advice.&rdquo; Alivnah said her mum was a woman of prayer.Another family member said the gogo took after her parents, as her father died at 105 and her mum at 102. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her funeral but to us it&rsquo;s a celebration of the good moments we had with her while she was still alive.&rdquo; Mavis thanked everyone who supported the family during the difficult time. &ldquo;I have no words to express my gratitude to everyone who came through to say goodbye to my gogo at this time of the year.&rdquo; The gogo gave birth to 14 children, seven of whom are still alive. She had 46 grandchildren, 94 great-grandchildren and 50 great-great-grandchildren.
