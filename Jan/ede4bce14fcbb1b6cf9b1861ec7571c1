THE DA-led City of Joburg said it&rsquo;s trying to keep its promise to clean up Jozi.Yesterday city officials raided buildings, cleaned up blocked drains and tried to secure abandoned buildings. They also confiscated pangas, crow bars, guns and knives. &ldquo;The regeneration of the city is one of the things closest to mayor Herman Mashaba&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; said Alen Grobbler, director of the city&rsquo;s social development department.The campaign involved the JMPD, SAPS, Pikitup, social development, Joburg Roads Agency, Joburg Water and environmental affairs.Grobbler said their focus was on displaced or homeless people. &ldquo;We want to find a way to reunite them with their families where possible as well as see what interventions can be made. &ldquo;This operation must be sustainable and continuous. We told ourselves that we must have more commitment if we want to see it succeed.&rdquo; The operation received a thumbs up from passersby who seemed happy to see city officials tackling the now dangerous Jozi. Some of the homeless people were happy at the prospect of the rehabilitation, while others didn&rsquo;t seem to care.Xolani Brook (26), from Orange Farm, said life on the street was difficult.&ldquo;I do this to support my nyaope addiction. I will be happy to go to rehab so I can start life afresh with my family.&rdquo; Integrated service delivery deputy director, Edward Mohale, said their focus was on creating a safe environment for all people on the streets of Jozi. &ldquo;So far we have managed to take in some of the dangerous weapons. We want to change the face of this city.&rdquo;He said they would be working with business people and property owners.
