THE doors of learning have been shut on the class of 2016. Universities say they are full and they will not allow anyone else to come knocking at their doors. Most universities closed registrations last year.Masingita Ringani from Tzaneen in Limpopo said he applied online for a spot at UJ last year but did not get accepted because his grade 11 results did not meet the requirements.He was told in the same email that he would be considered if his matric results met the requirements.&ldquo;My results for grade 12 are good, but I have not heard anything from the university.&rdquo;He said if things did not go well at UJ he would try his luck at Tshwane University of Technology. The Department of Higher Education has recommended that school leavers should also consider FET colleges.Boitumelo Tshetlha said she got four distinctions and wanted to study for a bachelor of science.&ldquo;It will be a waste of time going to a FET college for something I never planned,&rdquo; she said.At the Cape Peninsula University of Technology&rsquo;s Cape Town campus yesterday queues started at reception all the way up to Roeland Street. Some students even slept on the premises to be front in line. Noloyiso Gama (19) from Grabouw said she got up at 4am to get there. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like I will be helped today,&rdquo; she said.Thabo Lakey (21) from Sebokeng was at Vaal University of Techonolgy and said he had been there since 8am. &ldquo;We are not going to finish today. The queues are long and the help from inside takes time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because I want to study I will come back again tomorrow.&rdquo;At the Durban University of Technology, about 10 000 students queued under the scorching sun as they waited to get inside the administration offices.
