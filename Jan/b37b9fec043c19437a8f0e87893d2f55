IF YOU are too shy to consult a sangoma face to face, you can now consult online.A group of young sangomas based in the Eastern Cape have launched a website offering their services.The website, www.umphilisi.co.za, was launched in East London on Tuesday, along with Facebook and Twitter pages.Sangoma Lulama Mphahla, founder of Ithongo Institute of Traditional Healing, believes many of those with the calling are young and educated, and can communicate with their ancestors through social media platforms.Speaking to the SunTeam, Lulama (40) said his new website will make things easier for ancestors, their living relatives and amathwasa.&ldquo;An ancestral calling follows a person until they accept it.&ldquo;This new website will keep amathwasa in touch with their ancestors and gobelas.&rdquo; He said he once avoided his calling.&ldquo;My wife left me and I got involved in many car accidents. &ldquo;My own experiences with my calling inspired me to create this website to help other people who are scared and confused.&rdquo;He said he also assembled traditional herbs which will be packaged in a modern way so people can buy them at pharmacies.Fellow sangoma and Mpahla&rsquo;s associate, Fezekile Futhwa, said the initiatives are not aimed at changing ancestral religion. Instead, they aim to use different platforms to reach young sangomas in training.&ldquo;The website is active. &ldquo;People seek guidance for amasiko, dream analysis and healing, while some want to communicate with their ancestors,&rdquo; said Fezekile.Veteran sangoma gogo Zizinyanya-zama Hlubi Dalasile from Nkontyweni Village, Mthatha said this is spitting in the face of the ancestors.&ldquo;This is just an excuse for people who do not want to answer their ancestral calling. &ldquo;It is dangerous to change old traditions and combine them with Western culture.&rdquo;
