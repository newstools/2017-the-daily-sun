OVER 19 000 children in Gauteng have not yet been placed in schools.“As at 17 January, the total number of unplaced pupils is 19 913 if we combine online applications and walk-ins,” said education MEC Panyaza Lesufi at a media briefing yesterday.Lesufi said last year the department had over 58 000 children who applied online and weren’t placed and that number had been reduced to 7 092 this year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvC9El1Sqa2EwUzAOYRo_k5aZp4ADap6cOwfE1-DYTrbEGgCHKzSQWVOLImiliK8yqCA10WWLVPHfB1gcoLtiLO-aAsPvc7pmvrvnJtQBNEPiCzw15xLj6kctikN15lKCjHLNDvQnA0QJQPyuhHX9QgRQgCTJg7hBxwZWCGTxmYKg7jJ8yL6TTr-QQJDdq7B9D4wf-7r-GSDOg4T7BcofuoywCUdpAum6CJSS4d_84V-7xwikEsGC-4XcM0UmRgrRUnoZzba73n2oX6mSkJbeoeUt1KEXs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJUhc97pYfnvEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He said 12 000 other applications were received by the operations centres after the schools reopened.“The department is prioritising the placement of pupils who applied online and where there is adequate space, parents that have walked in will be accommodated.” Lesufi repeated that they are as concerned as the parents about the children who have not been placed.“We are committed to accelerating placement to eliminate the backlog of online applications. “Unfortunately, for parents who have just walked into our operations centres, this may take a while.”Lesufi said late applications also added to the delay and the department had not declared schools full as districts are still finding space. He said the department received more than 70 000 online applications after the deadline of 1 June last year. Responding to allegations received yesterday that a teacher was dating a grade 8 pupil, Lesufi said: “The affected teacher will be charged with sexual misconduct and if found guilty, will be dismissed and struck off the professional roll of educators.”
