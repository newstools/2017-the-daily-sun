Two families are at war after the death of a one-month-old baby. The tragedy began on Christmas Day in Stanger, KZN. A 15-year-old mother took her baby boy to visit his father&rsquo;s family in Mandeni. But the child died on 27 December &ndash; allegedly one day after one of the Mandeni relatives gave him an enema.The mum&rsquo;s uncle told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are not happy about what happened! After the enema on Monday, the baby slept and something white came out of his nose. On the Tuesday the mum was sent to buy medicine for him. When she returned the family was digging a grave. They told her the baby was dead. But when she went to the shop the baby was alive!&rdquo;He told the People&rsquo;s Paper they want the baby&rsquo;s body to be dug up and re-buried in their own yard.The uncle alleged: &ldquo;I believe he didn&rsquo;t die of natural causes. We don&rsquo;t understand why they insisted on giving him an enema. My niece had told them it was wrong for a one-month-old baby.&rdquo; The angry uncle went on to claim: &ldquo;No cops or paramedics were called to examine the body, and they rushed to bury the baby. When we want answers they become defensive.&rdquo;He told the People&rsquo;s Paper that they are going to ask for permission from the court to dig up the body.The baby&rsquo;s 18-year-old father denied that his child was killed for muthi, as the girl&rsquo;s family allege.&ldquo;The baby died after struggling to breathe properly. We didn&rsquo;t call cops and paramedics because everything happened so quickly and he wasn&rsquo;t on our funeral plan.&rdquo;Recently the KZN MEC of Health, Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo, warned parents about the use of enemas for babies.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokesman, said: &ldquo;The family needs to go to the cop station nearest where the baby was buried to apply for body exhumation. &ldquo;If the court passes the application, the body can be examined to find out if there was foul play associated with the death of the child.&rdquo;
