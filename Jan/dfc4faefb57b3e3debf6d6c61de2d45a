THE ANC stalwarts and veterans who had ruffled the leadership&rsquo;s feathers late last year will be holding a press conference today to report back to signatories and to discuss the way forward. The veterans said they felt a responsibility to ensure the principles and values of the ANC were not destroyed. &ldquo;We believe the overwhelming majority of our citizens embrace the values of the Freedom Charter and the Constitution of our country and share this view,&rdquo; the stalwarts said. The stalwarts will also use the briefing at St George&rsquo;s Anglican Church in Joburg to deliver their take on the ANC&rsquo;s 8 January statement, made at the 105th anniversary of the party at Orlando Stadium, Soweto on Sunday.The stalwarts are signatories to the document &ldquo;For the Sake of our Future&rdquo;, which was presented to Jacob Zuma and the top five leaders of the organisation. The veterans condemned what they called &ldquo;the ill-gotten wealth among some of our leaders at all levels and the resulting ruinous effects on the organisation&rsquo;s moral and political fabric and on society as a whole&rdquo;. The stalwarts are made up of leaders such as Ahmed Kathrada, Andrew Mlangeni and Frank Chikane, Cheryl Carolus, Frene Ginwala and Hoosain Coovadia among others.
