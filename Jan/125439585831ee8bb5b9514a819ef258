LEGENDARY musician, Blondie Makhene, has cast a wide net for help.This as the worried father of four would like Mzansi to help him find his missing daughter, Gontse.Concerned the 29-year-old may be hanging with the wrong crowd, Blondie is afraid Gontse&rsquo;s drug problem may have resurfaced.That&rsquo;s because she is addicted to nyaope and heroin, said the musician, who last saw Gontse at his Tladi, Soweto, home in December.Blondie said his daughter&rsquo;s 14-year battle with substance abuse had taken its toll on his family.&ldquo;Gontse is my special child, who was raised the right way,&rdquo; Blondie said. &ldquo;But the devil has gone out of his way to rob me of her, again.&rdquo;The Baby I&rsquo;m Missing You hitmaker said the last call he got from his daughter this month had given him hope she was still alive.&ldquo;During that call, she asked me for money and told me she was hungry. She said she wanted to buy food and airtime,&rdquo; the musician said.A reluctant Blondie then proceeded to send her the money through FNB&rsquo;s eWallet system.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried my child is living a cheap life in one of the streets in Joburg. I need help to trace her whereabouts so I can find and bring her home,&rdquo; an emotional Blondie said.&ldquo;I love my daughter and want her to come back home. I want to be there for her through this difficult time in her life. I want to help her.&rdquo;The worried dad said Gontse was reluctant to share her contact details during the call.&ldquo;She told me she wanted to come back home. I could hear the desperation in her voice,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;But when I asked her for her contact numbers, she hung up on me.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard, as a parent, not to know your child&rsquo;s wellbeing.&ldquo;Were it not for the support from family and friends, I&rsquo;d probably have lost my mind.&rdquo;
