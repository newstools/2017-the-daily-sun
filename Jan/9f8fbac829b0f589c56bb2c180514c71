TOTTENHAM Hotspur will have revenge in mind when they tackle record-chasing Premier League leaders Chelsea beneath the White Hart Lane floodlights tonight.Chelsea came from behind to win 2-1 when the teams last met in November, but it is last May s 2-2 draw between the London rivals, which ended Spurs title hopes, that will be uppermost in the hosts thoughts.With Chelsea seeking to pull eight points clear at the summit and pursuing a 14th straight win, the boot is now on the other foot. Maybe we will feel how Leicester felt last season, when all the teams were with them and against us, said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino, citing the team who pipped his side to glory last season. Maybe now we are Leicester. Tottenham s 2-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge in November completed a run of one win in 10 matches in all competitions and suggested they would struggle to repeat last season s exploits. But Pochettino s side have rediscovered their rhythm, winning five of their last six league games and scoring 18 goals.They are 10 points behind the leaders, seeking a fifth successive league victory.Sunday s 4-1 win at Watford, which followed a 4-1 success at Southampton, briefly took Spurs into the top four, only for Manchester City to overtake them by beating Burnley on Monday.Dele Alli is the Premier League s form midfielder, having scored five goals in his last three games, and he will not be satisfied with anything but victory against Chelsea. We re in good form and we ve got good confidence, the England midfielder told Spurs website after the New Year s Day victory at Vicarage Road. This is an important win for us and for our mentality going into the next match. Jurgen Klopp, manager of second-place Liverpool, has been doing his utmost to rattle Chelsea by claiming it must be annoying that they have not been able to shake the Merseyside team off.But his words came back to haunt him after Liverpool s 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Monday left Chelsea five points clear. Antonio Conte s side have not failed to win since their 3-0 loss at Arsenal on 24 September.They racked up win number 13 by overcoming Stoke City 4-2 on New Year s Eve, equalling Arsenal s 2002 record for the most consecutive wins within the same Premier League campaign.Victory at Spurs will equal Arsenal s overall record of 14 successive wins, set over two seasons in 2002.
