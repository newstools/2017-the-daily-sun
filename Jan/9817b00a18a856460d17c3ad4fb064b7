TWELVE families have been evacuated from Mshongoville squatter camp in Atteridgeville, west of Pretoria after the ground near their homes caved in.Residents said it happened on Tuesday.They said they heard a woman screaming for help.When they went to check they were shocked to see a huge hole in the ground &ndash; and it kept on getting bigger!Resident Eunice Mashiachidi (27) said people were scared and did not want to sleep in their houses.&ldquo;We slept outside because we were afraid that our shacks would cave in with us inside,&rdquo; she said.On Wednesday morning there was another hole that was even bigger than the one from the previous day.Authorities moved the affected families from the area. Eunice said her house is some distance away from the sinkholes, but she doesn&rsquo;t feel safe in the area anymore.Tshwane municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said the number of people affected had since risen to 45.Some were taken to Mlambo Community Hall in Atteridgeville and others to a safe place in Bremer Street, Pretoria.&ldquo;A team of social workers is working with the families in dealing with the trauma they may be going through,&rdquo; said Bokaba.
