THE EFF has called for the immediate arrest of a Limpopo farmer who they say shot a 23-year-old man in his left leg at Mokwalakwala farm in Duiwelskloof. The farmer allegedly attacked Simon Mmetli on 4 January after he was found carrying four pieces of wood to make a fire, party spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said yesterday.He said Mmetli was transferred to Mankweng Hospital on Thursday where he was set to have the bullet removed from his leg. But the operation was not performed due to his low blood pressure. Ndlozi said: &ldquo;It is atrocious, to say the least, that a young man can be shot in the leg and the police of Modjadjiskloof do absolutely nothing about it.&ldquo;The suspect is roaming the streets of Limpopo as a free man only because he is white and his victim is black. &ldquo;The EFF calls for the immediate arrest of the culprit and for the case to be treated with great urgency.&rdquo;Police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo confirmed the incident and said the farmer and Mmetli had opened cases against each other.&ldquo;The farmer opened a case of theft against the man after he alleged that he stole pieces of a bluegum tree from his farm, and the man opened a case of attempted murder.&ldquo;The case docket was handed to provincial police management so that the contents can be checked.&ldquo;Appropriate action will be taken,&rdquo; Mojapelo said.&ndash; NEWS24
