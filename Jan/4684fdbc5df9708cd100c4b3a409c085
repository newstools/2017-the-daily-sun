Cape Town City striker Lehlohonolo Majoro is hoping to find his best form in the second half of the season after overcoming injury.Majoro suffered an injury against former club Kaizer Chiefs in a league game last November which saw him missing five matches, including the Telkom Knockout final win over SuperSport United.The 30-year-old has scored three goals for his new club - all of them coming in November prior to him being sidelined.The break for the Africa Cup of Nations has, however, given the former AmaZulu and Orlando Pirates marksman more time to regain full fitness, and he says he is raring to go for the second half of the season."It feels good to be back and I pray that there are no injuries in the second-half of the season because I want to play more. I want to be sharp like I was before getting injured," Majoro told&nbsp;SoccerLaduma."I hope I will gel with the team, because you can see they have been performing well and I believe that with hard work and dedication, everything will fall in to place. But, one game at a time."At this point in time we are still busy with mid-season games, and I have been doing well in those mid-season games. Hopefully I will carry those performances into an official game," said the Bafana-capped front-man.City are currently joint top of the standings, behind SuperSport and Bidvest Wits only on goal difference.Their next league match is against Highlands Park on February 7 in Cape Town.
