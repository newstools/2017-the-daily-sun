TRAFFIC came to a standstill as hundreds of angry residents marched to demand the immediate arrest of Mark Scott-Crossley. The march took place in Hoedspruit, Mpumalanga on Friday and was monitored by cops.Protesters from the Welverdiend area of Bushbuckridge handed over a memorandum directed at Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Jimmy Ledwaba at Hoedspruit Police Station. Scott-Crossley has not been arrested although he allegedly deliberately knocked down Silence Mabunda (38) in his car on 14 December.Protest leader Robert Machabe said: &ldquo;What Scott-Crossley did is wrong. We deserve equal treatment whether we are rich or poor, or black or white.&rdquo;Fortune Ndlovu said Mabunda cannot walk properly now.&ldquo;He can no longer provide for his family. Scott-Crossley&rsquo;s lawyer lied when he said he would hand him over to the police.&rdquo;Police spokesman Brigadier Mojalefa Mojapelo said: &ldquo;Scott-Crossley has not handed himself over to the police yet. &ldquo;He is facing a charge of attempted murder.&rdquo;He said Scott-Crossley&rsquo;s lawyer arrived at the Hoedspruit Police Station without the suspect, seeking bail that was not granted. Mabunda was a worker at Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre when he was knocked down on the R36 near Kampersrus.
