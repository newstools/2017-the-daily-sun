SHE is only 12 years old but claims she&rsquo;s been living with a dark secret in her heart. She said she wants to confess to bad things she has done to her family.The girl told Daily Sun it is because she is used for satanic practices by someone living in Ivory Park, Tembisa, Gauteng.The girl, who lives in Sedibeng section, Tembisa, claims she leaves her home in spirit form every night to perform duties as instructed. &ldquo;They took my spirit when I was young. They collect me and tell me what they want. They told me I must do sacrifices as my satanic sisters do.&rdquo;Her uncle said they got suspicious when they saw her putting her feet in cold water every morning and complaining that she was tired.&ldquo;She said she was coming from Kempton Park on foot,&rdquo; said her uncle. I was surprised by this. &ldquo;We all sleep in the house together and I never heard her leaving the house,&rdquo; he said.Her older sister said since she confessed, the young girl has been bumped into by cars on two occasions. &ldquo;She told me twice she was bumped over by a car but was not hurt. I was with her once when it happened. She was bumped into but she was not hurt,&rdquo; said the girl&rsquo;s sister.Pastor Daniel Mogotlane said he had worked with all sorts of satanism issues.&ldquo;I have encountered so many cases of satanism. Each differs from the other. The issue of how demons operate is critical. For each satanistic deed people encounter different unpleasant behaviours. That&rsquo;s why the girl had to put her feet in a bowl to cool them down.&rdquo;
