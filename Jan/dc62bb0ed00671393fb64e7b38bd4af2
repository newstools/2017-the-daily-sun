SEVEN-TIME champions Egypt face Ghana in Port-Gentil tonight (9pm) needing only a point to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations alongside the Black Stars.Egypt can even go through regardless, if Mali fail to beat Uganda in the other Group D match.But a win for the Pharoahs would allow them to leapfrog Ghana and advance as group winners.That might not be what they want, however. The group winners will remain in Port-Gentil for the quarterfinals while the runners-up move to Oyem in the north of the country.An awful pitch in Port-Gentil has had an adverse impact on the quality of the football played there and heavy rain in the city since the weekend will only add to the problem.&ldquo;Everyone wants to play in the other city. No one wants to play at this stadium,&rdquo; Egypt&rsquo;s Ahmed Elmohamady said.&ldquo;But we need to win, we want to win the group. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about getting the points, it&rsquo;s not about the stadium,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;As a striker people expect you to score and I am here to win the trophy. &ndash; BBC
