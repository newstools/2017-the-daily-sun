We’re not doing well but we’re under no pressure at the moment.“We need to stay focused to turn our fortunes around.”Jantjie is aware he won’t walk into the starting lineup, as he will face stiff competition from the likes of Danny Venter, Mbuyiselo Thethani and Tebogo Potsane.“The competition is in the team tough. I’m competing with some of very skilled wingers in the team, but I’m ready for the challenge,” Jantjie said.
