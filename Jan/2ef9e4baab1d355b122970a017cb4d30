Sipho Tyalibongo lives everyday like a man on a knive&rsquo;s edge, for since his wife Weziwe Tyalibongo went missing on Heritage Day 2016, he does not know what news every knock on his door would bring.That fear and desperation to know of Weziwe&rsquo;s fate also rests heavily on the shoulders of their children Mongameli,22, Sihle,20, and young Siphosethu,8.Weziwe&rsquo;s brother Luntu Mene is also a devastated man. Uncertainty seems to run deep in each of them.Mother of three Weziwe Virginia Tyalibongo,46, left their Ilitha Park home on Heritage Day, September 24 2016, saying she was visiting family in Site B.Mene said since her disappearance, they have been to all state hospitals and mortuaries, to no avail.&ldquo;We have satisfied ourselves(that she is not dead), but we are not sure where to look for her now(anymore),&rdquo; he said on Wednesday.Sipho Tyalibongo,59, a teacher at Ilitha Primary School in Gugulethu is clearly devastated and on the verge of a break-down as he relates the &ldquo;mysterious disappearance&rdquo; of his wife.&ldquo;We are having difficult time right now. During Christmas, we were hoping she would surprise us and pop in. Our youngest daughter, Siphosethu keeps on asking me tough questions,&rdquo; he said, battling tears welling up from his eyes.Tyalibongo has visited seers and sangomas in a bid to &ldquo;get to know the whereabouts of my wife&rdquo;.&ldquo;My wife is alive because we visited all the mortuaries and hospitals to no avail, I was accompanied by detectives,&rdquo; he explained.He daughter Sihle said her mother was apparently spotted at the Khayelitsha Mall in December.&ldquo;I met another lady who is a teller at Spar and she was asking about our family and I told her about my missing mother...she seemed surprised and told me she had seen her a few days ago buying stuff at the shop,&rdquo; said Sihle.This is what gave the family hopes that their mother would come back and has intensified their quest to find her.&ldquo;My mother is alive and we appeal to anyone who might know where she is to contact us because we are not coping without her,&rdquo; she said holding tears.Meanwhile The Pink Ladies, a Section 21 Non Governmental Organization that specializes in searches for Missing Persons, both in South African and internationally, has urged families not to &ldquo;wait a long time before reporting a missing person.They work with any individual or organization that has the same objectives and partners with the police in their endeavours.Although the majority of their case loads concern missing children, they also have participated in many adult cases like this one.&ldquo;When reporting a missing person, complete an SAPS Form55 and see that a MPR/OB number is provided as a reference.
