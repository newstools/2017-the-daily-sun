I managed to push it away and started running. They started shooting. I don&rsquo;t know how the bullets missed me.&rdquo; He said he hid under the Umlazi River bridge until cops arrived. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to the Eastern Cape. I will never work in the taxi industry again,&rdquo; he said.The shooting is believed to be over routes between the Durban Liner and Masakhokuhle taxi associations. Durban Liner driver, Mashobane Khumalo (35), who was also at the rank said the taxi with the hitmen was from Masakhokuhle.
