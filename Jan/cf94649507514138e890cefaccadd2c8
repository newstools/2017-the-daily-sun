WHILE most of her friends are furthering their studies, Lerato Mokoena (22) is unable to proceed to university because she shares an ID number with someone else.Even though she passed her matric very well, the young woman from Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni can&rsquo;t continue her studies. &ldquo;My life has been at a complete standstill for almost two years because I don&rsquo;t have an ID. I feel like I don&rsquo;t exist and live like an illegal immigrant in my own country,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;The problem started three years ago when I was doing matric. I lost my ID in a taxi. I went to the department of home affairs to get a new one, but I was told that in the system it showed that I shared an ID with someone in Mpumalanga. They refused to issue me an ID on that basis.&rdquo;Lerato said she was told by officials from Alberton to bring a clinic card proving where she was born and a letter of proof from the school she attended. They also said she had to bring her mother to prove she was born in South Africa.Lerato&rsquo;s mother, Mannuku Mokoena, said: &ldquo;I submitted everything they had asked for from us. &ldquo;But till today she has no ID. Every time I call I&rsquo;m told the system still shows that she shares her ID with someone else. &ldquo;I have applied for her at Unisa and VUT, but she is unable to continue with her studies because of the lack of an ID.&rdquo;Daily Sun contacted Home Affairs spokesman Thabo Mokgola, who said: &ldquo;We will take Lerato&rsquo;s details and investigate what has been causing the delay in issuing her ID. I will refer her problem to the provincial manager who will contact her and try to speed up the process.&rdquo;
