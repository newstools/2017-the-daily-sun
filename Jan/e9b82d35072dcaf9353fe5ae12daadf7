Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri has revealed that chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha has set a target of 40 points for the club this season as they seek to retain their Premier League status.The English champions are currently in 15th place with 21 points, just five clear of the relegation places.The current campaign is far removed from their heroics of last term where they led the standings for much of the season before being crowned league winners with 81 points. At this stage of last season, the Foxes already had 44 points.Ahead of his side's FA Cup clash with Derby on Friday, Ranieri said: "My chairman said 40 points, 40 points please, then after if something happens it's okay - but 40 points."He added: "Of course he is not happy, it is normal, he is the chairman. But he knows very well my ambition, maybe more than him. For me every match is important."While Premier League survival is a priority for the Foxes, they will retain one eye on their Champions League campaign having fared far better in Europe than on the domestic stage.They take on Sevilla in the last 16 of the Champions League next month.And with everything his players have achieved over the past few years, Ranieri has taken a pragmatic approach to where they find themselves now.He concluded: "If you think what these guys have done in the last three years it is amazing. They won the title in the Championship, they fight a lot to avoid relegation and then won the (Premier League) title. The three years has been very busy in the mind."
