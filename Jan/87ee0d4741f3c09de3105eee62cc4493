BOURNEMOUTH striker Benik Afobe has pulled out of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finals to stay with his Premier League team despite recently switching his allegiance from England to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Congolese Football Federation has confirmed Afobe&rsquo;s withdrawal from a 31-man preliminary squad, who have gathered in Yaounde, Cameroon, for pre-tournament preparations.&ldquo;Afobe has forfeited the tournament,&rdquo; said media officer Gerard-Desire Angengwa without offering any reason.British media reported that Afobe had told the Congolese coach Florent Ibenge he wished to consolidate his place in the Bournemouth starting lineup after scoring against Swansea City in a 3-0 away win on Saturday.&ldquo;The manager showed faith by starting me and I wanted to repay him with a goal, so I&rsquo;m happy,&rdquo; the 23-year-old told his club&rsquo;s website (www.afcb.co.uk) after the victory on New Year&rsquo;s Eve. &ldquo;The goal was a great relief and came at a crucial time. The lads have been helping me a lot and I want to improve personally.&rdquo;Afobe now has two goals in his last three starts for the Cherries but could be banned from playing for his club for the duration of the three-week tournament that starts on 14 January, should the Congolese federation take up the issue with Fifa.Afobe&rsquo;s decision comes less than two months after receiving Fifa&rsquo;s permission belatedly to switch his international allegiance. He played for England at Under-21 level previously.He was supposed to debut for the Congolese in November&rsquo;s World Cup qualifier against Guinea but was blocked when the FA sent his paperwork for the switch of nationality to the wrong federation, embarrassingly mixing up DR Congo with neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville.DR Congo have a tough group at the tournament in Gabon, competing with holders Ivory Coast, Morocco and Togo in Group C. Their opening game is against Morocco in Oyem on 16 January. &ndash; REUTERS
