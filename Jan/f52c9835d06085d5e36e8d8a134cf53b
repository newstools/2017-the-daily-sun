HOME Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has promised to come down hard on businesses and companies who hire many immigrants and exploit them.He said those that didn&rsquo;t adhere to immigration laws would face hefty fines.Gigaba said many restaurants and hotels preferred to hire immigrants over South African citizens, while the law stipulated that all businesses and companies should hire at least 60% South African nationals.Gigaba spoke during a briefing at Home Affairs&rsquo; head office in Tshwane yesterday. &ldquo;This practice sees businesses exploit migrants through lower wages and working conditions, which is irresponsible, immoral and illegal.&ldquo;It has also led to heightened social tensions in communities between South Africans and migrants, and can only cause harm.&rdquo; He also urged Basotho people who were still living in Mzansi illegally to get their documents in order.&ldquo;Basotho who produced Lesotho ID cards or birth certificates when applying, without valid passports, and still with outstanding documents, must provide all supporting documents before 31 March.&rdquo;He said some 100 000 Lesotho nationals applied for special permits last year.&ldquo;The total number of online applications submitted at Visa Facilitation Service (VFS) was 127 048. By the closing date, 88 563 Basotho nationals had completed the application process.&rdquo; He said the focus was now on settlement and processing of the completed applications. Gigaba said those who had not completed the application process by 31 March would be deported.&ldquo;We had a clear understanding with the Lesotho officials about this matter.&rdquo; He said 31 019 permits had so far been collected. &ldquo;Applicants who have not yet collected theirs must phone the VFS call-centre to check and collect the permits.&rdquo;
