BONGANI Maziya was already angry when he learned that his daughter had 119 classmates.But when the 33-year-old heard that the 120 primary school kids were crammed together in steel containers without proper ventilation, he and other parents shut the school down last week!Bongani told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The containers are very hot and the kids were sweating non-stop. I immediately called the other parents and we decided to shut the school down before our kids suffocate.&rdquo;Bongani&rsquo;s daughter is one of 120 pupils enrolled at Mhlaba Primary School in Bosfontein, near Malelane in Mpumalanga. He said the problem began when the primary school merged with Langa Secondary School, which meant that the little kids had to vacate their brick classrooms to make way for the older newcomers. They were put in the tiny steel containers without windows.&ldquo;I knew that my daughter suddenly had 119 classmates, but I did not expect that our kids would be made to vacate their comfortable classrooms. I also cannot understand how teaching and learning could occur in such a small, crowded space,&rdquo; he added.Another parent, Nikiwe Maziya (37), said: &ldquo;We had the same overcrowding problem last year with 80 pupils, and the department promised that they would fix the problem. We were told the secondary school would only squat at the primary school for three months, but it is now 2017 and nothing has been done. Instead, it is our kids who are now squatters in their own school.&rdquo; Spokesman for the Mpumalanga Department of Education Jasper Zwane said they are working on solving the problem.&ldquo;I am sure by the end of the week, the secondary school would have moved to new premises,&rdquo; he said.
