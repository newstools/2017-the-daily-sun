&ldquo;WHY did they shoot at my husband when he was not a threat?&rdquo; This was the question asked by Barbara Fortuin (47) after her husband was allegedly shot by cops on Wednesday with four rubber bullets by the cops . Her husband, Alfred Ngwato (55), was injured during a protest in Mmakau, North West. Alfred claimed the trouble started when he went to ask cops why they were arresting his daughter.He said his daughter was among protesting residents who blocked Molefe Makinta Highway to demand better service delivery. &ldquo;When I asked what was going on, they started swearing at me. &ldquo;We exchanged words and I heard one of them shouting &lsquo;shoot him!&rsquo;&ldquo;Before I knew it, two bullets hit my bum,&rdquo; claimed Alfred. He ran to a house near the highway but said cops ordered him into their Toyota Quantum. &ldquo;They were ordering me around in a disrespectful manner and I told them to treat me with respect. &ldquo;I turned away from them and they fired another two shots at me, hitting me on the right arm.&rdquo;Barbara said the cops then drove off to the police station with her husband. This angered residents, who gathered outside the cop shop and demanded that they take Alfred to the nearest hospital. They camped outside until Barbara was eventually allowed to take Alfred for treatment. &ldquo;He was taken to Brits Hospital, where he was treated and discharged. &ldquo;How can you keep an injured person in the cells?&rdquo; said Barbara. North West police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said a case of assault has been opened.&ldquo;The police have opened a case of assault against Ngwato and the matter is still under investigation.&rdquo;
