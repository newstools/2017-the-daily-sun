Title hopefuls Arsenal will no doubt be favourites when they travel to Wales to face a struggling Swansea City in Saturday's English Premier League clash.With new Swans boss Paul Clement taking charge of his first match at home, it's clear that he understands he has to keep his best players if the side are to avoid the drop in 2016/17.The 45-year-old told reporters: "You need to keep your best players and Gylfi and Fernando are two of the best players the team has got."You'd possibly expect interest in them, but they're signed and contracted here and I want to keep them."Meanwhile, Arsene Wenger has revealed that the influential but at times temperamental Mesut Ozil is still deciding on his future.The attacking midfielder has been quiet of late, but could feature against the Swans.Wenger revealed that his own future at Arsenal was a part of the player's thinking, saying: "He would like to know what happens on the managerial front of course, but I don't think that's the main part of his decision."In team news, Swansea will be without new signing Luciano Narsingh, who has a calf strain.Defender Neil Taylor misses out after fracturing his cheekbone in training. Stephen Kingsley or Angel Rangel will likely deputise for the player.&nbsp;For the visitors, Theo Walcott remains out with a knock and the club expect him to be sidelined for a further two weeks at least.Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin are also unavailable for the Gunners. Santi Cazorla remains a long-term casualty with an ankle injury.
