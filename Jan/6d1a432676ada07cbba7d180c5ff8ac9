MOROCCO coach Herve Renard says there are better teams than his in the Africa Cup of Nations quarterfinals.Renard guided his team to the last eight with a 1-0 win over Ivory Coast, the team he led to the 2015 title.He said: &ldquo;I was very lucky to work with Ivory Coast and we share the same spirit. But now I have to continue and try to take Morocco far.&ldquo;We are not favourites to win the tournament, there are better teams than us. But we are still in it.&rdquo;The Frenchman is going for an unprecedented third title with a third national team, having also lifted the trophy with Zambia in 2012.But he was cautious after Tuesday&rsquo;s win over the Ivorians and suggested the shocking pitch at Stade de Oyem was a contributing factor to their success.&ldquo;I feel very good and give congratulations to the players. They did very well tactically, they didn&rsquo;t do very well technically &ndash; but the pitch is very difficult.&ldquo;Today we beat the Ivory Coast on a bad pitch that proved to be a leveller. But at the end when you win the game 1-0 against the African champions, you are very happy.&rdquo;He also revealed that he gave his team a harsh reality check at the interval, even though they appeared comfortable in holding the Ivorians at 0-0 &ndash; a scoreline that would have put the Atlas Lions through.&ldquo;I told my team at half-time that if we continued to play the way we were playing then, we would go out. It was not good enough in the first half,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We were scared of facing the Ivory Coast and when you are scared of your opponents, you cannot achieve anything.&rdquo;Morocco remained defensively resolute after the break but also carried more of a threat going forward. Substitute Rachid Alioui then struck a spectacular winner from long range in the 64th minute.Assistant coach Mustapha Hadji revealed the Morocco bench &ldquo;had a feeling&rdquo; Alioui could have a decisive influence.&ldquo;It was a great goal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Football can be magic, sometimes you have a feeling and you don&rsquo;t know why, but it worked for us and it was great.&rdquo;Morocco will play the winners of Group D, to be decided last night, in the quarterfinals at the Stade de Port-Gentil on Sunday. Renard just wants his players to be prepared: &ldquo;Now a new competition begins with the knockout matches, and we will need a winning mentality.&rdquo;
