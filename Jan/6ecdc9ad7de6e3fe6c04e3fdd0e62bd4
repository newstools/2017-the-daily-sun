THE BAREKNUCKLE champ of Venda has retired. It&rsquo;s because the musangwe championship fights, held at Gaba outside Thohoyandou, were a bit of a flop on New Year&rsquo;s Day.Nobody stepped up to challenge the reigning champion, Khodani Nephalama (24), who is also known as Cina in Vhembe boxing circles.The tournament started some three weeks ago and pulled in large crowds in the Vhembe region over the festive season.Boxers don&rsquo;t fight for prizes, but for personal glory and pride. Champions are highly esteemed in their own villages.This year, amateurs took to the ring but none of the expected big fighters were bold enough to challenge the reigning champ, Cina. Cina, from neighbouring Mukula village, is a student at Vhembe TVET College. He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve held the title for quite some time now. But it&rsquo;s now time to call it quits and give others a chance.&rdquo;The president of musangwe in Vhembe, Poison Ndevana, said: &ldquo;We had thought that we&rsquo;d get a new champion this year, but our expectations did not materialise.&ldquo;The boxers are dead scared of Cina so he decided to give up his title without a fight as there was no one to challenge him.&ldquo;We are doing our best to develop community boxing and we have managed to produce top flight professional boxers like Thuso Mulovhedzi. &ldquo;We also managed to keep the youngsters from the streets during the festive season. And even people from outside South Africa visit for this tournament.&ldquo;We will continue in the new year and organise it better than the current series of fights.&rdquo;The bare-knuckle musangwe tournament is said to have started more than a century ago and while the tournament does not permit female spectators, boxers as young as nine years old are allowed to take part.
