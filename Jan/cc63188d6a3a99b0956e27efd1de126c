EVERY morning they wake up to a very bad smell, allegedly coming from an abandoned container in their neighbour’s yard.Now, some residents from D Section, in KwaMashu, north of Durban claim they are forced to close their windows and doors to keep the stench away. A resident said a neighbour bought a big empty container last October.“We woke up and found this hugecontainer on our neighbour’s yard. But we were shocked by the terrible smell coming from it. The smell has become worse. And now I suffer from a headache.” if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstO6Z-Kvw7UMYFCwPjdeJzlIMa5XZ3cLWHZkOpjjdzpzZUUQs6pAA2aeT3wIi-pHtb-xFFovWBck8pJmi3RXFMLesaA1YbbR4trFApxJg06kMPJH258T0HziLfQKd2FFrkIztcxJnX7naRbGNBv0Wc7wwgJdjDRPSLrNQlBKyXo2bSdgyfSk_TflPK1PP9e4b4LGBTn5Z6WK46eXK5M_f7qSmW7BLUe8Ad34vnlAnip8HXhGAJAVC159H_mSi5CERTOwwAd31tU64qPAfJC3p7ORdqLSlA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzOTcBJfuf7aVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It doesn’t bother heras she doesn’t live in the house. We want it removed as it will affect the value of our houses. She doesn’t care about our health and safety. It’s now a thugs’ hideout.” Another resident said they wrote a petition to their ward councillor. The SunTeam couldn’t speak to the house owner since she was in hospital. A family member, Cindy Gumede, said they are unaware of the residents’ concerns. The house owner is currently in hospital but as her family we were not aware of the residents’ concerns. “I’ll tell the owner’s kids. But neighbours can’t tell the owner what she must or mustn’t do in her yard.” Councillor Mamane Xulu said she is aware of the matter and she saw the petition. “I went to look for the woman, but I could not find her. I will find out from my superiors what to do regarding the matter.”
