INMATES at St Albans prison in Port Elizabeth have embarked on a hunger strike in protest against management.According to a prisoner they are protesting because prison management has ignored their pleas for better treatment. They also want the suspension of officials involved in an incident which led to the death of three inmates a week ago. More than 30 people, including both inmates and warders, were injured on 26 December. The inmates had been armed with sharp objects and self-made knives.&ldquo;We were shocked to see the warders who were allegedly involved in the clash with our fellow inmates back at work the next day. &ldquo;We are still saying that we want enough time to exercise. Now we are using a hunger strike as a means to get management&rsquo;s attention. We will continue to starve ourselves until we get proper answers from them,&rdquo; said the prisoner.Nkosinathi Breakfast, Eastern Cape Correctional Services regional commissioner, confirmed that some of the officials who were on duty that day are back at work. He added that investigations are still on.&ldquo;This is not a hunger strike. It is just that offenders have not been eating food prepared by us since Tuesday. &ldquo;But most are eating stock brought in by their families and friends while some are buying from the shop,&rdquo; he said. Breakfast said on New Year&rsquo;s Day only 19 offenders out of 1 644 refused to eat food from Correctional Service suppliers.&ldquo;The situation still remains tense but under control. The lockdown has been relaxed and offenders in other sections of the prison are allowed to get visitors and make phone calls. A lockdown is still applicable at Maximum B unit.&rdquo;
