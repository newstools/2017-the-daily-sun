ZIMBABWEZIMBABWEAN courts will from today begin the prosecution of more than 100 critics of President Robert Mugabe following a wave of protests last year.Among these are opposition politicians, church leaders, human rights activists and vendors that participated in the demonstrations against the worsening wave of economic and political problems.The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights will represent most of the activists in the charges it argues are trumped up.First to stand trial will be Movement for Democratic Change legislators Ronia Bunjira and Fani Munengami, both of the capital Harare.They will appear alongside some residents also arrested in September for allegedly participating in protests over the government&rsquo;s refusal to implement electoral reforms demanded by a coalition of opposition political parties.Others to face prosecution include vendors Larry Chasamba, Patrick Chifamba, Tendai Kagodora, Stendrick Zvorwadza and Winnety Mubaiwa, who protested against the worsening socio-economic meltdown in the country.Renowned pastor Patrick Mugadza of the Remnant Church in northern Kariba is among outspoken clergyman of the Mugabe regime, alongside pastor Evan Mawarire who has since fled the country after courts cleared him of criminal charges emanating from the protests. &ndash; CAJ NEWS
