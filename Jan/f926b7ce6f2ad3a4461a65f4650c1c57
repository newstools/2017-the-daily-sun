BAROKA FC new head coach, Jacob &ldquo;Cellular&rdquo; Sakala, says he has a special strategy to save Bakgaga from sinking deeper into the relegation zone in the Absa Premiership.Sakala will be put to a test for the first time on 7 February when the Premier Soccer League (PSL) second round kicks off.Bakgaga visit Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Cellular replaced Kgoloko &ldquo;The Dreamer&rdquo; Thobejane, who will now be the assistant coach after a dismal first round.After 15 games of the first round the Limpopo-based team managed to gather 12 points, which saw them going into the break sitting at the foot of the table.The well-travelled Sakala told SunSport Baroka will be a better team in the second round, but at the moment he&rsquo;s working hard to improve the defence as the team struggled in the first round.Said Sakala: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the team. What I&rsquo;ve realised is they lacked confidence.&ldquo;But All that will soon change in the second round. We&rsquo;re going to be more competitive and organised in defence.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident this team won&rsquo;t be relegated at the end of the season. My mandate from management is to make sure the team stays in the PSL.&ldquo;But with the type of players I have we will finish in the top eight.&rdquo;With the January transfer window period, which runs until Tuesday night, Bakgaga have added seven players: Mxolisi Kunene, Sindo Letsoalo, Jose Garcia, Siphamandla Sangweni, Helder Pelembe, Tshinuna Abashoni and Ayanda Dlamini.Last weekend, the team participated in a preseason tournament &ndash; the Mbombela Spectacular Cup &ndash; and played against Bidvest Wits.Sakala said he was impressed with their level of fitness but there are some areas of concern.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m impressed with the friendlies I&rsquo;ve played so far. &ldquo;The pool of players I have will be enough. &ldquo;So, I won&rsquo;t be making any signings. Some players are still a work in progress, they&rsquo;re not fit enough, but we&rsquo;re ready for the second round,&rdquo; concluded Sakala.
