THANDI Monne (33) and her seven-year-old son Bophelo were last seen on Christmas Eve.&nbsp; Thandi drove away from her mum&rsquo;s home in Sasolburg, Free State with Bophelo in her silver gray VW Polo Vivo and the two have not been seen since.&nbsp; According to her family, her phone is off and she is not at her apartment in Zamdela. Thandi&rsquo;s mum, Daphne Chabangu (52), said her daughter lived with her boyfriend, but they can&rsquo;t get hold of him either.&nbsp; Daphne said: &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t reach her on Christmas Eve so we went to look for her. Her landlord said they realised before Christmas that Thandi had left without giving notice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mum said they called Thandi&rsquo;s friends and other relatives, but nobody knew where she was.&nbsp; &ldquo;We informed the cops about her disappearance, as her car is also missing. The cops searched for her at her friend&rsquo;s house, but she wasn&rsquo;t there. We finally opened a missing persons&rsquo; case last week,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; The registration number of Thandi&rsquo;s Polo is FNX 089 FS.&nbsp; Police spokeswoman Lieutenant Livhuhani Hani said two missing persons&rsquo; cases have been opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyone who knows the whereabouts of Thandi and her son can should contact Constable Ntsoaki Phehlukwayo on 079 5351 123 or at 016 974 6067.&rdquo;&nbsp;
