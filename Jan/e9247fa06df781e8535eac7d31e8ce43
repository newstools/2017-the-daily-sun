BLOEMFONTEIN CELTIC MultiChoice Diski Challenge captain, Shadrack Kobedi, has made a firm decision to do everything they can to win this year&rsquo;s championship.On-form Celtic will host unpredictable Kaizer Chiefs at Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium in Bloemfontein today (2pm).They will be hoping to continue where they left off last weekend when they walloped their fellow mates Free State Stars 6-0 in Daveyton.A win for them will widen the gap tight between them and log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns.Author Ernest Agyemang once said: &ldquo;If you have not seen the real end of the journey, don&rsquo;t boast much at the beginning, keep the real end in mind and mind how to end it successfully.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s what Celtic did. They have not done their best in the MDC for the past two spells, but this season they made a U-turn, proving they&rsquo;ve been investing on something.Celtic have taken the 2016/2017 season by storm, winning seven out of the 10 games they&rsquo;ve played. They&rsquo;re on the verge of winning the Diski Challenge for the first time.Captain Kobedi believes it&rsquo;s possible to win the title, but it&rsquo;s not in their hands at the moment.Said Kobedi: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working hard and encouraging each other. As a team, we want to make sure we win all our games, while hoping Sundowns drop points.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hungry for it. Early in the season we set goals and we&rsquo;re on the right track.&rdquo;Other fixtures for today:Bidvest Wits vs SuperSport United (Sturrock Park 10am)) Golden Arrows v Free State Stars (Dr Molemela Stadium 12pm)) Platinum Stars vs Polokwane City (Royal Bafokeng 12pm)) Baroka FC vs Highlands Park (Peter Mokaba 12pm).
