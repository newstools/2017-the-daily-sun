IT SEEMS there are many men who have a problem with sleepy or small 4-5s. Ever since Daily Sun published sangoma Mandla Zulu&rsquo;s story about his imbiza that helps men get an erection on Wednesday, the paper has been flooded with calls and emails from desperate men across Mzansi.Zulu (38) also told the SunTeam that men have visited him at home in Folweni, and at his stall in Isipingo, KZN. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just surprised that there are so many men who have the same problem. &ldquo;As we speak, there are men in my house who are waiting for me to help them after reading the story.&rdquo; Zulu said about his imbiza: &ldquo;Some come to me saying their wives are leaving them. Instead of feeling sorry for them, I just laugh because it&rsquo;s easy to fix their problem.&rdquo; He claimed his ancestors helped him mix the imbiza.The People&rsquo;s Paper&rsquo;s KZN office was also flooded with calls from men with weak 4-5s. Some even asked for directions to Zulu&rsquo;s house.A caller said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been silently suffering from this thing. My girlfriends are leaving me after having sex because they complain of my sleepy 4-5. I have tried to get help from doctors but had no luck.&ldquo;Please help me with Zulu&rsquo;s contact number. His imbiza is my only hope.&rdquo; Some men also sent emails to Daily Sun. One email read: &ldquo;Dear Reggy, I just saw an article today by Mavi Ngcobo headlined: Strong imbiza made for men! I&rsquo;d like to know if Mavi perhaps has this guy&rsquo;s number so I can request directions to his place for assistance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate your assistance, Reggy, as I am one of these men who suffer from this shame (small penis).&rdquo;
