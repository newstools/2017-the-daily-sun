A MAN had to borrow money to see a private doctor after a government nurse apparently accused him of being drunk.Last Wednesday, Chris Calvery (48), who is TB patient from CC Lloyd, East London in the Eastern Cape had a painful stomach. He decided to go to Duncan Village Day Hospital for treatment.Chris claimed he was shocked when the nurse shouted at him and accused him of being drunk instead of treating him.Chris told Daily Sun that he was very disappointed and embarrassed in front of the other patients. &ldquo;I told the nurse that I was not drunk but she kept insisting that I was. I have not alcohol since I started the TB treatment and have gone six months now without drinking booze.&rdquo; Chris was in great pain that day and decided to leave the hospital without being helped. He went home and told his mother what had happened. &ldquo;My mother had to borrow money so I could see a private doctor. That is when I was helped.&rdquo;Chris said he wants the Department of Health to do something about the nurse. &ldquo;She deals with the public so it is very bad for her to behave like that. Why did she choose to work there if she cannot behave?&rdquo;Sizwe Kupelo, the Eastern Cape Health spokesman, told Daily Sun that every person has a right to be seen by a professional nurse or doctor. &ldquo;Everyone has a right to be treated no matter what the situation is. We condemn such behaviour. We will take disciplinary action once we investigate the allegations.&rdquo;
