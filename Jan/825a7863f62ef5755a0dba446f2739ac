CAPE Town City head coach Eric Tinkler believes his side will be serious contenders for the Absa Premiership title &ndash; if they can duplicate their first round efforts.City, under the former Orlando Pirates mentor, surprised everyone when they won the Telkom Knockout and finished joint top of the league with SuperSport United and Bidvest Wits at the end of the first round.All three clubs ended 2016 on 25 points but both the Clever Boys and Matsatsantsa a Pitori have matches in hand going into the second round, which resumes on 7 February.Said Tinkler: &ldquo;I reckon we can go all the way if we apply ourselves in the same way we did in the first round and show consistency. I see Wits, SuperSport and defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns as the other realistic challengers. But it is a tight league and we have to build on the first round.&rdquo;Tinkler said he was also focused on winning the Nedbank Cup: &ldquo;We have two trophies still to play for in what will be a tough second round.&rdquo;Tinkler said the fact that Downs, Wits and United all had Caf commitments could help City, who as a newly formed club will not be playing in any African competitions.The coach, who led Orlando Pirates to the final of the Caf Confederation Cup in 2015, added: &ldquo;Playing in Africa may or may not affect our three main rivals. Time will tell.&rdquo;He admitted the players had exceeded expectations after businessman John Comitis bought MP Black Aces&rsquo; franchise and formed CT City in July: &ldquo;We achieved well above expectations by winning the TKO and finishing high up in the league. But we still have work to do and keep building the squad.&rdquo;Tinkler said he had been working hard on weaknesses that surfaced in the first round.The former Bafana Bafana midfield star explained: &ldquo;We are strong in attack. But we gave away far too many goals from set-pieces in the first round. That&rsquo;s an area I&rsquo;ve been working on during the break.&rdquo;Tinkler also stated that he would boost his squad in the January transfer window: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m negotiating to bring in three new players to strengthen the squad.&rdquo;
