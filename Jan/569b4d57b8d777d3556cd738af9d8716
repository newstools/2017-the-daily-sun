LIKE a herder swinging his stick, the cop waved his keys and whistled while taking two alleged offenders to the holding cells. He had no idea that soon he would be calling for help.The two men punched him and forced him to the ground, taking his keys and locking him in the cell. Then they released six more detainees from other cells and made their escape. Sources at Durban Central Police Station said the two criminals were handed over to the officer on Sunday morning by an investigating officer.He had just finished laying charges against them in the charge office.&ldquo;The victim was supposed to take the offenders to the cells,&rdquo; said a source. &ldquo;But the two beat him and took the keys.&ldquo;After shoving him into a cell, they used the keys to open other cells, setting six of their fellow detainees free. &ldquo;On their departure, they bumped into another officer who recognised them and called other cops.&rdquo;He said the police chased after the criminals but only three of the eight were re-arrested. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed that a case of escaping from police holding cells has been opened against the men.He said full details were not available as they were still waiting for a report from Durban Central.&ldquo;No information is yet available on the escapees&rsquo; offences or how long had they had been in the cells.&rdquo; Last year, police officers Bhekizitha Gumede and Siza Nyandeni were shot dead by two detained prisoners.The inmates were escaping from the holding cells at Nyoni Police Station in Mandeni and overpowered two cops.
