RESIDENTS, family members, teachers and classmates struggled to hold back their tears when they said their last goodbyes to little Danisile Mnisi on Friday.The 11-year-old who died after being set alight by her mother&rsquo;s lover was buried on Friday at Loftus Gardens Cemetery near Atteridgeville. At the time of her attack, she was sleeping with her two siblings in the four-roomed shack in Mshongoville, outside Attridgeville in Tshwane when their mother&rsquo;s lover came looking for her.Their mother was not home at the time and that angered her lover.He allegedly attacked Danisile by putting her feet on a hotplate, stabbed her at the back, poured petrol on her and set her alight in front of her two siblings.She was hospitalised for nine months and showed signs of recovery.She was even allowed to visit her family for the Christmas holidays and spent the first day of school with her classmates at the hospital.She was a grade six pupil at Bud Mbelle Primary School.But death took her last Thursday at Kalafong Hospital.Her devastated family members said they had hoped she would recover.Danisile&rsquo;s teacher, Sir Maja described her as a respectful child who liked to play with other kids.&ldquo;She was very responsible when it came to doing her school work, and not having her in my class after she was admitted left a big void.&rdquo; He said he used to visit her at the hospital and she was always asking about other kids in the classroom.Her grandmother, Zanele Mnisi (46), said that it is very painful to bury her granddaughter at such a young age.&ldquo;I never thought someone would be so heartless and burn such a young girl for something that she doesn&rsquo;t even know,&rdquo; she said. One of the family members told Daily Sun that challenges come in various ways.
