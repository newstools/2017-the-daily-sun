FREE Education!This was the call from EFF leader Julius Malema and hundreds of his supporters yesterday at Westville Correctional Services.Malema visited the prison in support of jailed Durban University of Technology student activist Education Khanyile (27). Addressing about 500 EFF members at the prison west of Durban, Malema said the party was proud of Education, who was arrested in September during a Fees Must Fall protest.Malema was accompanied by EFF national spokesman, Floyd Shivambu, as well as national chairman Dali Mpofu and member of Parliament, Makoti Khawula.Outside the prison, EFF members and students sang struggle songs, demanding that Education be freed.Education is accused of using a slingshot during a protest and is facing charges of public violence, illegal gathering and inciting violence. He has applied for bail several times with no luck. His last attempt was on 22 December at the Pietermaritzburg High Court. He is expected to make his next court appearance on 19 January.Phumzile Khathini, Education&rsquo;s mum, was too emotional to speak to the media. After Malema was done, EFF bodyguards whisked her away from the prison.
