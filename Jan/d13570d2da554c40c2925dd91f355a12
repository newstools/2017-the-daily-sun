DRUNK drivers are among the main killers on Mzansi roads.&nbsp; But cooking while drunk can be just as dangerous!&nbsp; Residents of Masiphumelele kasi outside Fish Hoek in Cape Town were left homeless and fuming after another shack fire started when a cooking stove was left unattended, allegedly by a drunk man.&nbsp; The 25-year-old &ndash; known only as Farai &ndash; died as he tried to escape the fire that started in his shack.&nbsp; The dead man was allegedly cooking and left the stove unattended.&nbsp; &ldquo;The same thing happened last year. A person cooked, fell asleep and died in the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t surprised when we heard that is how the fire started. They go out drinking all night and come back and cook. They do not seem to learn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s resting in peace and those who are left behind have to start from scratch all over again,&rdquo; said one resident who didn&rsquo;t want to be named.&nbsp; She lost all her belongings in the fire while 20 more people were left homeless after the fire ripped through their shacks on Saturday morning.&nbsp; Fire victim Agnes Moyo (30) said: &ldquo;It was about 7am when I saw smoke coming in from the outside.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rushed outside and saw the shack right behind mine was on fire. The fire was huge and close. I ran for my life and couldn&rsquo;t save a thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Firefighters were quick to respond. It is sad that someone lost his life,&rdquo; said Agnes.&nbsp; Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;An inquest case docket has been registered,&rdquo; said Traut.&nbsp;
