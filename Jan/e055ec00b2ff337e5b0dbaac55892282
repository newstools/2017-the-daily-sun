SHE heard his voice on the phone. But what he said froze Thandi Masina&rsquo;s heart . . . She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;He laughed at me and told me he&rsquo;d killed my daughter.&rdquo;Thandi Masina (45) from Winterveld, near Mabopane, north of Tshwane, sobbed as she recalled the cruel words.Her only child, Brenda Masango (30), was found strangled last week Tuesday. Her body lay in her lover&rsquo;s house, next to a bucket full of water and a gun. Thandi said: &ldquo;Before Brenda left I was angry because she didn&rsquo;t say where she was going. And she took the money we were supposed to use for meat at Christmas.&rdquo; Thandi said on Christmas Day Brenda called her. But she ignored the call because she was still angry. &ldquo;Brenda sent me an SMS with a good message and an apology,&rdquo; she said. But again she ignored it . . . until she got a call last week Tuesday morning that Brenda needed her help.Thandi called back and spoke to the suspect &ndash; who is now in custody. Then he allegedly broke the spine-chilling news.When she rushed to his house she found community members and cops already there. Brenda was lying lifeless on the floor.&ldquo;At first I thought she was shot but there was no blood. Then I was told he&rsquo;d strangled her,&rdquo; she said.According to Thandi, Brenda had dropped off her three kids for the holidays with a relative in Bronkhorstspruit.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to tell them. They were very close to their mother.&rdquo;Loate police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of murder was opened. &ldquo;He handed himself over and will appear in court soon.&rdquo;
