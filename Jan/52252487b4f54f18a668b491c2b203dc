I noticed semen in her underwear and I asked her what was wrong, but she did not want to speak. &ldquo;I rushed her to the clinic where the nurses told me my daughter had been raped,&rdquo; said the mum.She told the People&rsquo;s Paper her daughter said the suspect had showed her a pot of meat boiling on the stove and said he would chop her into pieces and boil her like the meat if she said anything.&ldquo;My daughter is currently on ARV medication. &ldquo;Who on earth does such a painful thing to an innocent child? He should be removed from society.&rdquo;KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident and said a case was opened at Sydenham Police Station.&ldquo;We confirm the incident where a seven-year-old girl allegedly was raped by her neighbour. The suspect was arrested on Wednesday.&rdquo; Magistrate Bonisile Ngcobo remanded the case for a formal bail application to Monday. &ldquo;The suspect will remain in custody,&rdquo; said Ngcobo.
