TEACHING at some schools in Vuwani, Limpopo was suspended yesterday as residents supported 33 suspects who were arrested last year for burning 30 schools.Pro Makhado spokesman Nsovo Sambo told Daily Sun they did this in solidarity with those arrested. He said things would go back to normal today.Many people gathered outside the Vuwani Magistrates Court yesterday.Some residents protested last year about the decision to include their area in the new Lim 345 Municipality.Thirty schools were burned by unhappy residents throughout last year.Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said 27 of the suspects who were arrested had their cases withdrawn by the magistrate.&ldquo;The other six remain behind bars and will appear in court again on 21 April.&rdquo;Residents of Tshikikinini and Mamvuka in Nzhelele, Limpopo torched a local primary school, a water affairs office and a post office yesterday.They reacted to an announcement by mayor Shonisani Sinyosi of the Makhado Municipality that the tarring of the 16,5km gravel road in the area would be done in phases.The road from Nzhelele that connects the N1 to Makhado and Musina was blocked with burning tyres and other objects. Pupils at some schools were forced to go home. A protester said it&rsquo;s better if authorities just tar the full road at once.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t entertain the phases,&rdquo; he said.Municipal spokesman Louis Bobodi said they don&rsquo;t have enough resources to tar the road all at once.&ldquo;We understand the people&rsquo;s call that the road mustn&rsquo;t be done in phases. &ldquo;We humbly plead with residents to stop protesting and give us a chance to continue with the process.&rdquo;Mojapelo said the police have opened cases of public violence and arson but no arrests have been made.
