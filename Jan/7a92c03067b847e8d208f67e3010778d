ACCORDING to Mmalekgwara Kau, she is the rightful chief of the Batlhako Ba Matutu. The gogo (89) said before she dies, she wants the report of the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims&rsquo; 2014 investigation into the matter to be released by the North West government. Mmalekgwara was the eldest child of Chief Moganetsi Mabe from Mabieskraal, near Rustenburg. When Mabe died many years ago, Mmalekgwara was too young to take over so her uncle, Ntsatsi Mabe, became chief. However, when her uncle died, Mmalekgwara was not allowed to take over and Chief Moshe Mabe was put in charge. Mmalekgwara&rsquo;s son, Shimane Kau, claimed the commission recommended that Moshe should return the chieftaincy to Mmalekgwara and apologise to her. Moshe said he wasn&rsquo;t aware of the dispute, and that the matter had been settled by the Khumalo Commission in 2006.
