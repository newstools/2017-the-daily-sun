GRACE Bible Church members last Sunday got an earful of a visiting pastor&rsquo;s reported homophobic remarks.Yesterday they got a different sermon when the gay community protested outside the church.They stood outside the church in Pimville, Soweto in the scorching sun, condemning visiting Bishop Dag Heward-Mills&rsquo; alleged homophobic words.The message from the Bishop based in Accra, Ghana to church members so angered TV and radio personality Somizi Mhlongo that he walked out of church. The protesters held placards and condemned the pastorate for &ldquo;giving a platform to Mills&rsquo; homophobic remarks&rdquo;.Some of the placards read: &ldquo;Hate is not holy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Gays and lesbians are normal and human&rdquo;.Jeff Ogwaro, a sexual orientation and gender identity co-ordinator of Human Rights Organisation at the University of Pretoria said the LGBTI community would write to the church and ask for a meeting. At one stage church security members walked towards the crowd outside the church premises and got caught up in an exchange of words.
