ROYAL Eagles attacking midfielder Raymond Monama is reported to be wanted by two Absa Premiership stragglers, Bloemfontein Celtic and Baroka FC. But the 26-year-old has vowed to stay at the National First Division (NFD) big spenders and help them gain promotion to the Premier Soccer League (PSL) next season. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said it before and I&rsquo;m going to say again &ndash; my aim is to get back to the PSL with Eagles. I&rsquo;m fully committed to my team. I heard about those rumours that I&rsquo;m wanted by PSL clubs but to me those are just rumours. &ldquo;Nothing has been said to me,&rdquo; said Monama. Before the season started, the speedy midfielder was once quoted by SunSport saying he would jump ship should Eagles fail to get promotion. Now Monama, who has played in the big league for Mamelodi Sundowns and Black Leopards, sings a different tune and believes they can still catch up with log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu. &ldquo;We still stand a good chance to gain automatic promotion. We can catch up with Thanda and take their position. &ldquo;There are still plenty of games to play before the season ends. I want to help my team realise their dream of playing in the PSL and I believe this season that dream will come true. &ldquo;Things are going well and there&rsquo;s no need to leave,&rdquo; added Monama. At the moment Eagles are in second place in the NFD log table, 10 points behind leaders Thanda. The midfielder has scored 10 goals in 15 matches for his team, four goals behind teammate Sedwyn George who is currently leading the charge. George earlier overtook Thanda marksman Mhlengi Cele and ended the first round of matches with 14 goals. Cele, who was leading for a long time, is now in second place with 12 goals, with Monama in third spot.
