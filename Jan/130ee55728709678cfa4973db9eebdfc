ALGERIA&rsquo;S Georges Leekens became the first coaching casualty of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) yesterday, resigning less than three months after taking the job following his charges&rsquo; first round elimination.&ldquo;Given the pressure exerted on the federation and the national team, I prefer to stop my contract. For the good of all, I prefer to leave even if I do it with a sore heart, while wishing all the success in the world to the national team,&rdquo; said a statement on the Algerian Football Federation website.Algeria failed to win a game in Group A, finishing with a 2-2 draw against Senegal in Franceville on Monday for only their second point from three matches.They had been among the pre-tournament favourites but were held in their opening game by outsiders Zimbabwe and lost to neighbours Tunisia.It was the second spell in charge of Algeria for Leekens (67), who has also coached the Belgian and Tunisian national sides. He took the job in October, days after being fired by Belgian club Lokeren.Leekens&rsquo; availability coincided with Algeria&rsquo;s search for a coach after axing Milovan Rajevac. The Serbian had been in the job for 113 days before being fired after Algeria began their World Cup qualifying campaign with a home draw against Cameroon.Algeria have now been through four coaches since they reached the knockout phase of the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014. They do not have another competitive match until June. &ndash; REUTERS
