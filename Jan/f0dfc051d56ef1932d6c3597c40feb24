THEY will never forget their huge Christmas present!The Mdluli family of five siblings received a fully furnished home from the department of human settlements. They lived for years in an old shack following the death of their parents. The family&rsquo;s eldest child, Thembelihle Mdluli, was 17 at the time and had to fill the shoes of both parents. She had to look after her four siblings. They continued living in the shack in the hope that one day Thembelihle (now 23), could build them a proper home. Last week the five became one of seven families identified as vulnerable in the community of Lawley, in the Vaal.They were given houses as part of human settlements&rsquo; campaign of 16 days of activism against the abuse of women and children. The houses were built and fully furnished by Temi Construction and LTE Consulting. During the handover, Thembelihle could not hold back her tears of joy. She said: &ldquo;When both our parents died we never thought that there was someone out there who cared. &ldquo;Today we know that someone cares as we say goodbye to our shack and move into our new home.&rdquo; Keith Khoza of human settlements said the department strives to change the lives of people.&ldquo;By building houses we are also building the character and confidence of people. &ldquo;The Mdluli children will be able to point at their home and have a permanent address,&rdquo; he said.Freedom Hadebe of Temi Construction said other beneficiaries included elderly people and the family of Joy Dikotla (11), who lives with a disability.
