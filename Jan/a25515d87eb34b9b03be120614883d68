STELLAR South African athlete, Gladwin Mzazi, hopes for a change in fortunes following his disastrous 2016 campaign.The long-distance specialist was in tears when he failed to qualify for the Rio Olympic Games in Brazil last season.He was also sidelined because of a foot injury for three months, resulting his year changing from bad to worse.But Mzazi, the winner of the 10 000m World University Student Games gold medals in 2009 and 2013, has vowed to bounce back stronger this season.The 28-year-old has teamed up with veteran runner Hendrick Ramaala&rsquo;s training group in Joburg, in a quest to reclaim his glory days.The legendary Ramaala, a coach these days, is training a star-studded group of athletes at the Zoo Lake, including Phalula twins Lebo and Lebogang, Sibusiso Nzima, Lungile Gongqa and Desmond Mokgobu.Mzazi has undergone rehabilitation under Ramaala&rsquo;s watchful eye, and has resumed training in a bid to qualifying for the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championships to be held in London later this year.In April,Mzazi will take part in the 10 000m race at the South African Senior Athletics Championships to be held in Potchefstroom.He is also looking forward to securing races in Europe to boost his qualification for the London showpiece.&ldquo;The injury was a bitter pill to swallow. I was gutted to miss out on the Olympics, but life goes on,&rdquo; Mzazi said.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now fit and ready to get back in the action.&rdquo;Mzazi will miss out on the 10 000m trials next month due to lack of form, as he is still recovering.But he hopes to be competitive again from March.The athlete, who runs in the colours of Boxers athletics running club, finished 10th at the African Senior Athletics Championships in Durban last year.He competed at the IAAF World Cross Country championships in 2013 and 2015, and also took part in the World Half-marathon Championships in 2012 and 2016.Mzazi hopes Ramaala will help him with the technical aspects of his running.He told SunSport: &ldquo;Ramaala knows what he&rsquo;s doing. And I hope he&rsquo;ll help me.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still lacking that last kick. But my focus will be on when to sprint.&rdquo;
