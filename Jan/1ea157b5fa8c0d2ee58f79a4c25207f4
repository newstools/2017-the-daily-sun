COWS, dung, flies and stink go together &ndash; and that is why the animals are not allowed in urban areas.For two months, neighbours have been complaining about the cows in Msuthu Ndlovu&rsquo;s yard in AA section of Umlazi, KZN.Allegedly, family head Msuthu asked for two cows from another family in November last year as damage payment after one of their sons made his relative pregnant.Concerned neighbours told Daily Sun residents in the kasi prefer their damages to be paid in hard cash, not in the form of cows.&ldquo;The area can&rsquo;t handle it,&rdquo; said a neighbour.&ldquo;We fear we are going to get sick if these cows are not taken away.&rdquo;Another neighbour said the cows&rsquo; health will also suffer.&ldquo;There is not enough grass or water. &ldquo;They looked healthy when they came here. Now they have lost weight,&rdquo; said the neighbour. &ldquo;We want the authorities to intervene.&rdquo;A family member said the cows have caused a serious division in the family.&ldquo;Msuthu&rsquo;s sisters suggested damages be paid in cash, but he insisted he wanted cows. We know the neighbours are complaining, but there is nothing we can do.&rdquo; Msuthu said: &ldquo;I insisted that damages be paid in cows because I respect culture. &ldquo;I have hired a personal vet who treats them once in a while. &ldquo;They are not smelly and they don&rsquo;t have lice. They are healthy. I take them to the bush to graze.&rdquo;KZN Agriculture Department spokesman Khaye Nkwanyana said livestock is not allowed in urban areas.&ldquo;There is never enough grass for them, and they will starve. &ldquo;I advise residents to lodge a formal complaint with our veterinary unit so action can be taken,&rdquo; said Nkwanyana.
