ANGRY residents of Moeka in Hammanskraal, Tshwane vented their anger after the death of one from their community.On Sunday afternoon residents torched the family house of the North West MEC for Education, Sello Lehari. They also torched two of his cars.On Saturday residents had protested, demanding clean water. Sadly, the protest ended badly when one of the residents was shot dead by a member of a security company alleged to belong to the MEC.A resident claimed they recognised one of the people who shot at them as a man who works for Lehari.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen him guarding the family house and he also works as the MEC&rsquo;s bodyguard.&rdquo;The protesters believe that Lehari sent security guards to shoot at them.&ldquo;They get instructions from him so it&rsquo;s clear he told them to come and disrupt our protest. So residents decided to go and seek justice at his house. &ldquo;They wanted him to feel the pain they felt when their fellow resident died in front of their eyes,&rdquo; the resident said.According to the community, the protest was aimed at getting Councillor Robert Tseke&rsquo;s attention.Another resident, Nthabiseng Sokomela (34), said the water brought in tanks was dirty and they had tried to talk to Tseke about it. &ldquo;The water is dirty and ruins our clothes. It even turns our teeth brown.&rdquo; Tseke said only one tank contained dirty water and it was turned back.Kay Makhubela, provincial police spokesman, said cases of public violence, arson and murder were opened.&ldquo;We are still trying to establish the motive for the violence. Investigations are underway.&rdquo; The SunTeam tried to reach Lehari but his phone was on voicemail. Lehari is alleged to have fled with his parents when their house was set alight.
