There she was referred to Germiston Home Affairs.“I was then told to make an affidavit which I did. “The Home Affairs official was heavily pregnant and told me she would not be able to assist me with the follow-up as she was going on leave.” Tebogo said she does not know Anekwe and neither do her parents. “I don’t remember saying ‘I do’. I never went to the altar with this foreigner and never celebrated any wedding.”“I can’t get a job nor get married. I am stuck. I have met the love of my life, Danny Masobela, but we can’t get married. “He has bought me a ring to cheer me up and to help me stay hopeful that this matter will eventually be resolved.“The ring is not the real makoya but it symbolises our love. This even affects our sex life as I will be in bed with Danny or enjoying our supper and the next minute I will be quiet and deep in thought.“But my loving Danny just makes a joke and ask me if I am thinking about Anekwe.” Mayihlome Tshwete, Home Affairs spokesman, asked Daily Sun to send him a detailed enquiry and Tebogo’s contact number. “We will investigate the matter.”
