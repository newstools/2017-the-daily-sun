BEADS are not just colourful fashion accessories &ndash; because they also preserve culture! And no one is more proud of her culture than Faith Kibue (25). Faith sells her beautiful bead creations at local flea markets.Faith, from Malvern, Joburg, is originally from Kenya and her beads reflect her origins.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from a Masaai tribe and I have always worn beads as part of my culture.&rdquo;Faith said she was taught by her sister Ruth Kibue (37), who is now back in Kenya. &ldquo;I specialise in necklaces, bracelets, sandals, spoons, handbags and other fashion accessories for stores and clients,&rdquo; said Faith.She can be found every Tuesday at Bruma Lake flea market. On Wednesdays she is at Rosebank and on Saturdays she trades in Soweto. Her beads carry different cultural meanings in her home country.&ldquo;In Kenya, for example, we wear beads for many reasons. Married and unmarried women will wear different beads. Even colours have meaning,&rdquo; said Faith.She said blue is for energy, yellow for fertility and growth and red for strength. Faith is also a freelance cook when she is not working on beads: &ldquo;I studied culinary art at HTA in Randburg with the money I made from selling my beadwork.&rdquo;Her prices range from R40 to R150 for necklaces, R100 for handbags and R30 for spoons.
