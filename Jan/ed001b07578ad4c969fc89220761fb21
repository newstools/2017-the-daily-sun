ANGRY residents went on the rampage on Sunday night to protest against crime in their area. The chaos in Moiletswane, outside Klipgat in North West, led to one man being burnt to death and his friend beaten to a pulp. Community members told Daily Sun the men were part of a group of four that had been robbing people in the area. The suspects were caught on Sunday night when residents spotted a car they didn&rsquo;t know and blew the whistle.However, two of the men escaped. Resident Noma Nkwinika (51) said one of the men locked himself in the car, which led to his death when furious residents set the vehicle alight. Noma claimed the thugs had been harassing residents since last year. &ldquo;People have been killed and robbed of their valuables by unknown thugs since the beginning of last year.&rdquo; She said residents were tired of constantly falling victim to crime, which was why they had decided to take matters into their own hands. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t sleep in peace because of them. I hope this will be a lesson to others not to try their luck in this area.&rdquo; Another angry resident, Simon Maluleka (38), said they were tired of depending on the police to investigate cases.&ldquo;From today, thugs will think twice before entering our area.&ldquo;We have to set an example to criminals who turn our kasi into their playground.&rdquo; Police and paramedics eventually came to the rescue of the second man, who had been beaten by residents. North West police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said cases of murder and malicious damage to property were opened. &ldquo;The police are busy with investigations. No arrests have been made yet.&rdquo;
