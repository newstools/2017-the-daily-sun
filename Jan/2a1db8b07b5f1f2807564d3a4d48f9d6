PARENTS in the north of Tshwane have vowed to boycott the basic education department&rsquo;s online registration.Since the beginning of this week, parents from Mabopane, Soshanguve, Ga-Rankuwa, Hebron and surrounding kasis have flocked to the department to complain about the system.Thousands claim they were referred to schools but their applications were rejected.MEC Panyaza Lesufi launched the online admission system for grade 1 and grade 8 last year.Parents said they applied online last year but received no response as to whether their kids had been accepted or not. They said they arrived at the district early to find out what the delay was and waited for hours before hearing the office was offline.They said they were told to go home and wait for a message either accepting or declining a pupil&rsquo;s admission. One parent said she had come to the department for a late application because she didn&rsquo;t know how to register online and was told local schools were full.Department spokesman Oupa Bodibe said: &ldquo;We call on parents to bear with us. Our registration system is taking strain with all these registrations. We had to reboot the system several times. We understand online registration can be time consuming.&rdquo;
