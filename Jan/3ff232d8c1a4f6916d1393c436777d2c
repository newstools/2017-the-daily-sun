IT STARTED as a joke, but now it has gone viral.While some people say it&rsquo;s just a weird hoax, others warn that it may attract bad luck or even worse!THERE IS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT DEATH, THEY SAY.Speaking to Daily Sun, many people condemned what has become known on social media as the &ldquo;death pose&rdquo;.It is when people, mostly teenagers, post horrific pictures of what they call their &ldquo;way out&rdquo; of the world. &ldquo;These people are sick in the head,&rdquo; said a resident of Orange Farm in the Vaal. &ldquo;These people are inviting death into their own lives or the lives of their families,&rdquo; said a resident of the Joburg CBD. An angry resident of Soweto said: &ldquo;I am speechless. People have lost their minds. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just leave them to die.&rdquo; A stern warning comes from cultural and traditional expert Matshediso Mothwalo. &ldquo;Death is never funny. When people pose as the dead they are attracting bad luck. In our culture we do not allow people to pose as dead because they not only call bad luck down on themselves but on their families too,&rdquo; he said. Inyanga Mahlinza Dlamini said culture and tradition do not allow people to play with death.

But late yesterday people were still posting horrible photographs of their mock deaths. Some are graphic pictures taken in bathrooms and lounges, with people who look as if they are hanging from the roof. Others faked their death in front of their own cars. Images of people dying from axe attacks, hanging, hit-and-runs, drownings and falling are seen everywhere. On social media some view the trend as being scary, while others are finding it funny. Matieho Morake said on Facebook: &ldquo;What was the motive behind the death pose? Lol. Ai hle lenna keya tsamaya. I am leaving South Africa.&rdquo; Lloyd Khonto replied: &ldquo;Man this country is one of a kind. Where else would you see something like this? I ain&rsquo;t going nowhere.&rdquo;
