FEDERATION of Uganda Football Associations (Fufa) president Moses Magogo says they will retain the Cranes coach Micho Sredejovic despite him failing in his mandate to qualify the team for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) quarterfinals.The Cranes were the first team knocked out of the tournament on Saturday after losing 1-0 to both Ghana and Egypt without scoring a single goal.Magogo said they believed Sredejovic would continue with the team until his contract ends in 2018. He has another mandate &ndash; to qualify for the Russia Fifa World Cup in 2018, where they coincidentally share Group E with Ghana and Egypt.&ldquo;He is our coach and it is our decision to keep him, plus he still has a running contract with us,&rdquo; said Magogo after addressing players following their loss to Egypt at the Stade de Port-Gentil on Saturday.&ldquo;We still need him. He has brought us here (2017 Afcon) after 39 years of failing to qualify. He can still take us to the World Cup in Russia. &ldquo;The players must have learnt a lot here, considering it was our first time (at Afcon) in years. It was the first experience of this kind for our players.&rdquo;Sredejovic expressed his &ldquo;full 200% commitment&rdquo; and claims the loss to Egypt has left a bitter taste in his mouth &ldquo;because we didn&rsquo;t deserve this&rdquo;.Said Sredejovic: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re capable of holding our own against any team. We have ambitions &ndash; and a team capable of competing against any team on the same level on the continent.&rdquo;Goalkeeper Denis Onyango, probably the pride of Uganda after being voted 2016 Caf Player of the Year Based in Africa, has thrown his weight behind Sredejovic. &ldquo;He has done his part, we just lost due to inexperience,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He is the right man for the job. My wish is that the federation keeps him, but if he wants to move on &ndash; that is the life of a soccer coach. He has done well for Uganda. &ldquo;I am feeling emotional right now. It was an emotion-filled moment when I heard Uganda&rsquo;s national anthem sung at Afcon. &ldquo;We must all stay humble and focused on the Mali match (tonight).&rdquo;
