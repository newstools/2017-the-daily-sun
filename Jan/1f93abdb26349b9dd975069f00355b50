&ldquo;A TAVERN is a place for booze, not to queue for a poo!&rdquo;This was the refrain of more than 50 gatvol KwaNdokwenza residents in Port Elizabeth as they protested over their kasi&rsquo;s lack of toilets.The residents claimed that their kasi hasn&rsquo;t had any toilets for more than five years, and that in order to relieve themselves they had to use the tavern&rsquo;s toilet. The area used to be a single men&rsquo;s hostel, but it was later converted into family units. Residents claim that the hostel&rsquo;s toilet block was demolished by community members because it caused a stink.Thandeka Lamani (49) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke or drink booze but I find myself in and out of Nzoto&rsquo;s tavern. &ldquo;This is an embarrassing situation but I have no choice.&ldquo;Our children are also forced to go there. This is very bad.&rdquo;Resident Sabelo Mlumbi said: &ldquo;Our councillor blamed the DA for his failures. He has also failed to supply us with temporary toilets.&rdquo;Ward 20 Councillor Bongo Nombiba said: &ldquo;The DA-led coalition government is delaying the process. The ANC completed the process, but we lost to the DA. We gave these people temporary toilets but they rejected them. Then we wanted to build them communal toilets but they also rejected them, so we built them in another area.&rdquo; Mthubanzi Mniki, the Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman, said their sanitation department will visit the place to determine the problem and sort it out.Tavern owner Mtuzimele Mzali (67) showed us a water bill for R26 111 and said: &ldquo;I am helping my neighbours because they don&rsquo;t have toilets. In return they support my business.&rdquo;
