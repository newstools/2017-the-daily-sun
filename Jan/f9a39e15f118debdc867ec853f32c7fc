A FATHER (38), of Motherwell NU 29 kasi in Port Elizabeth, said lobola or no lobola, he wants his child back.However his in-laws want him to pay R5 000 for lobola.His daughter is living with her mother&rsquo;s relatives in KwaCiti kasi, Komga, in the Eastern Cape while her mother Phatiswa Mkontwana (36) is works in Cape Town. But the father wants to live with his daughter.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have R5 000. I earn a living by driving a jikeleza taxi. I told my in-laws I can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo; He said living without his daughter was stressing him.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep because my daughter is not happy where she is. I last saw her in December 2011, when I went to fetch her and her mother. &ldquo;But I was detained and fined R1000 by my in-laws for failing to pay lobola. &ldquo;I was set free the following day after I paid the penalty. I came back with my fiance only and was told I could get my child once I had paid the required lobola. &ldquo;Later my fiance went to work in Cape Town but we agreed that I should fetch my daughter from Komga.&rdquo; He said his in-laws&rsquo; neighbours had tipped him off about his daughter&rsquo;s living conditions.&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t attend school regularly because she has to look after cows. She phoned me in December and told me that she was given liquor to drink in order to forget about me.&rdquo;But a relative (45) from Komga slammed the father&rsquo;s claims: &ldquo;He did not impregnate a cow. &ldquo;He must pay the lobola. We are sick and tired of his baseless accusations and empty promises. &ldquo;He can come and take his daughter.&rdquo;Eastern Cape social development spokesman Mzukisi Solani said: &ldquo;If the father feels his daughter is being kept illegitimately, he must go to the police in Komga and ask for assistance.&rdquo;
