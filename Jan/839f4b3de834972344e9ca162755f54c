THE Seruwane Community Property Association is still waiting for a signature from the Land Claims Commissioner to receive five properties. The association from Marble Hall in Limpopo claims the rural development department has been playing games with their submission ever since they put in their claim in 1998. One property was handed over in 2012 but they have been waiting since then for the other five, which has led to divisions in the community. Some members of the association have started losing trust in their leaders and others have even started invading the land. Association chairman David Madisha said they had visited the department&rsquo;s provincial offices several times to get answers. &ldquo;We have been getting the same explanation for nine years. We just need a signature but it seems no one is interested in the matter. &ldquo;How can it take so long to get a signature? They have been playing games with our submission and now people are invading our land although we were instructed not to develop anything on it until the claim was processed. &ldquo;They have been delaying section 42(d) of phase two without giving us any concrete reason.&rdquo;Limpopo Rural Development spokesman Avhashoni Magada said the delay was caused by conflict between the affected community and members of the association&rsquo;s committee. He urged them to resolve their differences.
