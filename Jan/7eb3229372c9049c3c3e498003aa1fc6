ROBERT MARAWA and Pearl Thusi are in love.But Pearl&rsquo;s father is a very angry man. BECAUSE ROBERT HASN&rsquo;T PAID ILOBOLO!Bhekizizwe Thusi, a Durban taxi boss, spoke to the People&rsquo;s Paper.Everything looks glitzy for the two love birds.But Pearl&rsquo;s dad is reeling with anger and disappointment.He accuses the Marawa family of disrespect.He says they are ignoring the fact that they must pay ilobolo for his daughter.Bhekizizwe told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;The Marawa family treats Pearl as their makoti. But they haven&rsquo;t united the two families in the traditional way.&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m still waiting for the Marawas to come for ilobolo negotiations.&rdquo;The angry taxi boss told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Pearl told me about the engagement. But she didn&rsquo;t say when the Marawa family were planning to pay ilobolo for her.&ldquo;In my family, ilobolo is paid. And only then can they claim our daughter as their makoti.&ldquo;I get the impression this family undermines me as Pearl&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; he said.But the old man said he&rsquo;s not planning to call the Marawa family and ask for ilolobo payment.&ldquo;Why should I go to them?&rdquo; &ldquo;They know how we do things as traditional people. They know they must do the right thing.&ldquo;And the Marawas have a background of rural life. They know exactly what they must do.&ldquo;Pearl hasn&rsquo;t said anything to me about the wedding. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe, they got married without my knowledge,&rdquo; said Bhekizizwe.He revealed that the Marawa family didn&rsquo;t inform him about Robert&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;They told me when he was still ill. They even fetched me twice to go and see him in hospital. But they didn&rsquo;t tell me when he died.&ldquo;I only read about his death and funeral in the newspapers.&ldquo;Even my daughter didn&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; he said.When the SunTeam asked him how he got on with Pearl, Bhekizizwe said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it. But I have told myself that I raised her and did everything to my power to make her happy.&ldquo;Pearl is old enough to choose what&rsquo;s right for her. I don&rsquo;t need her to provide for me.&ldquo;I have a taxi business that is doing very well. I can take care of myself and my family.&rdquo;Robert&rsquo;s mum, Phumlile Zulu, said the family was still mourning the death of Frank Marawa.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t think of a wedding anytime soon. We&rsquo;re still mourning. And I can&rsquo;t comment on what you&rsquo;re asking me about,&rdquo; she said.Efforts to get comment from both Pearl and Robert were unsuccessful.They also failed to respond to our SMSes.Pearl&rsquo;s manager Sarit Tomlinson of Capacity Relations could not be reached for comment, and she failed to respond to our SMSes and email sent yesterday.
