THE people of Dihlabeng and Masilonyana municipalities in the Free State, and Mamusa in the Northern Cape, can breathe a sigh of relief. Eskom yesterday announced that it had suspended planned power interruptions as payment agreements had been reached with the municipalities. Interim Eskom CEO Matshela Koko said: &ldquo;We have always emphasised the fact that electricity interruptions are the last resort available to us. &ldquo;We are immensely encouraged by the kind of response we are witnessing.&rdquo; Koko said Eskom would be strictly monitoring the municipalities to make sure they stuck to payment plans. &ldquo;The time has come for the outstanding overdue debt to be honoured in full,&rdquo; he saidHowever, power cuts would continue in municipalities that had not paid Eskom or made arrangements to do so. Eskom will be cutting power to the municipalities between 6am and 8am and 5pm and 7.30pm on weekdays, and between 8.30am and 11am and 3pm and 5.30pm on weekends.
