SURPRISE, Comfort and Moses must have been very happy to see Cockroach Mdluli arriving to save them.The three young men, Surprise Mushwana (21), Comfort Makwakwa (18) and Moses Mzimba (24) got trapped in the river after helping kids cross. They got trapped in the overflowing N&rsquo;wandlamharhi River, which flows through Dumphries Villages into Kruger National Park outside Thulamahashe near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. The river is infested with crocodiles and hippos. Community policing forum member, Albert Sihlangu, said villagers held a prayer service as police and the municipal fire and rescue team arrived. Once the rescue team arrived, it took chief officer, Rexon Silinda, and his assistant Cockroach Mdluli about 30 minutes to rescue the trapped men.&ldquo;Residents are warned to keep away and not to cross rivers or dams. We&rsquo;re expecting more heavy rain,&rdquo; said Silinda. Comfort said: &ldquo;We were helping kids cross the river. We were in the middle of the river when it suddenly came down. We climbed on a big rock in the river. I phoned my friend, Fight Sihlangu, and my family who called the ward councillor, Lindiwe Sithole, who then called in the police and rescue team.&rdquo;
