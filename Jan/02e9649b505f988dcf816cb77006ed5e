HE IS the top cop in the country, but he and his wife have allegedly been living the life of millionaires.The police watchdog s investigation into the lavish lifestyle of acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane now includes looking into the couple s R4,3 million fleet of luxury cars.This follows an investigation into Phahlane s purchase of an R80 000 sound system.He insists he paid for the sound system which was installed in his house by a company that is a service provider to the police s forensics department.There are also questions surrounding Phahlane s R8 million home, allegedly paid for partly in cash, and with a bond considerably lower than the value of the house.Independent Police Investigative Directorate investigators probed alleged cash payments to a contractor totalling R700 000. The money was allegedly in plastic shopping bags in the boot of a car.Following last week s raid on Phalane s home in Sable Hills Waterfront Estate in Tshwane, Ipid said the lifestyle probe into the top cop would now include the seven vehicles he and his wife Beauty Phahlane bought over the last two years. The vehicles under investigation include a Land Rover Discovery, a Range Rover Sport, a 4X4 Toyota Hilux, a VW Polo, a VW Amarok and a Mercedes Benz E250 CDI.Phahlane claims he produced proof of payment for the sound system.Police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said the allegations against Phahlane were an attempt to defame and humiliate him. As in the instance where it was widely and inaccurately reported that he had received a sound system as a corrupt gift, the allegations in this story are misleading and false, she said.Ipid also obtained a warning statement last week from Phahlane relating to allegations he had attempted to defeat the ends of justice during their investigation.
