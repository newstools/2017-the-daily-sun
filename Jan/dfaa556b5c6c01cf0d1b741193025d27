MADALA Johannes Mashiloane (62) survived by the skin of his teeth!He jumped out of bed just in time before the wall of his mud house collapsed on him. The madala said he was having a nap on Sunday when he heard a bang on the roof. &ldquo;I opened my eyes and saw the wall slowly falling.&rdquo;He said he doesn&rsquo;t know how he managed to quickly jump out of bed and run outside in time. &ldquo;My ancestors still love me and if it wasn&rsquo;t for that I would be injured or dead by now.&rdquo; The madala, from Mpheleng near Dennilton in Limpopo, said the heavy rain last Saturday made the foundations of his mud house weak and that&rsquo;s why the wall collapsed. He told Daily Sun he has tried many times to get an RDP house without success, although many of his neighbours have RDPs. &ldquo;When it rained on Saturday I was holding my breath that it would not affect my house.&ldquo;I built it because I don&rsquo;t have money to build myself a proper house. &ldquo;I only survive by doing odd jobs in the community. &ldquo;Building a mud house was the only thing I could do in order to have a roof over my head.&rdquo; The madala said he doesn&rsquo;t know where he will sleep until he gets the chance to rebuild. Councillor Lizzy Moima said officials will assess the madala&rsquo;s situation. She said together with the municipality they are in the process of helping the madala get an RDP house and in the meantime, the municipality will try to help him.
