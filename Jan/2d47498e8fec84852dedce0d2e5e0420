THE Mojapelo family from Mamahule, outside Polokwane in Limpopo, claimed that the Polokwane cop shop is useless and of no help to them.They said they have not seen any progress on several cases opened with the police since last year. The first case was opened in April 2015 and the last one in November.The family claimed police failed to act since they had opened cases of malicious damage to property, intimidation and assault against a group of people in the area. They claimed the group demolished several residents&rsquo; shacks on stands allocated to them by the family.Several families claimed to be the rightful owners of the Mamahule section next to Dalmada and want to be the ones selling stands. Community leader Kgopotso Mojapelo told Daily Sun they were worried that their cases were being swept under the carpet. Apparently more shacks were &shy;demolished over the recent festive season. Mojapelo claimed they informed police without success.&ldquo;I was assaulted and injured by the same people. I opened a case, but to date I&rsquo;m still waiting for any progress report. &ldquo;We also opened cases of malicious damage to property and intimidation &shy;after our clients&rsquo; shacks were demolished and they were threatened with death, but nothing is happening,&rdquo; claimed Mojapelo.Polokwane police spokesman Captain Ntobeng Phala rejected the Mojapelos&rsquo; accusations. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true that we&rsquo;re doing nothing about their cases. The suspects have been informed of the cases opened against them and police are investigating the matter,&rdquo; said Phala.
