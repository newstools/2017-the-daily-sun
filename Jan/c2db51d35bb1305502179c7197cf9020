CLINTON Larsen hopes the experience Kudakwashe Mahachi and Danny Phiri gained in their debuts at the African Cup of Nations (Afcon) will have a good impact on Golden Arrows. The two were part of the Zimbabwean team booted from the current Afcon in Gabon in the group stage. The Warriors were only able to draw one of their three matches in Group B &ndash; against Algeria. They lost the other two to Senegal and Tunisia. Larsen said he was expecting the two to start training with their Arrows teammates on Monday. &ldquo;They will arrive in the country on Sunday. I understand that they will be very disappointed about what transpired in Gabon. I will talk to them about the tournament and try to comfort them. &ldquo;But what makes me really happy is that they did well in the matches they played. Mahachi even scored a goal and Phiri was strong in the midfield. I just hope they will bring that into our team because we really need such inspiration,&rdquo; said the coach. Larsen, who played for Manning Rangers and Orlando Pirates, said even though he was also disappointed about Zimbabwe&rsquo;s early exit, he was relieved that his players would be returning without injury. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s every coach&rsquo;s dream to see his players return from international duty injury-free. I&rsquo;m happy they are fine. A team like Arrows with a small squad can&rsquo;t afford to lose players to injury.&rdquo;The other coach who will be happy to see his player return injury-free is Roger de Sa of Maritzburg United. The Team of Choice have been without their striker, Evans Rusike, who also plays for Zimbabwe. Like Mahachi and Phiri, Rusike got a run in the tournament too, playing in the match against Senegal. He will join his new coach and the rest of his teammates at Maritzburg next week.
