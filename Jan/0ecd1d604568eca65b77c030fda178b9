GOLDEN Arrows are certain that former Orlando Pirates forward Chiukepo Msowoya will sign with them sooner rather than later.The 29-year-old Malawian international has been training with Arrows for two weeks as coach Clinton Larsen looks to strengthen his striking department. Said Arrows general manager, Gordon Masondo: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been assessing Msowoya for a while now and are in negotiations with him. We are certain we will clinch a deal with him soon. His contract with his team in Malawi (Nyasa Big Bullets) has expired. The good thing is that he&rsquo;s familiar with South African football, as he has played here for Pirates.&rdquo;Msowoya, who played for Bucs seven years ago, was on fire in the TNM Super league last year, finishing second in the goal-scorers&rsquo; chart with 16 goals, three behind Mafco&rsquo;s Richard Mbulu. Big Bullets finished runners-up &ndash; a point behind champs Kamuzu Barracks. In the 2015 season he was joint top goal-scorer with Red Lions&rsquo; Innocent Bokosi with 14 goals. Masondo also confirmed Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende&rsquo;s intent to tie down captain Trevor Mathiane, who has entered the last six months of his contract. Even though Mathiane has seen limited game-time so far this season, it appears he is still part of the technical team&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;We are aware that teams have enquired about Trevor&rsquo;s availability. But we still need him and will start negotiations with him soon for a contract extension,&rdquo; he said. Should Msowoya sign with Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende he will be joining Zimbabwean striker Knox Mutizwa, who has been loaned to Arrows by Bidvest Wits for the remainder of the season. Mutizwa joined Wits at the beginning of the season from Highlands in Zimbabwe but found the going tough at the Students and has not played any official matches for them.
