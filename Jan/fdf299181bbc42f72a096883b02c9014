Social grant payments will not be disrupted when the social development department&rsquo;s contract with Cash Paymaster Services ends on April 1, the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) said yesterday."We want to assure the beneficiaries of social grants that definitely, on April 1, everybody will be getting their grants," spokesperson Paseka Letsatsi said.In April 2014, the Constitutional Court tasked the department with taking over payments after it was found that there were irregularities in the appointment of CPS.Opposition parties were angered on Wednesday when Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini cancelled her appearance at Parliament to report back on progress made in taking over the grant payments.Dlamini and Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza were due to tell Parliament&rsquo;s social development committee if they were ready to take over the nationwide social grants scheme on April 1.Committee chairperson Rose Capa on Wednesday said the meeting was cancelled because she, Dlamini and Magwaza were attending an African National Congress lekgotla.Democratic Alliance MP Bridget Masango claimed Dlamini had in fact flown to Ethiopia on ANC Women's League business. Dlamini is the ANCWL&rsquo;s chairperson.Opposition MPs were concerned that Sassa and the department were not ready to take over the payment system, and that come April 1, beneficiaries would not get their grants.Letsatsi said Dlamini would update Parliament on Wednesday, after she had consulted Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank.He said no-one would be prejudiced by the consulting processes.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/no-grant-payment-disruption-on-april-1-sassa-promises-20170127
