THERE are many unsung heroes who emerge during war.Some never get recognition for their deeds, while others are honoured only many years after their heroism.One such a hero is Chiune Sugihara, who was a Japanese diplomat in Lithuania during World War II.He and his wife, Yukiko, saved the lives of at least 6 000 people.For 29 days, Chiune and Yukiko &ndash; against clear instructions from Japan &ndash; wrote and signed visas for Jewish refugees by hand, finishing some 300 a day. These visas gave the refugees permission to travel through the Soviet Union to reach an island under Dutch control, where they would be safe. When his country&rsquo;s consulate was closed in 1940 due to the war and the family had to board a train, it is said that Chiune was still writing visas and throwing them out of the train window.Israel honoured Chiune for his heroism in 1985, a year before he died at the age of 86.
