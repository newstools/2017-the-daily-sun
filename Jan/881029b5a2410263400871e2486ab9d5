GOGO Lettie Mahlangu is a very spiritual woman.The 67-year-old from Slovo in Mabopane, Tshwane, loves her garden and believes that her ancestors live in it!She also keeps a variety of sculptures in her precious garden and believes they keep evil away and bring visitors to her home.Lettie created a garden area in her yard where she put couches, chairs, tables and flowers.She said she lived alone and would often get bored, which is why she created a small park for people to visit her from time to time.But the park didn&rsquo;t work until she placed sculptures at a spot where she usually speaks to her ancestors.&ldquo;People started coming to my house asking to chill in the garden and that was when I realised that the sculptures were working,&rdquo; she said.Gogo Lettie added people are attracted by the beautiful park and stop to take pictures of it.&ldquo;People love it. They say they have never seen anything like it. On holidays, kids play here every day. I&rsquo;m so happy because I don&rsquo;t get bored anymore.&rdquo; Gogo Lettie said she even used her pension money to buy the kids sweets and ice pops when they visit.&ldquo;Before the park, people didn&rsquo;t know me, but now I am very popular.&rdquo; The gogo said some people even ask to host events in her park on Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s Day and Good Friday.Lettie&rsquo;s neighbour, Tshepiso Mogotsi (39), said she didn&rsquo;t need to worry about her children anymore because she knows they are always safe at gogo&rsquo;s yard.&ldquo;I no longer have to wonder where my kids have gone to.&ldquo;They play just next to our home and I know that gogo Lettie takes good care of them.&ldquo;I have no worries,&rdquo; said Tshepiso.&ldquo;My kids now know stories of old because of gogo. They also know how to talk to their elders because gogo teaches them manners,&rdquo; she said.
