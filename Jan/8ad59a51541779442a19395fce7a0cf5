THE brother of a missing woman said his sister&rsquo;s disappearance in the Mutale area in Limpopo has left his family worried. Khathutshelo Mandevu of Khalavha told Daily Sun his sister, Lufuno Mandevu (29), was last seen on Friday 27 December.Lufuno reported for duty at her work in Thohoyandou and after work headed for Bashasha to consult a prophet there. That was the last time she was seen. &ldquo;After realising that she was not coming back home, we started tracing her movements,&rdquo; said Khathutshelo. &ldquo;Some people gave a lift to the prophet who told them that he was going to meet a client, who happened to be Lufuno. They met her on the road and the prophet joined Lufuno there.&rdquo; The family was told that the two were seen together the following day. &ldquo;We confronted the prophet, pretending we also needed help. The prophet did not want to come near us as he told us he was performing some sort of rituals.&ldquo;When asked about the whereabouts of Lufuno, he said he knew nothing about her. We are becoming more worried as days are passing by without hearing anything from her. &ldquo;My sister left two children and they have no one to look after them. As a family, we cannot even sleep or eat.&rdquo;Limpopo police spokesman, Captain Ndidzulafhi Nelufule, confirmed that a missing person&rsquo;s docket was opened.&ldquo;We are appealing to members of the public to give us whatever information they might have concerning this case. Those with information can contact their nearest police station,&rdquo; he said.
