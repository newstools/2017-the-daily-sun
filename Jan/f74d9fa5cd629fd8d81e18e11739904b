UKHOZI FM DJ, Khetha Gwala, is accused of being a player of note!His overseas-based girlfriend, Nombuso Gcabashe, who is currently in Amsterdam as part of The Lion King production, accusing him of two-timing her with other women.She said she met the DJ at the Metro FM Music Awards last year.&ldquo;I was on vacation when we met. It was love at first sight and he took care of me,&rdquo; she said.Nombuso said they&rsquo;d been madly in love, until recently, when DJ Khetha asked her to come visit like she usually did.She said: &ldquo;When I arrived, he started ignoring my calls. He even blocked me on all social media. I was heartbroken.&rdquo;She said she regretted ignoring warnings about Khetha being a player.But Khetha dismissed Nombuso&rsquo;s claims and said: &ldquo;I got miss calls from her. That day I couldn&rsquo;t answer my phone. She went on social media and said all sorts of things to tarnish my image. I blocked her people. She sent my colleagues inboxes and posted on Ukhozi FM&rsquo;s social pages. &ldquo;My friend and his sister intervened, and tried to sort our issues out. I don&rsquo;t know what changed.&ldquo;I told her we were over and if she continued I&rsquo;d sue her, and she told me she had friends who are journalists and would drag my name through the mud.&rdquo;Nombuso said: &ldquo;I want to expose him. Guys like him get away with this, as they&rsquo;re celebritiesRight now I&rsquo;m scared even of my well-being because I don&rsquo;t know how many girls he has done this to before .&rdquo;But I gave him benefit of the doubt as he seemed like a sweet man. We had problems and he invited me to come to Mzansi to fix our relationship issues. &ldquo;He assured me he wanted things to work out between us and that&rsquo;s why he would avail himself. I bought a plane ticket which cost me R14 000, but didn&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; Nombuso said. She said Khetha knew she had no one to cry to, so he thought he could get away with his behaviour.Khetha said he and Nombuso started having problem while she was still overseas because he felt that their relationship wasn&rsquo;t working. &ldquo;She booked flight tickets without my knowledge and sent me a picture, I didn&rsquo;t have a problem.
