AT least four people have been killed and 15 others injured in a suicide bomb attack on a university campus in northeast Nigeria.The blast happened yesterday at a mosque in the staff quarters area of the University of Maiduguri, and is thought to have been carried out by a teenage girl, a local resident and a lecturer told AFP news agency.There was no immediate claim of responsibility but suspicion will likely fall on the armed group Boko Haram, which has repeatedly used young women and girls as human bombs.Borno cop spokesman Victor Isuku said that before the blast at the mosque, police on patrol shot a girl aged about 12 as she tried to get into the university at about 4am."The improvised explosive device strapped to her body exploded, killing her instantly," he said in a statement."Shortly after that a second explosion occurred in a mosque inside the university."Four persons, including a professor and the second suicide bomber, died, while 15 persons sustained various degrees of injuries and were rushed to hospital."Access to the university campus has been strictly controlled, with checkpoints and searches at the gates, which until now had prevented a direct attack.But the site, on one of the main thoroughfares leading in to and out of the city, is vast and most areas are badly lit.Students also said security has been relaxed in recent months and some of the soldiers who manned the campus gates have been withdrawn.At least 20,000 people have been killed in the Boko Haram conflict since it began in 2009 and more than 2.6 million others made homeless.&nbsp;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/01/suicide-attack-hits-nigeria-university-maiduguri-170116112753904.html
