THEY were ready to sell the meat of a stolen cow &ndash; but only after they had enjoyed a feast of their own!But they never got to make a profit or even fill their bellies.The three accused were sitting down and braaiing the cow&rsquo;s liver at their shack in Winterveld, Tshwane, when the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals arrived &ndash; with the cops!Meshack Matlou, an inspector for the animal society, said they got a tip- off that a cow which had been stolen in Limpopo was being slaughtered.He got to the scene with the Loate and Tshwane Metro Police, and they found the three men.Two of the men fled, but another who was apparently drunk was arrested.Matlou said the meat was properly prepared and ready to be sold.&ldquo;It was already in buckets and neatly arranged,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We traced the cow&rsquo;s brand to a farm in Limpopo but we could not contact the owner,&rdquo; he said.He said he was concerned about the killing of the animals in Winterveld.&ldquo;Most animals are getting treated and should not be eaten because they can make people really sick,&rdquo; he said.He said it is easy to identify animals with brands, so he advised farmers to brand their livestock.Residents who came to witness the incident said they did not know the cow had been stolen.&ldquo;We are shocked to see this. It is really disappointing,&rdquo; one witness said.Loate police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of livestock theft had been opened and the arrested man would appear in court soon.
