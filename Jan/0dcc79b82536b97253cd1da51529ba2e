THE portions served at the school&rsquo;s nutrition programme were getting smaller and smaller.But the relatives of three parents who were helping out in the school kitchen kept feasting.That was until Friday, when teachers bust them with bags full of food!Three parents were dismissed from Limekhaya High School&rsquo;s feeding scheme for allegedly stealing food. Lamile Faltein, principal of the school in KwaLanga, Uitenhage said pupils had been complaining since the beginning of last year. He said the pupils told him they were not getting enough food even though delicious meals were cooked in the school kitchen every day. &ldquo;We suspected something was not right in our kitchen when some of the pupils started complaining. &ldquo;We even tried to increase our supply, but there was never enough food.&ldquo;On Friday we held a staff meeting and let our pupils leave at midday. &ldquo;But to our surprise, these women were still in the kitchen at 1.30pm. &ldquo;My deputy went to the kitchen and found their bags filled with food. &ldquo;We kicked them out and reported them to the cops,&rdquo; he said.A parent who didn&rsquo;t want to be named said: &ldquo;I am very happy that these women were finally caught. &ldquo;They had been bragging about not buying groceries at home and filling their stomachs with food meant for our kids. &ldquo;We had to turn a blind eye to their evil deeds because they claimed that were untouchable. &ldquo;We were too scared to report the matter to the principal,&rdquo; she said. Police spokeswoman Lieutenant Gerda Swarts said: &ldquo;The matter was reported to the police and a case of theft was opened.&rdquo;
