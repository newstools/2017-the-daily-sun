This is my third Lifetime Achievement Award, after I was previously honoured in the SABC Crown Gospel Music Awards and Ingoma Awards,&rdquo; he said.Big Fish said he felt young and energetic when he went to the podium to receive the award. &ldquo;It shows that different organisations are appreciative of my work. After I won the first award, I thought it was the end and didn&rsquo;t know it would open many doors.&rdquo;Big Fish is committed to continue developing young gospel artists.Last year, he auditioned 30 young singers in Mpumalanga. And the choir came to be known as Mpumalanga Praise.Last February, the choir also went on to release its new album titled, Mpumalanga Praise Live in Church on the Hill, in collaboration with the Department of Culture, Sports and Recreation.He has vowed to continue searching and developing different talent in the province. His choir&rsquo;s performance was on 31 December in the Siyabonga Crusade in Middelburg, Mpumalanga in front of more than 20 000 people. He appealed to people to support the choir because it is a job creation for them. &ldquo;Without doubt, their music will bless many people all over the world,&rdquo; he said.
