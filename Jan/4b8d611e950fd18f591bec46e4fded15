Steven Gerrard admits he is &ldquo;nervous&rdquo; about his return to Liverpool, as he takes the first steps in his coaching career.Gerrard will begin his role as an academy coach at Anfield next month after hanging up his boots at the conclusion of his LA Galaxy contract in November.The 36-year-old rejected the opportunity to take the managerial role at English third tier outfit MK Dons in November after admitting he wasn&rsquo;t ready to step into the dug-out straightaway.He hopes a return to Anfield will further his coaching education, although he is anxious at restarting employment with Liverpool after leaving the club in 2015."Liverpool are prepared to help me an awful lot. They want to help me to become a better coach or a better manager," Gerrard told the BBC.."But at the same time I've got to commit to it and put in the hard work."I'm very excited but at the same time a little bit nervous and a little bit anxious because it's a brand new role, one that I'm really looking forward to getting my teeth into."I've a lot of dreams and aspirations to be the best I can be in terms of coaching and management - but we'll have to wait and see if I'm going to be good enough."
