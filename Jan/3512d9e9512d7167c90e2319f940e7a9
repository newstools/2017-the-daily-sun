WHEN her energetic son got artificial legs the first time, mum Phumzile Nkambule (29) was very happy. Suddenly, her boy could walk around on his own and enjoy life with other kids, and she even though of sending him to a normal school. But now Phumzile&rsquo;s joy has turned to sadness because Sphiwe Zwane (10) has outgrown his donated legs.And new ones cost more money than Phumzile could ever dream of.She said the pain of seeing her kid no longer jumping around and playing with other kids was becoming unbearable.Sphiwe, from Phumula in Ekurhuleni, enjoyed life for three years while he had the use of artificial legs donated by a Good Samaritan.But now that he has grown a bit, he needs another pair.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a brave kid. He doesn&rsquo;t sit around and watch other children playing. He wants to be part of the fun and loves playing, even though now he has to crawl or walk on his knees,&rdquo; said Phumzile.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if he is in pain, but it kills me inside to watch him suffering like that. &ldquo;When he got his artificial legs he was so proud of being able to do things for himself.&rdquo; Sphiwe cannot live with his parents in Piet Retief, Mpumalanga, as he has to attend a special school in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni. The grade 3 pupil now has to use a wheelchair to get around.&ldquo;It breaks my heart when he asks me when is he going to get new legs.&ldquo;The prosthetic legs have to be replaced every three years so that he can grow normally. The last pair cost R120 000.&rdquo;Phumzile said Sphiwe was born disabled and doctors had to amputate his legs because they wouldn&rsquo;t grow.
