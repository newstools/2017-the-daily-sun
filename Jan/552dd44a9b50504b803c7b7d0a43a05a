I had to dig in all the crops I had planted.”Another resident, Vuyelwa Bikisha (75) said: “I cannot keep my windows open, especially when it’s hot outside, because of the smell caused by the sewage in the streets.” Vuyelwa said the sewage makes it impossible for them to leave their houses as the pool of sewage is in the way. “I am an elderly person. The smell from the sewage spill really affects my health,” she added. Nompumelelo Matshoba also expressed her frustration. She said last week a child almost drowned in the open hole full of sewage.She said residents had reported the matter to the municipality but it has still not been attended to. “Our children could drown in the sewage,” said Nompumelelo. Yoliswa Ramokolo, the Makana Municipality spokeswoman, said that according to the manager dealing with the sewerage problem, the issue had been sorted out last Monday.But when Daily Sun visited the area last Wednesday, raw sewage was still running down the street.
