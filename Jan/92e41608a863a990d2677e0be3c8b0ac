COPS say they are keeping a close watch on Booysens in the west of Tshwane.This comes after a clash between black and white residents over shacks that are being erected on a piece of municipal land. Several people got injured during the battle on Friday evening. At least nine people were admitted to hospital, one in a serious condition.White residents barricaded roads with burning tyres and stones after black residents protested against their white counterparts, whom they said were preventing them from erecting shacks.The black residents said the City of Tshwane relocated them to the area for temporary use until they found a place for them. This comes after their shacks in Jeffsville squatter camp, Atteridgeville were affected by a sinkhole.They erected their shacks on the piece of land on Wednesday and white residents were not happy about it.A shack dweller said: &ldquo;The whites were patrolling the area like we are criminals, saying we&rsquo;d rape and steal from them, and on Friday they finally acted.&rdquo; She said a white man crushed her shack with his car and told them to move out.&ldquo;They started burning the shack. We couldn&rsquo;t let them treat us like that; we had to do something.&ldquo;We fought back by throwing stones at them,&rdquo; she said.Police Captain Kay Makhubela said cops managed to disperse the groups.Municipal spokesman Selby Bokaba said the city began relocating families from Jeffsville whose homes had been affected by a sinkhole to a safe place in Bremer Street.&ldquo;No one has the right to remove the residents from the land because it belongs to the city,&rdquo; he said.
