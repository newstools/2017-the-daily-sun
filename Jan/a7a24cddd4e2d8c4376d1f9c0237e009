THE hard work of pastor David Zondo of Christ the Answer Ministries was recognised at Ndumo, northern KZN, on Tuesday.The 57-year-old man of God received an honorary doctorate from the Good Shepherd College of Religion, Divine Agriculture and Skills Training Centre in Mandeni.The honorary degree is a recognition of his work in healing the sick and assisting the poor. It also recognises his devotion in leading 52 of his church&rsquo;s branches across the African continent.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so humbled and speechless. Such opportunities are very rare. It is true when they say when you do well in front of the world, God lifts you even higher,&rdquo; said Zondo. He said ever since he arrived at Mhlabuyalingana in 2011 and started his church, he has dedicated his life to the people he serves.&ldquo;People continuously flock into my homestead to seek help. I pray for them and they get healed. I help the underprivileged locals, even if it means taking money out of my own pocket,&rdquo; he said.Resident Linah Mzila (56) said she was happy that Zondo was finally getting the honour he deserved.&ldquo;My daughter was so sick and unable to walk when I brought her to Zondo. Today she is in perfect health,&rdquo; she said. Dr Richard Mthembu of the Good Shepherd College praised Zondo for bringing change to the community.
