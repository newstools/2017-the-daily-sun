Then a man removes pastor Andries&rsquo; shoe before the pastor hands it over to the woman to place between her thighs.The woman then falls to the floor with the shoe between her legs.Then another woman appears, saying she went to the bathroom with the first woman. She claims the woman has been healed and will finally be able to sleep with her husband.The woman who was healed can be seen crying as members of the church celebrate.News of this shocking healing method comes a day after Daily Sun wrote an article about Prophet Theo Maseko of Breath of Christ Ministries in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni.Maseko claims to heal people using engine cleaning fluid.
