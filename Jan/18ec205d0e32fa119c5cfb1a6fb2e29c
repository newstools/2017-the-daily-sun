WHEN a neighbour came to her house screaming on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, nothing could prepare Nthabiseng Ndabambi (35) for the terrible news she was about to receive. She was told her husband of nine years, Sergeant Peter Mogotlane (35), had been shot dead at a spaza shop near their home in Winterveld, Tshwane. Peter, who worked for the police&rsquo;s VIP protection unit at the Union Buildings, had just bought four cigarettes when he was attacked. Nthabiseng told Daily Sun that she and her three children (aged between six and 11) were waiting for her husband to return home when they received the devastating news.She said she was shocked when the woman who owns a salon opposite the shop came screaming that Peter was dead. His service pistol, personal documents, bank cards and the bag he took to work every day were taken by the killers. Captain Samuel Sebola said a murder case had been opened but no arrests had been made.
