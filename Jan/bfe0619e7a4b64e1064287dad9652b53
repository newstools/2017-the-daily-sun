Although it was a tough time for her, she learned some important lessons about spending wisely. The former Generations actress says the trick to being in control of your finances is to write down all your spending. “Before you spend anything you must know how much you have. “That means you can avoid spending money you don’t have. “I write down the expenses I have and budget for them,” she said.She added that it’s important to reward yourself, but only when you have been disciplined with your money. “When you’ve been rock bottom you don’t want to go there again.“Life may deal you a better hand, but you know you are still vulnerable. You can always go back to that bad place if you don’t manage and plan well.”She also urged people against building up debt as the consequences can be very damaging in the long term. “Most people think debt is about being broke now. They don’t realise that it changes your entire life going forward.”One of the tips she gave was to have money saved aside for those unexpected expenses that creep up on you.“My income varies from month to month so I save a percentage of my income every month to make sure I have enough,” Lusanda said.
