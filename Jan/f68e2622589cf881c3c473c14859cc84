Ajax Cape Town and Bafana Bafana defender Rivaldo Coetzee is reportedly open to making a move to join Orlando Pirates, as he is eager to follow in Abbubaker Mobara's footsteps.Sport24&nbsp;report that Coetzee has a close relationship with Mobara from their time together at the Urban Warriors, and he would see moving to Bucs as a chance to reunite with his friend and make progress in his career.The news website said: "A source has disclosed to Sport24 that Coetzee would be open to the possibility of joining his "brother" and former central-defensive partner, Mobara at Pirates."The player also would not rule out a move to Europe in the near future. He told&nbsp;KickOff:&nbsp;"I think it's time now, but I don't want to think too much about it. For me now is just to focus on Ajax, and then we'll see."My next step wouldn't be about the money - if they offer me less money in Europe but more in South Africa, I'd still go to Europe."I'd get better as a player and get proper development in Europe as I'm still young, so that counts in my favour. My priority is Europe, but if nothing happens, I'd consider elsewhere in the PSL."The 20-year-old has become a regular starter for both club and country in recent seasons and made history when he became Bafana's youngest debutant at just the age of 17 in 2014 against Congo.
