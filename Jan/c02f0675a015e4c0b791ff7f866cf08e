INDICATIONS are that South African national Under-20 coach Thabo Senong will struggle to get all the players he called up for the upcoming Africa Youth Cup of Nations in Zambia next month.Amajita will start with their first training camp for the championships today and will also play friendlies against Zambia and Mali before the tournament from 26 February to 12 March.Clubs are under no obligation to release their players as the tournament falls outside the Fifa calendar, which could be a problem for coach Senong. The majority of the players will still be engaged in MultiChoice Diski Challenge (MDC) matches in Tsakane and Tshwane this weekend.Bidvest Wits, Ajax Cape Town and SuperSport United are among clubs with three or more players in Senong&rsquo;s squad. Wits, who are still in the MDC title race, told SunSport that they had not made a final decision yet on whether they would release Sanele Shabalala, Reeve Frosler, Givemore Khuphe and Sibongakonke Mbatha to report to Amajita&rsquo;s camp today. Wits chief executive, Jose Ferreira, said: &ldquo;We are still dealing with the issue at the moment.&rdquo;However, the Students&rsquo; MDC coach, Glen Salmon, had mixed feelings regarding the matter: &ldquo;Releasing the players will have positive and negative effects on the team. &ldquo;It might kill our momentum in the MDC, although it&rsquo;s a good experience for the boys to play for the national team.&rdquo;Ajax reserves coach Vladislav Heric said they hadn&rsquo;t decided yet either: &ldquo;We have to support the national team. This is an opportunity for youngsters to get international exposure. So the four players may very well get to go.&rdquo;Struggling SuperSport, who have an injury crisis in their MDC team, have five players in the Amajita squad.Senong has vowed that he will bring the best out of the players he gets: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to dwell on that too much (the player issue). If the players we want don&rsquo;t make it, that will open space for others who are playing in the ABC Motsepe League. &ldquo;I have three weeks to prepare for the competition. I believe we will be ready by the time it starts.&rdquo;
