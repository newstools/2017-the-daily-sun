PUPILS could not use their short cut to school yesterday because a tunnel under the railway line was flooded by heavy rain. Although the depth of the water in the tunnel is unknown, most residents of Kopanong in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria felt it was unsafe to walk through the tunnel.Some parents helped their children to cross the railway because they felt it was unsafe for them to do so on their own.&ldquo;The lives of our children are at risk. &ldquo;They might get killed by a train while crossing the railway,&rdquo; said one parent. No incidents have been reported to the City of Tshwane since the tunnel flooded.Municipal spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the residents of Kopanong are not supposed to walk through the tunnel at all.&ldquo;They should avoid using the tunnel, whether it is blocked or not. It is not safe for them to cross the railway tracks either,&rdquo; he said.
