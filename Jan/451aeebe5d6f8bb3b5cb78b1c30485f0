KZN cops are holding their breath after four colleagues from Umlazi&rsquo;s tactical response team were involved in an accident that killed one of them.&ldquo;Three are still in a bad condition and have not yet been released from intensive care,&rdquo; said Colonel Thembeka Mbhele.The smash happened on the Mangosuthu Highway near Umlazi MegaCity Shopping Mall on Friday night while the officers were on duty.Mbhele told Daily Sun the four police officers were in their service vehicle when their driver allegedly lost control and crashed into a bus.Constable Sbongiseni Nzimande (30) died shortly after the accident. &ldquo;All four were seriously injured but fortunately, the other three survived.&rdquo; The dead cop&rsquo;s brother, Richard Nzimande (50), said funeral preparations were underway.&ldquo;Yesterday, we had to begin by finding the mortuary where his body is kept. If all goes well, we are going to bury him at home at Elandskop, near Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday.&rdquo; Richard said death has robbed his family. &ldquo;Sbongiseni was the only one with a permanent job.&ldquo;We find it very difficult to cope with such a huge loss. Hopefully, in time we are going to be healed. With God, we shall be given strength and means of financial support for the remaining family members.&rdquo; Mhleli Mkhize (29), the dead cop&rsquo;s friend, from KwaNdengezi kasi, said death struck when they least expected it.&ldquo;Sbongiseni was a very good friend.
