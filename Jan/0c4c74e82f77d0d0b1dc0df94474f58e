THE days are numbered for people who dump illegally in Joburg. Michael Sun, the MMC for community safety, has sent a stern warning to residents that city officials will impose heavy punishment for illegal dumpers.He said illegal dumpers have prospered at the expense of the city, the environment and the health of the residents for too long.&ldquo;Some shameless operators charge anything from R600 to R2 000 for a load of waste to be collected and taken care of. This ranges from domestic and garden refuse to building rubble and even toxic waste. &ldquo;But then the waste is dumped in open veld, parks and even into the river system.&rdquo;He said this pollutes the environment and contaminates valuable water resources.&ldquo;Illegal dumping often takes place quickly and it is difficult to catch or trace culprits,&rdquo; said Sun.The MMC said as a step towards ending illegal dumping, the JMPD&rsquo;s By-law Management Unit has initiated a programme which encourages residents to become involved.&ldquo;I ask residents to take action when they see illegal dumping, by taking clear photos showing the culprit, the vehicle with its registration number and the waste dumped.&rdquo;He asked that the photos with the details must be sent to the unit&rsquo;s dedicated officer. &ldquo;We will trace and prosecute the illegal dumpers.&rdquo;He said the most affected areas include Alexandra, Marlboro, Diepsloot, parts of Soweto and Honeydew.Sun said residents are encouraged to send their tip-offs to deputy director Zed Mangaliso on WhatsApp or SMS: 082 779 1361. All tip-offs remain anonymous.
