THE pigs have new neighbours!Yesterday, dozens of pigs were woken by the noise of hammers slamming on to planks.This was because up to 200 people started building shacks on open land next to a pigsty!SInce Friday, a sea of gatvol residents, who were supported by the PAC and the EFF, have been invading open land used by farmers to breed livestock in the KwaKaku bush near Khayelitsha, Uitenhage, in Nelson Mandela Bay.Residents, mostly from wards 43 and 44, have been pushing wheelbarrows and carrying hammers and spades to build shacks, which has led to the pigs running around wide-eyed in their enclosures. The invaders complained that the pigs had access to land and housing while they had been waiting for RDPs for over two decades. When Thembakazi Hlela of the human settlements department arrived with the cops on Friday morning and condemned the invasion, drama erupted. She told the crowd: &ldquo;This land was identified as the site to build 24 000 RDPs but first the land has to be checked for its suitability.&ldquo;The process is still ongoing and the land should be approved first. This land is not ready.&rdquo;That prompted Sanco&rsquo;s Mzwandile Fatman to say: &ldquo;Hlela! I was there in that meeting when you was said you will build 24 000 units and the land must be checked. &ldquo;However, you never told us the timeframe.&rdquo; PAC leader Mbulelo Yawa (32) said: &ldquo;Behind this bush there are shacks and informal settlements called Marikana and Qunu. KwaLanga residents invaded land and yesterday electricity boxes were installed in the area.&ldquo;If they want to check whether this land is suitable, let them check while we are here,&rdquo; they said.
