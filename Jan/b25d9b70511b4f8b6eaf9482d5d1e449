THE Nobebe family is grateful to everyone who supported them in their time of need. Two weeks ago, Nontombi Nobebe&rsquo;s house in Posini, Port Alfred was destroyed by fire.Nontombi (49) said Ndlambe Municipality has since donated a temporary structure, a gel stove and a school uniform to the family. Child Welfare South Africa donated uniforms to the other children in the family, while community members donated a double bed and groceries.&ldquo;Words cannot describe how grateful I am for the help I&rsquo;ve been receiving. I got a temporary structure two days after the incident,&rdquo; she said. Nontombi said they are still trying to work out what caused the fire, which destroyed all their ID books and birth certificates. &ldquo;I went to Home Affairs to see whether I could get the documents for free. &ldquo;Sadly, they said they only do that if more than 10 houses were affected,&rdquo; said Nontombi.However, not all hope is lost, as some church members have promised to assist the family.&ldquo;We received clothes from members of the community and we would like to also thank them for their kindness.&rdquo;Nontombi said she is happy her kids didn&rsquo;t miss any classes because they got their new school uniforms quickly.&ldquo;Their uniforms were the most important things that I was stressing about and I was so relieved when my kids were given them.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Khululekile Mbolekwa said it is the municipality&rsquo;s duty to assist residents in need. He said: &ldquo;The Nobebes are not the only ones who received help. The municipality assists all residents who are in distress.&rdquo;
