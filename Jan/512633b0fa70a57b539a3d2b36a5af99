Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen says that the club have entered into negotiations with Orlando Pirates, with the view of loaning a number of their players.Abafana Bes'thende occupy sixth position in the Premiership table and will look continue their impressive form in the second half of the campaign, potentially aided by bringing in a number of Pirates players on loan.Bucs caretaker coach Augusto Palacios has often fielded a familiar starting line-up for the Soweto giants this season, leaving a number of new signings and squad members sidelined.As a result, Arrows have revealed that they will look to raid the Mayfair-based outfit for players that are out of favour in a bid to strengthen their squad."I know my chairlady (Mato Madlala) has been talking to Orlando Pirates," Larsen told&nbsp;Goal. "I can&rsquo;t divulge any names because you know that there&rsquo;s a lot of competition for players."So, I can&rsquo;t divulge any names in terms of who we are talking to because it might lead other teams to certain players and you&rsquo;ll end up losing out on a player."Larsen also revealed the club's plans to assess forward Mauricio Barrios, in addition to running the rule over two foreign strikers."We are having a look at a few foreign strikers and hopefully by the time the window closes we should have a striker or two to reinforce our front-line," Larsen added."Mauricio is back in Colombia now. The club is still deciding whether to retain or release him. He has struggled to adapt to the South African league."I think where he was playing in Venezuela, the game is a lot more different. A lot slower. I think the pace of the game he struggled to adapt to it and at this stage it looks unlikely that he will continue at the club," he concluded.
