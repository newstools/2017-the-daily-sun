Mamelodi Sundowns defensive midfielder Tiyani Mabunda is optimistic that his side has what it takes to defend the league title, but knows that games in hand are not guaranteed points.Pitso Mosimane's charges, who entered the mid-season break sitting seventh in the Absa Premiership standings, will have a busy February playing catch-up games.Having accumulated 19 points in nine league matches, Downs have six games in hand to finish the Premiership's fist round.The defending league champions will resume their busy schedule with an away encounter against Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr. Molemela Stadium on 8 February."With an experienced and balanced squad we have, I'm much optimistic that we have what it takes to defend our league title," Mabunda told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."However, as much as it is important for us to defend our league title, but one needs to be realistic about the tough challenge we are faced with."Having 6 games in hand means that we will have a very hectic fixture, playing those catch-up games."Yes, on paper it may look like we have an advantage (over fellow opposition teams) with a virtue of having 6 games in hand. But realistically in football games in hand are not guaranteed points."So, we will have to take each game as it comes without putting ourselves under unnecessary pressure," added Mabunda, who was a revelation in Downs' successful CAF Champions League campaign.Downs' six league clashes in February are: Celtic (away, February 8); Chippa United (away, February 14); Platinum Stars (away, February 18); Bidvest Wits (home, February 22); Platinum Stars (home, 25 February); Chippa United (home, 28 February).
