IT WAS a family tradition to go to Durban every year to enjoy the sea. But during her last visit to KZN with her aunt, Kamohelo Mokulubete (15) was swallowed by the waves. The incident, which took place just three days after Christmas, has left the whole family shattered. More than two weeks after she drowned, her body has still not been recovered. When the SunTeam visited the Mokulubete family in Muvhango, near Vanderbijlpark in the Vaal, they said they were heartbroken that Kamohelo was still missing. Her mum, Motlagomang (41) said the teenager loved her aunt and used to look forward to going to the coast with her every year.&ldquo;This was the fourth year she&rsquo;d gone to Durban with her aunt. They always left as soon as the school holidays started. They first went to East London and then travelled to Durban a few days before Christmas,&rdquo; said Motlagomang. &ldquo;She called me the night before the tragedy to say they had made it to Durban safely, and her aunt had bought her a new phone. I didn&rsquo;t know it was the last time I would speak to my child.&rdquo; Kamohelo&rsquo;s gogo, Joyce Mokulubete (65), said they received the tragic news from the girl&rsquo;s aunt. &ldquo;At first we hoped she might still be found, but there has been no trace of her.&rdquo; Joyce said Kamohelo was in the water with her aunt&rsquo;s boyfriend at the time of her disappearance. &ldquo;We always joked about how I was going to live with her when everyone else in the family married,&rdquo; Joyce said. Motlagomang said she hoped the cops would find her daughter&rsquo;s body so they could give her a proper funeral. Cops said they were still searching for the body.
