I should be getting paid for my work,&rdquo; he said.He claimed Dr Malinga doesn&rsquo;t take his calls whenever he tries to contact him.&ldquo;I last saw him on New Year&rsquo;s Day and he asked me why I was wearing old clothes. I told him it was because he owed me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These people should stop playing me. I am not a toy. I&rsquo;m the breadwinner at home. I need money just as much as they do.&rdquo;Dr Malinga told Daily Sun they never discussed payment.He said the reason he put Tsekeleke on the video was to push his career. &ldquo;I saw that he was struggling at Mabopane Taxi Rank so I thought I should help him out,&rdquo; he said.Dr Malinga said the R600 was only to thank him for dancing on the video. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a payment, I was just saying thank you. If we spoke about the money before I would have paid him, but we never spoke about it,&rdquo; he said.
