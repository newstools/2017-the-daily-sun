Municipal manager Nkosiyezwe Vezi confirmed the incident. He said he found Shange in hospital after receiving information about the accident. Vezi said Shange was still in a lot of pain, so he had not been questioned about the allegations yet.&ldquo;I will wait for the report from the deputy mayor once he has recovered and returned to work.&rdquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said there was no record of the accident at the two nearby police stations.
