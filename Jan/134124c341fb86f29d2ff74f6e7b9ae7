WHENEVER it rains, roads in extension 15, Mamelodi East, are washed away. The recent heavy rain has left residents struggling. It has left deep trenches in most roads, with electrical cables and water pipes exposed.Resident Andrew Segodi could not take the mess left by the rain any more.He went to the municipal offices in Denneboom and demanded that the roads be repaired. &ldquo;They sent a truck but it only filled the holes in the main road &ndash; the rest of the streets have big pits waiting to swallow our children,&rdquo; he said. Andrew said they have been reporting the matter to their councillor, Ananias Mogalusi, as well as the municipality but nothing ever happens. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that whenever it rains, the councillor and the municipality expect our calls because with every downpour, a new trench opens.&rdquo; Community leader Karabo Kganyago&rsquo;s house is surrounded by trenches that stop visitors from reaching her home.&ldquo;It is not easy to enter or leave my yard. You have to jump over the pits,&rdquo; she said. She said the trenches also make it difficult for ambulances, school transport and bakeries to access their area.&ldquo;They are a danger to our kids because they play in them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that they will get killed because there are exposed cables in the ditches that could shock them.&rdquo; Mogalusi said they are aware of the problems. &ldquo;I have reported it to the municipality and a spokesman said the area is in the pipeline for development.&rdquo;
