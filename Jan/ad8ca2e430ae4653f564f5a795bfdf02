NOZUKO Nkohlonkohlo (39) from Mfuleni in Cape Town struggled to get a job after her spaza shop burnt down seven years ago. But instead of sitting at home and feeling sorry for herself, the mum of three decided to stand up and do things for herself! She started recycling and collecting rubbish to put food on her table.&ldquo;This is not what I thought I would do at all, but circumstances forced me. It was the easiest way to make money that I could think of. &ldquo;After my spaza shop burnt to ashes in 2010, I was left with nothing. &ldquo;I had to rebuild my house with the money I had been saving all those years.&rdquo; She said she couldn&rsquo;t get a job and she knew that sitting sadly at home wouldn&rsquo;t help her. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t going to bring back what I had lost and was just going to make things worse,&rdquo; said Nozuko.&ldquo;Two years later I decided to start recycling. &ldquo;I have seen people do it before and it didn&rsquo;t look hard.&ldquo;I just go around the community picking up used plastic bottles and sell them. &ldquo;I make sure I wake up early in the morning before the streets are cleaned. &ldquo;I do not make enough, but who is going to give me money if I just sit at home? &ldquo;At least I can make R50 a day and when the days are good, I can make more than that. &ldquo;I have three kids and my relatives are taking care of them while I am trying to get back on my feet again. &ldquo;I still want to reopen my spaza shop, but I don&rsquo;t have the means to do it just now.&rdquo; Nozuko said she has a passion for business. &ldquo;It is what I always wanted to do.&rdquo;
