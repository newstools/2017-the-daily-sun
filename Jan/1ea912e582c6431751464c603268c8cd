A BRAAI is supposed to be peaceful.&nbsp; But the Molefe family of Orange Farm, south of Joburg found themselves in a state of war with a jealous neighbour. It was all because they didn&rsquo;t invite him to their New Year&rsquo;s Day braai!&nbsp; Sitting all alone next door, he heard the laughter and smelled the tasty smoke from the Molefes&rsquo; place.&nbsp; Then he invaded the braai!&nbsp;He allegedly beat up the whole family, smashed their wall with a hammer and broke a sliding door with a huge brick. Emily Molefe told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never feared for my life like this. It was as if the man was possessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were enjoying the first day of the new year on Sunday with a lovely family braai. Then he came and told us we were making a kak braai and he complained about the smoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;We ignored him, as we knew him. We treated him as family and could see he was clearly drunk. We thought he would just sleep it off. &ldquo;But he came back with a hammer, accompanied by two of his friends, and ordered us to turn down the music &ndash;&ensp;or he would do it himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Emily&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Lefuno Mofokeng, confronted the neighbour, all hell broke loose.&nbsp; Lefuno told Daily Sun: &ldquo;He started swearing at everyone. Then he began bashing the wall with a hammer. When I stood up to him, he started attacking me too. &ldquo;He knocked over our braai stand and broke our taps. He threw a brick at me, but I ducked and it hit the sliding door.&rdquo;&nbsp; Police were called to the scene and the suspect was arrested.Orange Farm police spokeswoman Gertrude Makhale said: &ldquo;A case of malicious damage to property has been opened.&nbsp; &ldquo;The suspect has been arrested and is in police custody.&rdquo;
