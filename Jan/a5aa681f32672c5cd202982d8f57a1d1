MATRICULANTS are urged to be vigilant when theY choose a tertiary institution because many private colleges are operating illegally.Dr Shaheeda Essack, director of registrations at the Department of Higher Education and Training, said students needed to get in touch with the department in order to check the accreditation and registration of the colleges they want to attend.They must also check the programmes the colleges offer.Bogus colleges have been found to use a number of methods to mislead the public. Among recent trends identified by the department were online operators committing internet fraud by using the department&rsquo;s name and logo and claiming to offer degrees in 15 days! &ldquo;What we have discovered lately is that these bogus operators come in all forms and shapes,&rdquo; said Essack. &ldquo;For example, most of these private colleges are accredited to offer one qualification but they go on to offer other programmes that the department has not accredited.&rdquo;This means that students who study on these non-accredited programmes will not be able to get a certificate.Essack said that every institution is given a certificate from the department and a certificate from the relevant SETA that has to be displayed in the reception area. If the programme the matriculant is interested in doing does not appear on the certificate, students need to start asking serious questions and contact the department.To verify whether a private college has been registered, students can call the department&rsquo;s toll-free number 0800 87 22 22.
