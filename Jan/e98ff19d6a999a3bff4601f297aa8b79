FIRES are becoming a common feature in communities around the Vhembe area.On New Year&rsquo;s Day, a 10-roomed house at Lufule was reduced to ash when a mysterious fire consumed it.This weekend another fire gutted a Bible School in Malamulele, leaving damage estimated at about R2 million. Scores of theology students, grade 12 pupils and youth from around the area were hard hit when the Harvesters Theological Seminary, formerly known as Harvest Bible College, in Xithlelani Village caught fire.The incident happened on Sunday afternoon and burned the centre down. The billowing smoke could be seen kilometres away.According to a witness, the fire is suspected to have been caused by an electrical fault and started in the kitchen. Dennis Soares, resident pastor and school principal, said he was in church when he received a call informing him of the fire.&ldquo;I had to rush off and leave the service but when I got there, firefighters were already trying to douse the flames. Sadly they ran out of water. We had to watch helplessly as the flames consumed the school.&rdquo;Board member Sophie Chabalala described the loss as a blow to the whole community. &ldquo;We had a library here with many books. But we have the Lord to thank as we managed to rescue most of them.&rdquo;Warrant Officer Alson Mapindani, Malamulele police spokesman, said the fire has not yet been reported to them.
