TOP COP, Nathi Nhleko, seems to be starring in a papgeld drama!But Minister of Police Nhleko has denied skipping maintenance payment for the child he has with his estranged wife.In July last year, Sunday Sun reported that Nhleko had booted his wife, Nothando Nkomo, out of their KZN home in KwaDlangezwa.And we can today reveal that Nothando took the police minister to Empangeni Maintenance Court on 18 December.Sunday Sun sources claim Nothando took him to court because Nhleko last paid maintenance for their child last year in September.Sources claim that the police minister used to buy S26 baby formula and a single pack of 50 nappies.&ldquo;Those things cost R500. So it&rsquo;s surprising that Nathi isn&rsquo;t paying child maintenance.&ldquo;They may have their differences, but that doesn&rsquo;t give him the right to neglect his child.&ldquo;He knows Nothando is unemployed. Baby formula only lasts a week &ndash; and when she calls, he either ignores her or tells Nothando she should prioritise some other things,&rdquo; claimed the source.Another mole alleged that Nhleko last bought clothes for the baby when she was six-month-old.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Nothando is asking him to love the child. But she wants him to take full responsibility of his child.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen someone so wealthy and well-respected behaving like him. Nathi has abused that woman.&ldquo;He forced her to quit her job in Durban and then after a year into their marriage he started humiliating her in public.&ldquo;He ordered cops to kick her out of their home. The law should take its course and force him to pay maintenance for their child,&rdquo; the source said.Nothando confirmed that she had taken Nhleko to court.&ldquo;I have no choice. I can&rsquo;t be struggling with our child when he&rsquo;s working and earning a good salary.&ldquo;He may hate me, but he must take full responsibility for our child because I&rsquo;m unemployed,&rdquo; she said.Nhleko and Nothando got married in 2014 in a traditional ceremony held at the University of Zululand in KwaDlangezwa.When asked to comment, Nhleko said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;m not aware of that matter. I support all my kids. There&rsquo;s no kid of mine I&rsquo;m not supporting.&rdquo;
