Cruz said he decided to involve police because of Emtee&rsquo;s rage on the voicemail.Cruz added: &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;s willing to pay or do anything to come after me, so I better hide my ass.

I want the public to know who&rsquo;s responsible, if anything happens to me.&rdquo;Another sources said the drama dates back when the pair used to work together in Town Domore studios as recording artists. According to Cruz Afrika things went sour when their mutual friend producer Swati died and it was alleged that he was poisoned by one of the associates in the Records stable. &ldquo;I was very close to Swati and their behaviour after his death became too suspect,&rdquo; Cruz said.

He said two hours after dropping the diss track, Emtee had been calling him non stop. &ldquo;I dropped the diss track at 2am and he called me from 4am until around 6am and I wasn&rsquo;t answering his calls.&rdquo; Edenvale police confirmed they are investigating a case of intimidation, but said no one has been arrested yet.Emtee said: &ldquo;I was called by the police, asking me to hand myself over. I won&rsquo;t do that because I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have friends because he f**ks up every relationship he has. He was a back-up dancer for the Mahotella Queens, I wasn&rsquo;t even born at the time. I don&rsquo;t want to get arrested for beating up an elderly person.&rdquo;
