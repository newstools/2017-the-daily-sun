ALL they&rsquo;ve learnt in &ldquo;big school&rdquo; so far is hardship.The grade 1 class at Malepelepe Junior Secondary School in Tsolo, Mthatha found themselves sitting on the floor because there is no furniture.The 308 pupils use mismatched furniture lent to them by other schools, or sit on the floor.Principal Noziphiwo Twetwa said the school, established in the late 70s, has never had new furniture.&ldquo;We have written countless letters to the provincial education department. They always say an assessor will visit our school.&rdquo;She said it wasn&rsquo;t uncommon to have more than 90 pupils from grade R to grade 7 in one classroom. &ldquo;The progress and performance of our pupils is affected. Kneeling on a cement floor for long hours is not healthy,&rdquo; said Twetwa.She said when she arrived at the school in 2014, she applied for furniture.&ldquo;In the meantime we went to other nearby schools and borrowed desks and chairs from them. SGB chairman and parent, madala David Nomakethe, said he was worried about their kids&rsquo; future.&ldquo;We feel neglected by government because we are in remote villages.&rdquo; Eastern Cape Education department spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said &ldquo;We must apologise to our pupils who find themselves in this situation. We realise there are schools falling through the cracks and we are in the process of issuing tenders. &ldquo;We want to make sure our commitment as national and provincial education departments are carried out and that our pupils receive appropriate furniture.&rdquo;
