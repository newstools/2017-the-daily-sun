HE BECAME a single father when his baby mama left him literally holding the baby.The boy was only three weeks old.And now Bakoena Mosena from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, is desperately looking for the mother of his son.The 37-year-old told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We did not have a fight, and I never suspected she would do such a thing. &ldquo;I just think she was angry because I was chilling with friends when she wanted me around.&rdquo;Bakoena said the boy&rsquo;s mum called him several times on the day she disappeared, telling him to come back home. &ldquo;I was chilling a couple of houses from home and did not think it would be a problem because she knew where I was. I answered all her calls and reassured her that I was still around.&rdquo;Bakoena said he came home at 11pm and found his son on the bed. &ldquo;She was gone . . . she took everything that belonged to her. She didn&rsquo;t even leave a note. &ldquo;I was panicking and went to ask neighbours if they had seen her. One of the neighbours told me that she left at 10pm,&rdquo; he said.Bakoena said he went to the woman&rsquo;s family, but they had no idea where she was. &ldquo;All I want from her is my son&rsquo;s birth certificate because she left with all his documents. I only managed to get the clinic card.&ldquo;Social workers have asked me to get an article published so they can see that I am genuine and honest about not knowing the baby mama&rsquo;s whereabouts.&ldquo;They said they will help me afterwards. I hope she sees this article, wherever she is, and brings the child&rsquo;s certificate,&rdquo; said the desperate dad.
