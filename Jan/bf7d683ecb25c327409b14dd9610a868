The 31st edition of the tournament gets under way in Gabon on Saturday, with the final at Stade d&rsquo;Angondj&eacute; Stadium scheduled for 5 February.Ivory Coast, Ghana, Senegal and Algeria are some of the teams expected to make an impact in this year&rsquo;s showpiece.Arsenal midfielder, Ismael Bennacer, will be the youngest player this year. The 19-year-old, yet to make his Premier League debut, was named in the Algeria squad.Seven-time Afcon champions, Egypt, are back in full force in this year&rsquo;s competition. The Pharaohs have not been part of the tournament since 2010., Ivory Coast The reigning champions will begin their quest to defend their title, won two years back in Equatorial Guinea.The African powerhouse will be making their 21st appearance in the competition.Ivory Coast has won this competition two times &ndash; in 1992 and 2015.But their performance is the hardest to predict, as they&rsquo;ll be playing in this competition for the first time without Yaya Toure, who has been one of their most influential players., Algeria After their successful World Cup, Algeria gained respect and were once again considered as one of the best teams in Africa.The side has young and exciting players who ply their trade for top teams in Europe.The Desert Foxes are coming to the Afcon games with the best attacking record, having scored 25 goals in six qualifying games.The team has been pitted against tough rivals in Group B, where we are going to witness a North Africa Derby between Algeria and Tunisia. The group also features Zimbabwe and Senegal., GhanaThe Black Stars of Africa are going into the tournament with the best chance of making a good impression, having reached the finals of the competition in 2015, when they lost to Ivory Coast on penalties.Ghana have a strong squad of powerful and skilful players to call on, and have shown no sign of division, which had caused them trouble in past campaigns.,&nbsp; SenegalThe Lions of Teranga are one of the teams that have never won the Afcon. They were once in the final in 2002 in Mali, where they lost 3-2 to Cameroon on penalties after playing a goalless draw.The much-improved Senegal are among favourites in this year&rsquo;s edition, as they have assembled a strong squad that is expected to cause a lot of havoc in their group.This team managed to record six out of six victories in the Afcon qualifiers. Midfielder&nbsp;Sadio Mane is one of&nbsp;the players who are expected to play an important role in this&nbsp;team.
