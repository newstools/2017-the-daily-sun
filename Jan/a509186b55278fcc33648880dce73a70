MANY schools across Mzansi celebrated their year-end matric 2016 pass rates.&nbsp; But at some schools the release of the matric results was met with shock as not a single matric pupil managed to pass! Principals of the underperforming schools will have to explain their failure to produce any positive results to the department of education. - In Gauteng, the department is considering closing down three schools. The department said nine schools performed poorly and that three of these had a 0% pass rate.&nbsp; The department said it would ensure that the schools accounted for their poor performances. &ldquo;The schools will be required to make representations to department head, Edward Mosuwe, as to why their registration should not be withdrawn within 30&thinsp;days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Based on that, he will then make a decision whether to close the school or not,&rdquo; the statement reads. The province had recorded a pass rate of 84,22% in the grade 12 examinations, compared to 84,69% in 2015. - The Limpopo Education Department said it saw a need to merge some of its underperforming schools after several 0% pass rates. Curriculum manager Onicca Dederen said these schools all had a very low pupil enrolment. &ldquo;The trend with schools with very low enrolment is that they perform poorly, hence the necessity to merge these schools,&rdquo; she said. - In KZN, 14 schools got a 0% pass, with five being in the uMgungundlovu District. KZN Education spokesman, Sihle Mlotshwa, said the matter would not be taken lightly and principals of these schools would have some explaining to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will zoom in on these schools to correct the situation and help them along the way,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; &ldquo;We also plan to have surprise visits at these schools to witness their culture and ethos first-hand. &ldquo;We are very disappointed with the non-performance of these schools.&nbsp; &ldquo;The principals of these schools need to explain exactly what happened,&rdquo; he said.
