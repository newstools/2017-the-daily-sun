Someone should have been with her.&rdquo;Another resident blamed the community for not taking care of their neighbours.&ldquo;Gogo Mmamojalefa was not supposed to die of starvation. Residents knew she was locked up, but they did nothing,&rdquo; she said.Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza visited the family yesterday.She said it was unacceptable that a gogo had been left to fend for herself until her last breath.&ldquo;I am struggling to come to terms with this. &ldquo;The department will give the gogo a decent funeral.&rdquo;
