THEY call him the pepper spray rapist.That is because many women have fallen victim to a man who pepper sprays them before dragging them into the bushes and raping them.Tembisa police spokeswoman, Constable Patricia Mgijima, said the man approaches unsuspecting women and promises them jobs in the private and government sectors.&ldquo;The suspect approaches women walking alone in malls and other public places like taxi ranks.&ldquo;He tells the women about the job, then pretends to call the supervisor of the company and says he can bring the woman to them immediately.&rdquo;Once the women are convinced, he goes with them in to the bushes. &ldquo;Then he sprays pepper spray on a woman, overpowers her, ties her up and rapes her. &ldquo;He then robs his victims of their valuables,&rdquo; said Mgijima.A woman from Alexandra, north of Joburg, was on her way to Kempton Park when she fell victim to the rapist.The suspect also lured a woman to a spot behind the Oakmoor Train Station before he attacked her.Another woman was on her way to look for a job in Kempton Park when the man approached her.&ldquo;As they were approaching the train station, he suggested they take a taxi. On the way to the taxi rank, he pepper sprayed her, raped her and robbed her of her money and cellphone,&rdquo; said Mgijima.Mgijima said cops are investigating eight different cases of rape.Police are appealing to members of the community to be on the lookout for a man lingering around train stations.
