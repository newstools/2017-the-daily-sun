GOITSASIWANG was tired of the abusive relationship and wanted to end things!But the 34-year-old from Meadowlands in Soweto did not want to break up with her boyfriend over the phone. She wanted to do things properly, by telling him face to face. That decision proved deadly.On Saturday, she was allegedly stabbed seven times with a screwdriver by her abusive and jealous boyfriend. According to Goitsasiwang Sehako&rsquo;s father, Lazarus Sehako (57), he last saw his daughter on Friday. &ldquo;She came back last Friday beaten black and blue and told me she officially wanted to leave her boyfriend.&rdquo; Lazarus told Daily Sun he had a very close relationship with his daughter.&ldquo;My daughter and I had an inseparable father and daughter bond. &ldquo;We shared everything and she told me all that was going on in her life. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe how evil this man is. When my daughter first introduced him to me he seemed like a decent guy. &ldquo;Little did I know he would be the one to take her life.&rdquo;Lazarus said the two had been dating for eight years and in 2012, moved in together to a flat in Newlands, Joburg. This was where she was killed.&ldquo;That is when my daughter started to see his true colours. He was abusive and would often beat her up really badly. &ldquo;She would come back badly bruised and I would tell her to leave him but my pleas fell on deaf ears.&ldquo;But just before her death she told me she had met someone and wanted to end things with him,&rdquo; said shocked Lazarus.Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed the incident. He said police are investigating a case of murder and said the suspect has been arrested and is in police custody.
