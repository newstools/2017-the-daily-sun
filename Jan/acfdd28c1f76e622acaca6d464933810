THE RACE for the Absa Premiership is wide open!Kaizer Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung believes his rejuvenated side can win the championship.Said Motaung: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it. We are one point behind the leaders. Apart from Mamelodi Sundowns who have games in hand, anybody in the top five at present could win the league. That&rsquo;s what makes this season so interesting and exciting.&ldquo;We have two goals in the second round. We are challenging for the league and the Nedbank Cup.&rdquo;What has given Motaung encouragement is the fact Amakhosi collected seven points from their last three fixtures in December, including wins over Polokwane City and Golden Arrows to end 2016.Said Motaung: &ldquo;The turnaround at the end of the year has given the players inspiration and motivation. We believe we can achieve our goals. We are still in with a chance.&rdquo;Amakhosi are on 24 points, one behind the three leaders, SuperSport United, Bidvest Wits and Cape Town City.Motaung also said he would be signing a player from outside Mzansi ahead of tomorrow night&rsquo;s transfer deadline and could be releasing players not needed by head coach Steve Komphela.Said Motaung: &ldquo;We will make an announcement on players either on Monday or Tuesday.&rdquo;Motaung also shrugged off reports that Downs have snatched Ivory Coast born trialist, defender Ismael Olivier Toure, who failed his trial at Chiefs and was sent home last weekend.Troure failed to get on his flight, however, and is apparently training with the PSL and African champions.Said Motaung: &ldquo;I was looking for a left-sided defender. &ldquo;He was not what we wanted and we sent him home, releasing him back to his club in Ivory Coast. We took him to the airport and he disappeared. &ldquo;He acted unprofessionally. He is not our player or our concern.&rdquo;
