Liverpool frontman Daniel Sturridge insists he has "pushed himself to the limit" this season despite featuring sparingly, and is adamant he is the best striker at the club.The 27-year-old has made just seven starts under manager Jurgen Klopp in the Premier League this season, with a further nine appearances coming from the substitutes bench.His lack of regular playing time has once again raised question marks over his fitness and injury record in recent years, but the Birmingham-born player says he does not hold a grudge against the German tactician."I believe I'm the best striker Liverpool has," Sturridge told&nbsp;Sky Sports. "That's my opinion."But the manager and everything else is entitled to their opinion as well."It's the manager who picks the team so if in that specific game, he doesn't feel I'm the best striker for the job, that's his decision."You have to take it on the chin, I can't be upset about it. You have to take the rough with the smooth in football, you can't take things personally."He added: "I've played many games for Liverpool Football Club."I feel like last season I played a lot of games for the club, I finished top scorer in all competitions."It's not about whether you're injured or not, it's about when you're on the pitch what you do."You want to be available for every single game. Every player wants to play, every player wants to be successful."But there's times when you're not fit, and it's how you bounce back from that, how you come out of that, it's how you rebound and put yourself out there on the football pitch."Every player wears their heart on their sleeve in terms of they'll battle through injuries. I've played with injuries before - knocks, tears, everything."It's about pushing yourself to your limits for the club and I feel I've done that."Sturridge, who has just two Premier League goals to his name this season, will be hoping for a starting berth in Sunday's highly-anticipated clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford.
