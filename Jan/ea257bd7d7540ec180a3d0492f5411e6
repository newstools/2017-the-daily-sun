A SHOP owner and his landlord in Hebron outside Mabopane, north of Tshwane, live in fear.This is after bullets flew wildly during an early morning robbery at a local spaza shop last week. To date, no arrests have been made.Five unknown men reportedly stormed into the shop at about 1am while everyone was sleeping.They broke into the shop by using a hammer to knock a hole in the wall.Spaza shop owner Samaling Tessema (25) said he thought he was going to die when he heard the thugs breaking in with the hammer.&ldquo;I knew they were coming for me when I heard my first bedroom chain break,&rdquo; he said.He said he knew they wanted money, so he threw cash at them.&ldquo;Before they could ask for it, I threw all the money I had at them just to save my life,&rdquo; he said.Samaling&rsquo;s landlord, Simon Mamadi (48), said while he was sleeping with his wife they heard noise and when they went out to see what was happening, one of the thugs shot at them.&ldquo;He first shot at the sky and then at our bedroom, the bullet went through the wall, but fortunately it didn&rsquo;t hit anyone,&rdquo; he said.He said the thugs fired two more shots after they went back inside the house.Simon said he called his neighbour, who in turn called the police.&ldquo;I was scared. I thought they were going to come into the house and kill my wife and I,&rdquo; he said.He said four men were in the shop and one was patrolling the yard.&ldquo;We were helpless for hours. I am sure neighbours heard gunshots, but they were too scared to come out.&rdquo;He said he was happy that no one was hurt.North West police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Moleko said a case of business burglary had been opened.&ldquo;There are no arrests yet, but the investigation is still under way.&rdquo;
