THE relegation-haunted Magesi FC have cleared away deadwood in their squad to create space for new signings in their quest for survival. Magesi had a dismal first round in the National First Division (NFD), winning only two of the 15 matches played, leaving them at the foot of the table.With the player transfer window closing tonight, many NFD clubs will be finalising deals to make sure they have enough players for the second round. Magesi chief executive John Mathibe confirmed that they had terminated the contracts of some ineffective players. Players who have been released are Temptation Chiwunga, Mzwakhe Mthimkhulu, Motshoshi Baloyi, Patrick Meso, Bonginkosi Hlophe, Kenneth Lesia, Khutso Mohwatseleng and Francious Baloyi.Said Mathibe: &ldquo;We need players who will add value to the club, players who will help us move up from where we are in the log standings.&rdquo;Log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu did not make any major signings. They have only confirmed three new additions in Nkosinathi Zitha, Philani Cele and Thabiso Nkoana. Real Kings, who are also in their first season in the NFD, released 11 players and roped in five &ndash; Mxolisi Sibanyoni, Sphesihle Nzimande, Reabatsoe Rakoti, Siyabonga Shoyisa and the returning Thobani Kunene, on loan from Platinum Stars.
