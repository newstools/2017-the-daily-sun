Dear MizzbI wrote my matric exams, but due to poor choices I had tattoos done on visible parts of my body. This turned out to be a bad choice, because the army rejected my application after they saw my tattoos. I cannot remove the tattoos because it is expensive to do so. Please help me.AnonymousDear AnonymousYou sound like you are in a very tight spot. It is important for young people to remember that the decisions they make today will affect their future. Have you considered using make-up to hide your tattoos? You could visit your nearest pharmacy or tattoo parlour and ask them if they have any make-up. Alteratively, you can invest in clothing to cover up the tattoos. The important thing to remember is that you only have one body, so take good care of it.
