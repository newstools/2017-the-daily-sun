IT WAS supposed to be a day of joy for Zanele Nkosi, but it turned into a day of tears when heartless thugs robbed her of her registration fee.The 18-year-old from Newcastle, KZN got up early on Monday to go to Durban University of Technology to find out if her registration for a national diploma in business management had been accepted.In her bag she had a sealed envelope with R3 500 in cash, money her dad raised by selling his only cow.A sobbing Zanele said: &ldquo;I was standing at a robot when a man came up to me, greeted me, tapped me on the arm and walked off.&ldquo;Seconds later, a woman came and told me the man had smeared something like vaseline on my arm.&rdquo; The woman &ndash; who seemed very sympathetic &ndash; removed the ointment from her arm with a rusty 5c coin.&ldquo;A few minutes later I checked my money and found unused lottery tickets inside. &ldquo;The envelope was sealed when I left home in the morning. My dad sold the cow because my family wanted me to go to varsity.&rdquo;Police spokesman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele advised students that they should not carry cash as they are a prime target during this time of year.Sazi Mhlongo , president of the South African Traditional Healers&rsquo; Association, said there is magic muthi that criminals use to take money from their victims without even opening their bags.
