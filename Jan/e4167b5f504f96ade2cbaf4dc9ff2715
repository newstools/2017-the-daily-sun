STEPPING on someone else&rsquo;s foot in a tavern can be deadly. That&rsquo;s the hard lesson Ephraim Mahlaola learned after being beaten by four men in a tavern until he collapsed. Ephraim (24) from block CV, Mabopane near Tshwane was&nbsp;attacked on Sunday evening. He now has a sore body and an open wound to the head.Ephraim said he went to the Winterveld tavern near his home for a few drinks. &ldquo;When I got there, a man accused me of stepping on his foot, even though he was far away from me.&ldquo; I think he has a grudge. I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but it&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s a problem,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;After one or two drinks, the guy pushed me and said I&rsquo;d stepped on his foot.&ldquo;I apologised because I don&rsquo;t like fighting, even though I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Ephraim said.But the man claimed Ephraim had stepped on his takkies five times! &ldquo;Out of nowhere, three more men joined my attacker and beat me till I collapsed. It was like I stole something! &ldquo;People were surprised because I&rsquo;m a peaceful guy and would never hurt a fly. &ldquo;I thought I was going to die and when I woke up I had alcohol all over my body,&rdquo; he said.He laid an assault charge against the man at Loate Police station.SAPS spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said a case of assault was opened, adding: &ldquo;No arrest has been made yet and the case is under investigation.&rdquo;
