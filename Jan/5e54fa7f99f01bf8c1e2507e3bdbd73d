THE moving of certain classes from Alexandra to Ellis Park resulted in early morning protest action by Johannesburg Central College students and local community members, Nehawu said today."Our provincial leadership is still going there to assess the situation. From what I gather from our people on the ground, students are [protesting] because the college is moving some courses from Alexandra to Ellis Park," National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union national spokesman Khaya Xaba said.Protesters blocked London Road and 13th Avenue earlier in the day after burning tyres, trees and trash, authorities said.Xaba said the moving of courses to Ellis Park would have dire consequences for students from Alexandra."It means they will have fork out transport money. We are supporting the community in their protest. We support their view. It is a bad economy and now people will have to find more money."Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the protest had calmed down since the morning."The situation is calm. Protesters and management will be meeting to discuss the issues surrounding the protest. There are no reported injuries or damage to property."The college is a public institution, with campuses around Johannesburg, including Alexandra, Langlaagte, and Parktown. It offers qualifications, including NQF levels two to four, skills courses and learnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/moving-college-classes-sparks-protests-in-alexandra-20170116&nbsp;
