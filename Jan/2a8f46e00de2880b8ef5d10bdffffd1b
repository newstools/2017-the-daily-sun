Hey fashion! It's time to retire some of your old ways and move forward. Here are 6 trends you should seriously consider retiring in the new year.1.Dramatic fringe We all love fringes on our skirts, shoes and &nbsp;purses but let's not go for over the top, exaggerated ones.Photo from instagram (@bagcrush_est2015)2. Fitness trackers If you want to live a healthier life then drink more water, eat healthy and exercise, but If you want to waste your money on a hideous bracelet that ruins your outfit then get a fitness tracker. Besides no one really cares if you're counting your steps or not.Photo from instagram (@kimberlyduncan716)3. Corsets aka waist trainers The Kardashians made this trend popular with their constant Instagram posts showing their hour glass figures in their corsets. They are designed to enhance (or rather exaggerate) your figure. It has also been said that they can cause internal organ damage, so no thanks.&nbsp;Photo from instagram (@zetacurves) 4. Bright coloured/patterned tights&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t even know why these are &nbsp;produced in adult sizes. Whoever thought that they would flatter any human's legs was mistaken.&nbsp;Photo from instagram (@dreamleggings)6. Dungarees Rather go for a jumpsuit, its cuter. Unless you work on a farm.
