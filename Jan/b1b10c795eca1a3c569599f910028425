POLICE have dismissed the DA&rsquo;s report on acting national police commissioner General Khomotso Phahlane.Police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said the forensic audit report into Phahlane was even presented to a parliamentary ad hoc committee.&ldquo;This is a complete forensic audit report, done after allegations against Phahlane by the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union. &ldquo;The allegations were found to be baseless,&rdquo; added De Beer.But DA shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele admitted it was the same report released last year. He argued that the general only released a summary and not the full report.He also admitted that the report could not find any evidence to support the allegations by the union, but said certain questions and doubts remained. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we want it investigated,&rdquo; Mbhele said.De Beer yesterday said the DA was more than welcome to submit the report to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate to form part of its ongoing investigation into Phahlane.
