FORMER Golden Arrows head coach Mark Harrison has been appointed as the new technical director of struggling Baroka FC.Harrison&rsquo;s appointment was confirmed by Bakgaga chairman Khurishi Mphahlele yesterday, who also denied speculation that head coach Kgoloko Thobejane had been fired. Baroka ended the first round of the Absa Premiership at the bottom of the standings with 14 points from 15 matches. Thobejane had bragged at the beginning of the season after winning promotion from the National First Division that his side would win the league title and all cup competitions. But the outspoken coach has been brought down to earth.Said Mphahlele: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t fired the coach (Thobejane), instead we brought in Harrison as our technical director. He will also serve as Thobejane&rsquo;s assistant. &ldquo;We have not been scoring enough goals, which has been a concern. As the second round approaches we now know what to expect and believe Harrison will be a big help. We have a better idea on how to approach our games.&rdquo;The former Stoke City goalkeeper has also coached Mpumalanga Black Aces, Chippa United, and Township Rollers in Botswana.The Limpopo based Bakgaga have been struggling to find the back of the net since the beginning of the season, having netted just 12 times in their 15 matches as they prop up the Absa Premiership table.Early last month they roped in former Bloemfontein Celtic and Orlando Pirates striker Helder Pelembe as well as Siphamandla Sangweni, who had helped the club win promotion last season while on loan from Pirates.
