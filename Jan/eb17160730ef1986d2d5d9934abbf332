THE BATTLE for the remaining Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) Group B quarterfinal slot will reach fever pitch tonight with Mzansi&rsquo;s neighbours Zimbabwe, Tunisia and Algeria all in the running.Group leaders Senegal are already through and will be holding the cards tonight (9pm), as the outcome of their match will determine who makes it into the quarters.Algeria and Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Warriors are third and fourth respectively with a point apiece, while Tunisia are second, two points ahead of the other two ahead of the decisive matches to be played simultaneously in Franceville and Libreville.The Warriors face stingy Tunisia, a shoe-in for the quarters as things stand, while Senegal will aim to keep their clean record against a desperate Algeria.Warriors coach Kalisto Pasuwa, whose charges were unlucky in their two matches, said they would up the tempo in their quest for a quarterfinal berth.Pasuwa blamed individual errors for their loss to Senegal and 2-2 draw with Algeria: &ldquo;We learned some things that we will take into the game against Tunisia,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It is not over for us yet. We have done our homework and you can expect a different Zimbabwe side. We have rectified all the wrongs.&rdquo;WHAT ZIMBABWE NEED TO DO TO QUALIFY:Zimbabwe must beat Tunisia by three goals without conceding and hope Senegal beat Algeria, which will leave the Warriors in a position to qualify as Group B runners-up.
