The Chiefs have apologised after some of the teams' players allegedly verbally abused traffic wardens after a team practice.New Zealand media reported that the players reacted obscenely after being given parking tickets from two female traffic wardens.The Chiefs then released a statement on Thursday speaking about the matter."The team were at a training yesterday at a public park where some team members had parked vehicles that received parking tickets," the statement read."The majority of players had travelled by bicycle and the Hamilton City Council has raised with us that inappropriate comments were made as some were leaving voicing frustration at the situation."The team has been questioned today and say that while the comments were not directed at the parking wardens, they apologise sincerely for any distress caused to the wardens involved."The Chiefs have been in discussions with Hamilton City Council and wholeheartedly support them in their stance against poor behaviour toward any of their staff."This is just the latest in alleged sexism stemming from the Chiefs players after last year a stripper was reportedly groped by the players at an end of year function.
