JABULILE Maphanga from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni is a troubled woman. The 29-year-old has an undiagnosed skin condition that she says makes her look like a cobra. Jabulile told Daily Sun she&rsquo;s done everything possible to get medical help but has had no luck. She now wants a strong inyanga who can heal her as she&rsquo;s convinced she is cursed.Jabulile said it all started in 2014 after she came back from a funeral in KwaNdebele. &ldquo;On my way back I noticed two itchy lumps on my neck. I did not pay much attention as I thought the problem might have been caused by the water there.&rdquo; But when her entire body started to itch she went to see a doctor, who gave her antibiotics. But, said Jabulile, they didn&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;I then decided to go to hospital and the doctors there suspected I might have TB. I was tested but my results came back negative. &ldquo;I was also tested for skin cancer and transferred to Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria to undergo chemotherapy.&rdquo; Jabulile said instead of improving, her condition deteriorated to where she couldn&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;I was taken off chemo and kept under observation at the hospital. &ldquo;One day I woke up and was shocked by what I saw. I now look like a cobra. My neck has swollen and taken the shape of a cobra&rsquo;s head. My skin is forever itchy.&rdquo; Inyanga Nonsikazi Mkhize said there is a snake curse but it is from inside out and isn&rsquo;t easy to reverse.Dr Thabiso Motloung said there are a lot of skin conditions and diseases that could cause skin to itch. &ldquo;I would have to see the patient first to give a diagnosis.&rdquo;
