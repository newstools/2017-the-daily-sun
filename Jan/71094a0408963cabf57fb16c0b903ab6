BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt has attracted admirers on the SA Football Association technical committee, who will be heading the search for a new coach for the senior national team.Safa sacked head coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba in December and is looking to find a timely replacement ahead of Bafana Bafana&rsquo;s Africa Cup of Nations and African Nations Championship qualifier in March. He was dismissed after being charged with gross misconduct, insubordination and violating Safa&rsquo;s communication policy. Mashaba threw a tantrum after Bafana&rsquo;s crucial victory over Senegal in a World Cup qualifier in Limpopo in November. Mashaba is fighting back and has directed his legal team to take the matter to the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. He has vowed to go all the way to get reinstated or compensation as a last resort. A member of the Safa technical committee said they would meet early next week when the offices officially reopen.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we meet as early as possible. There&rsquo;s a crucial match in March and we need to have finalised the new technical team. &ldquo;We have identified a few individuals and Gavin Hunt is one of them. Hunt is Danny Jordaan&rsquo;s favourite at the moment and that gives him a slight inside track,&rdquo; said the source.But what may count against Hunt is his rather not-so-comprehensive experience in African competitions. Safa will be looking for someone who has done well on the continent. This gives Pitso Mosimane, Roger de Sa and Eric Tinkler a head start.&ldquo;We do not want an overseas person who has no clue about the African continent. &ldquo;Pitso has won the Caf Champions League, and Tinkler and De Sa have been to finals of major competitions on the continent. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of profile we&rsquo;re looking for. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that Hunt is out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very successful coach locally and has won major accolades,&rdquo; the source added.Hunt has won four PSL Coach of the Year awards and bagged the PSL title three times with SuperSport United. Efforts to reach the Wits coach yesterday were not successful. When he was asked about the Bafana job last year, he said: &ldquo;It (my name) was linked the last time&sbquo; and the time before and the time before. I can&rsquo;t . . . I&rsquo;ve got a contract and I&rsquo;m very happy. &ldquo;But anyway &ndash; no. I&rsquo;m very happy and I will continue working here (at Wits).&rdquo;
