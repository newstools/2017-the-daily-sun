DESPITE being in the last six months of his contract with Lamontville Golden Arrows, captain Matome Mathiane says he is 100% committed to his duties. The defender has seen limited game-time in the first round of Absa Premiership, playing in just five matches. Though Mathiane would not talk contract matters with SunSport, he was eager to share his plans for his last six months at Arrows. &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t say much about the first round. I only played five matches, covering for injuries or suspensions to (Limbikani) Mzava and (Nkanyiso) Mngwengwe,&rdquo; he said. Mathiane, who captained Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende when they gained promotion back to the Absa Premiership two years ago, said even though he only had six months left on his contract with the club, he wanted to make them memorable. &ldquo;My commitment to the team is still there and it will remain. My aim is to play more matches than I did in the first round. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m not that far down the pack. The only guys who are above me are Mzava and Mngwengwe. But I&rsquo;m willing to work harder than before to get my chance,&rdquo; added Mathiane. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende will begin their preparations for the final 15 matches of Absa Premiership and Nedbank Cup today. In their first 15 matches they were able to collect 20 points and ended the first round in sixth position in the league table. They have won five, drawn five and lost five. Their first league match of the new year will see them take on SuperSport United at Lucas Masterpieces Moripe Stadium on 8 February. The teams played to a 1-1 draw at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu in the first round.
