Proteas fast bowler Lungi Ngidi has been ruled out of the ODI series against Sri Lanka with a left abdominal muscle wall injury.Ngidi sustained the injury during the third T20 international against Sri Lanka at Newlands on Tuesday and will need 3-4 weeks to recover.&nbsp;"Lungi landed awkwardly on his left hip while fielding during the 3rd&nbsp;T20 International against Sri Lanka on Tuesday,"&nbsp;Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee said."Subsequent scans confirmed an abdominal muscle wall tear which will rule him out for 3-4 weeks. It is a sensitive injury because the abdominal wall is highly loaded during the fast-bowling action so full recovery is important before he can resume bowling at 100% match intensity."He will follow a thorough rehab and treatment plan to give him the best opportunity to return to full fitness." &nbsp;Ngidi&rsquo;s availability for selection for the latter part of the ODI series against New Zealand will be subject to him passing the required return-to-play protocol.&nbsp;Ngidi will not be replaced in the squad.Sport24
