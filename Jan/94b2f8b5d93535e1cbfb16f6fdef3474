MZANSI&rsquo;S top athletics coach, Jean Verster, is calling for more regular training camps for local athletes!The South African Sports Coach of the Year 2016 finalist, who is based in Potchefstroom, in North West, saw a group of European athletes staging a training camp in North West recently.That got him thinking about where Mzansi athletes could be, if they were also treated to regular training camps with big-name athletes in the world.Verster, who is the coach of Olympic gold medallist Caster Semenya, Olympic silver medallist Nigel Amos, SA 5 000m record-holder Elroy Gelant and Commonwealth bronze medallist Andre Olivier, is urging the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee and Athletics SA, to follow in the footsteps of top European countries.Gelant went to Kenya for a training camp and his coach said he will come back home a better athlete.Verster said: &ldquo;We must adopt a culture of having training camps. &ldquo;Look at Elroy for example, he&rsquo;s in Kenya learning from their top athletes and that will help him with his running. &ldquo;These camps will improve our athletes&rsquo; general training. It&rsquo;s not easy but we need camps. &ldquo;The system of training camps will help the middle distance runners, sprinters and road runners to improve their game.&rdquo;Verster said camps should last for more than three days. Verster, who also predicted another great year for local athletes, said local athletes are narrowing the gap between themselves and the top athlete in the world.Verster added:&ldquo;Look at Wayde van Niekerk and Caster. They are head-and-shoulder above their competitors in their respective fields.&ldquo;The top European athletes invest more time into their training and they work a lot behind the scenes. &ldquo;We should involve national coaches, physios and regular athletes&rsquo; coaches to make this to work for the athletes.&rdquo;Verster also added he expects Semenya to reclaim in London later this year, the 800m world title that she won in Berlin, Germany in 2009.Semenya is the favourite going into the London showpiece and her coach is confident she will continue from where she left off last year.Said Verster: &ldquo;Caster is working hard on the track and we expect another good year.&rdquo;
