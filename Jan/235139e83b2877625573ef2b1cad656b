BAFANA Bafana star Keagan Dolly is living his dream!And it seems there are quite a few things most people don&rsquo;t know about the Montpellier midfielder.SunSport spoke to Dolly&rsquo;s proud father, Ramon, for some insights into his 24-year-old son:Dolly grew up supporting Arsenal, an English Premiership side that he wants to play for in future.He has a sister named Ravenique (18) who is Keagan&rsquo;s biggest supporter.His soccer talent was spotted by his father when he was four years old. He continues to be calm, humble and focused, and still calls his family every day as he finds his feet in France.Steven Pienaar was his role model growing up. They come from the same kasi of Westbury, both played for Westbury Arsenal, the School of Excellence and Bafana Bafana. Now they are both plying their trade in Europe. Keagan left home at aged 12 to join the School of Excellence.The player, who joined French outfit Montpellier last Monday, has settled in and is training with the club&rsquo;s first team squad, where he will wear jersey No 20.Ramon told SunSport Dolly was determined to succeed in Europe.But he admits it took a lot of sacrifice and dedication from both Keagan and his family for the former SA Under-23 skipper to finally get his big break in Europe when he signed the four-and-a-half deal with Montpellier.Said Ramon: &ldquo;I told him that if he was serious about being a professional soccer player he had to start doing the ground work at 16 years and had to remain dedicated to his career.&rdquo;Ramon says there are lot more Dollys and Pienaars in Westbury: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that so much talent is wasted in our townships. Some parents don&rsquo;t help their kids develop and help them take the right path in life. &ldquo;We as a family were prepared to make whatever sacrifices to make sure Keagan succeeded.&rdquo;Ramon disclosed that he did not have a car when Keagan started playing football as a junior and had to catch taxis to watch his son play.Said Ramon: &ldquo;I even used to travel to Durban to support him. I did not mind catching taxis to go to games. I wanted to be there for him and now I am so proud of what he has achieved. &ldquo;But I knew he had the talent and drive to succeed.&rdquo;
