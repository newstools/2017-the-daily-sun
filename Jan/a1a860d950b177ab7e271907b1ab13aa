WHATEVER you do &ndash; don&rsquo;t scratch Cassper Nyovest&rsquo;s Bentley. The rapper loves that car so much, he might try to moer you!The Mama I Made It hitmaker got angry two weeks ago when an unknown motorist scratched his Bentley outside Cantare nightclub at Montecasino, in Fourways, north of Jozi.Witnesses say the motorist fled the scene in fear as Cassper charged toward him, and others tried to hold back the raging rapper.Bystanders alleged the artist, real name Refiloe Phoolo, parked his Bentley underground and went upstairs, only to be alerted that someone had marked his beloved wheels.An eyewitness told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Cassper stormed out of the club, rushing to the parking lot to check what damage had been done to his Bentley.&ldquo;He shouted at members of his entourage who were trying to prevent him attacking the motorist who had scratched his car.&rdquo;Another source said: &ldquo;What made Cassper so cross was that the motorist didn&rsquo;t want to acknowledge his fault. He just drove away, leaving the furious rapper on the scene.&rdquo;Sunday Sun contacted Cassper Nyovest, who confirmed the scratching incident.He admitted: &ldquo;Yeah, the guy scratched my car and fled the scene without talking to me.&ldquo;Now I just need to go and get the car fixed because he failed to take ownership of his wrongdoings.&rdquo;Cassper went on to say: &ldquo;Like any motorist, I was terrified about what could have happened to my car, but I got annoyed by his actions toward the incident.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to fight with him at all. All I wanted to know was how he had managed to get my car scratched like that.&ldquo;God will deal with him,&rdquo; he told Sunday Sun.
