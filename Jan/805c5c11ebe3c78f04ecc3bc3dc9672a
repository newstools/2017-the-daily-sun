RESIDENTS of Diventcheng in the Vaal took to the streets to protest against water shortages. The residents claim to have been experiencing water cuts for four months.They allege their taps run dry from 4am until about 11am. And that sometimes they can go up to three days without water. A resident told Daily Sun they decided to protest because they feel they are being disrespected. &ldquo;We reported the matter to the municipality in September but until now, nothing has been done. We decided to take to the streets because no one listens to us when we report matters peacefully.&rdquo; The residents have barricaded the streets with burning tyres, debris and rocks. They have vowed not to leave the streets until they have water running uninterruptedly from their taps. Most residents said their biggest worry were the toilets, which are always without water.&ldquo;We are living in small houses with toilets inside. When water runs out the toilets start stinking.&ldquo;We cannot even fill buckets with water because the taps just let out small drips,&rdquo; said one resident. Ward Councillor Stanley Senyanya said they thought the situation was temporary. He said: &ldquo;We were surprised to see people taking to the streets in protest. &ldquo;We know about the water crisis because they reported it and we tried to solve it by supplying them with water tanks temporarily. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why these houses have been without water, but we will get back to the residents as soon as we know.&rdquo; Captain Attie Loate said police would keep monitoring the area.&ldquo;No arrests have been made so far.&rdquo;
