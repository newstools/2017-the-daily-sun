THE wait for the matric results is almost over. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will announce the national results at Vodacom World in Midrand, Gauteng after 4pm today, while provincial departments will announce theirs tomorrow.Matric pupils will be able to see their results in various newspapers tomorrow. The education department said the process of writing and marking the exams went well despite some hiccups. In Limpopo, maths paper one was leaked to about 100 Giyani High pupils, leading to the arrest of a 52-year-old man. The department said investigations would continue and action would be taken against those involved. The results of pupils at the affected schools will not be released until the investigation is completed. Quality assurance board Umalusi&rsquo;s Mafu Rakometsi said they had successfully done quality checks and standardised the results from the Independent Examination Board, the SA Comprehensive Assessment Institute, the Benchmark Assessment Agency, and the departments of basic education and of higher education and training. In KZN, matrics at an eThekwini school had to write their exams under guard after rival pupils threatened to set their school and cars on fire. This was the third year matrics wrote under the Curriculum Assessment Policy Statements system. Experts expect 2016 results to be better than previous years.
