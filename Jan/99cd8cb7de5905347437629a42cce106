A THUG knew that the madala was blind and took advantage of that.He wanted to steal from him and had a perfect plan.He waited for a rainy night to go and steal the madala&rsquo;s pig. But what the thug didn&rsquo;t know was that John Mothopeng (73) of Phasha section in Klipgat, North West might have been blind, but he was a very light sleeper.As the man was busy in the madala&rsquo;s kraal in the early hours of Sunday morning, it stopped raining. Then the dogs started barking. That was when madala John realised that something was wrong.He immediately became worried about his livestock &ndash; sheep, pigs and chickens.&ldquo;When I heard the sound of the pig, I immediately woke Molefenyana Photlhedi (52) up, who is my helper and also a shepherd.&rdquo; Molefenyana said he took a torch and went out to see what was happening. &ldquo;When I got to the kraal I saw a man stabbing the pig with a knife,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;I flashed the torch in his face and he fled, leaving his knife behind.&rdquo; John said his pig died later that day and it was a great loss for him, because he had plans for the animal.&ldquo;I bought it last week so that it could breed more pigs, because the male pig I have is old and I needed a younger one.&rdquo; Members of the Baruwa Kgomo Association, a farmers&rsquo; group, visited madala John to see how they could help to find the thug.North West Police spokesman Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that a case of attempted theft was opened.&ldquo;No arrest has been made it this stage,&rdquo; he said.
