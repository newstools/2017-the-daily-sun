THESE kasi people need a boat to visit their neighbours! This is because a blocked drain has turned their street into a river of sewage. It&rsquo;s happening at extension 5 in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. Stinking water has been flowing for months but the municipality has not responded to residents&rsquo; complaints.It&rsquo;s not just the flood that angers them, but the terrible stink of human kak that comes from the river of sewage.Residents said it&rsquo;s very difficult to cross the street.Angry Jane Themba (59) said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s kak everywhere in the area. &ldquo;What makes things worse is the unfinished streets that have been under construction since April. That is a very long time!&ldquo;The water gathers in dams in the unfinished streets. It&rsquo;s very risky for drunkards because they might fall in and drown at night.&rdquo; She added that children are also at risk, especially if they play on the streets during the holidays. &ldquo;What if they push one of them into the dirty kak water and the kid drowns?&rdquo; Jane asked.She said the main kak dam is on a busy street where most of the local spaza shops are situated.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t even sleep because the filthy water is attracting a lot of mosquitoes that bite us,&rdquo; Jane said. Lebo Mabena (33) said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t host parties because of the smell. &ldquo;We have to book and pay for other venues because we can&rsquo;t bring people to this stinky area.&ldquo;Our windows and doors are always closed, because once we open them, the houses fill with flies.&rdquo;Councillor Enos Chiloane said: &ldquo;I have reported the matter to the relevant departments and I am trying my best to help the community.&rdquo;He added that the municipality is aware of the problem in extension 5 and has promised to fix it.
