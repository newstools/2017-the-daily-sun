MARITZBURG United have drawn up a shortlist of three candidates to replace head coach Ernst Middendorp. This was confirmed by United chairman Farook Kadodia yesterday, who said he would reveal the identity of his new head coach at the weekend. &ldquo;I have shortlisted three candidates, two foreigners and one local. We&rsquo;ve taken our time,&rdquo; said Kadodia. The United chairman would not reveal the names of the three candidates but SunSport understands that former Orlando Pirates, Bidvest Wits and Ajax Cape Town coach Roger de Sa is the local candidate and Brazilian born Julio Leal, another former Bucs, Moroka Swallows and Polokwane coach, is possibly one of the foreign candidates. The Team of Choice played the last five matches of 2016 with Fadlu Davids and his bother Maahier in charge as interim coaches after Middendorp&rsquo;s departure. The Davids brothers &ndash; unbeaten in their five matches in charge &ndash; will be handing over the reins to the new coach with the club in a healthy eighth position. Kadodia said he would wait until they get their man before they venture into the market to beef up their squad. The transfer window opened on Sunday. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be going crazy in this transfer window. We will wait for the new coach to decide which players he wants,&rdquo; added Kadodia. The Team of Choice signed 10 players at the start of the season and these players have already made a huge impact in the first 15 matches of the 2016-17 campaign. Players signed included two former Bafana Bafana defenders, Bryce Moon and Bevan Fransman, in addition to Andrea Fileccia, Bongani Mpandle, Dennis Wieldiech, Devon Saal, Themba Shabalala, Blessing Moyo, Lebohang Maboe and Luyanda Ntshangase.
