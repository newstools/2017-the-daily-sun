A FREAK accident has left a family house falling apart. Now the owners don&rsquo;t know who is going to fix it.In December 2015 a truck hit 42-year-old Manthabiseng Kayingana&rsquo;s house.She was drinking coffee at about 7am in the dining room. She then decided to check something at the bedroom. A few minutes later she heard a loud bang. Manthabiseng rushed to check what was happening. She was shocked to see a mini truck in the house. In the truck there were two men &ndash; the driver and the passenger. Manthabiseng said the guys were from different shops around the township. &ldquo;They were delivering milk to those shops. The driver lost control of the truck after a brick was thrown at the vehicle during an attempted robbery. Then the truck landed in my house,&rdquo; said Manthabiseng. Xolani Kayingana (45) said he received a call telling him about the incident. &ldquo;I left work at about 10am to check the situation at home. I was shocked to see the truck in my house. The owner of the company, Robert, promised to do something about the matter, but he never came back again. I phoned him in October last year. He told me that he cannot help me because he spent a lot of money fixing the truck and he took the driver to the hospital. &ldquo;He said I should ask residents to donate bricks for me because they saw what happened. I am very worried because I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s going to fix my house.&rdquo;Robert, who refused to give his surname, said it was not the fault of the driver. &ldquo;The driver was unconscious after a brick was thrown at him. I never said I was going to fix the house. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to comment further on this matter,&rdquo; said Robert.
