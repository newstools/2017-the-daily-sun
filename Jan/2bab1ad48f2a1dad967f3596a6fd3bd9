EVEN in death, Ananias Mathe remained under heavy guard.The lifeless body of the Mozambican prisoner was guarded by scores of warders as if he was faking his death in one final escape plan. His family had come to collect his body from the Gale Street government mortuary in Durban, KZN yesterday.The SunTeam could not speak to his wife and relatives were seated in a Correctional Services vehicle surrounded by warders. The wife was later taken to the back of the mortuary building in the car. Daily Sun&rsquo;s presence caused a delay as warders refused to take his body out of the mortuary building fearing cameras. A member of the public who had come to fetch the body of a relative said he was told the body was ready in the morning but he couldn&rsquo;t get it until Ananias was removed.The serial rapist mysteriously died last week in King Edward Hospital, Durban after he complained of stomach pain. His death was not regarded as normal and there is a forensic investigation by the State. A government official at the mortuary said the reason his body was there was because a post mortem had to be conducted.Ananias made headlines in 2006 when he became the first ever prisoner to escape from C Max prison in Tshwane. He was then transferred to the Kokstad C Max prison in KZN and again tried to escape.Attempts to get comment from Correctional Services provincial commissioner Mnikeli Nxele or national spokesman, Manelisi Wolela failed as their phones were off. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest is being investigated by Umbilo police.
