THE SA Football Association will begin the search for a new national head coach this week.The new Bafana Bafana mentor will replace Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba, who was fired last month.Safa is not worried about the pending legal case regarding Mashaba&rsquo;s dismissal.Mashaba was axed after a lengthy disciplinary hearing in which he was found guilty of gross misconduct, insubordination and bringing Safa into disrepute.His contract was due to expire after the 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia.Earlier this month Mashaba&rsquo;s legal team, led by Claudio Bollo, warned Safa not appoint a new coach while they take his dismissal to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. The hearing is likely to be heard on 7 February.However, Safa CEO Dennis Mumble insists they did everything by the book when they fired Mashaba: &ldquo;We are not worried about the case.&rdquo;Although he stressed no coach had been approached those believed to be in the running are SuperSport United&rsquo;s Stuart Baxter, Gavin Hunt of Bidvest Wits, and former Bafana, Portugal and Iran coach Carlos Queiroz.Mumble revealed that he had received hundreds of CVs from out-of-work coaches looking for a job.He said: &ldquo;My office is piled high with CVs from coaches from all over the world wanting to coach Bafana. But I&rsquo;m not going to look at them. We need somebody who knows African football and can take us to the World Cup in Russia next year. We will start the process this week.&rdquo;Bafana&rsquo;s first assignment in 2017 is a friendly yet to be arranged at the end of March: &ldquo;We have coaches in place (Mashaba&rsquo;s assistants, Owen Da Gama and Thabo Senong). I&rsquo;m busy negotiating with an African country to play us on that Fifa date in March ahead of the opening 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in June.&rdquo;Bafana are in a tough qualifying group with Nigeria, Libya and Seychelles.
