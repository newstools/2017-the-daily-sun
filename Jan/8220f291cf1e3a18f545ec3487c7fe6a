If residents are not happy with the toilets, they should raise the matter with the municipality.”Themba Gadebe, spokesman for Ekurhuleni Municipality, said: “The transition from the old contract to a new contract resulted in the change of service providers. The new service provider has supplied improved chemical toilets. “Some squatters want chemical toilets from the Red Ants with old specification and they are rejecting new toilets with improved specification. A meeting has been arranged with the community leaders to address their concerns.”
