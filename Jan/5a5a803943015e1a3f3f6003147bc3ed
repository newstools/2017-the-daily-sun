DANIEL&rsquo;S deep voice helps him deliver special performances.&ldquo;My voice is not planned, it is natural,&rdquo; said Daniel Hadebe, who plays the role of powerful gangster Titus in Gold Diggers.&ldquo;People love Titus&rsquo; voice and they recognise it easily.&rdquo;Titus battles with issues of power, money, respect and survival. He believes his family is weak and he is strong.Daniel said he tries to portray the role realistically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody in real life who can tell me how Titus should be played. I just follow my instincts to bring the character to life. Emotions are very important.&rdquo;Daniel said he respects Titus. Through the role he has found how strange it is to dethrone your family even though you need them. &ldquo;We all need our family, whatever the circumstances.&rdquo;He said he works well with his co-star, Tina Jaxa.&ldquo;We both improvise what our characters say without relying too much on the script.&rdquo;Daniel started his career as a model but he always wanted to be an actor.He said in Soshanguve, Tshwane, where he grew up, there weren&rsquo;t many opportunities.&ldquo;Fortunately, I had the right body to be a model.&rdquo;He built up contacts through modelling gigs and auditioned for the lead role in Shogun Khumalo in 2006. &ldquo;That is when people started to notice me.&ldquo;I joined Scandal as Jay-Jay in the same year,&rdquo; said Daniel.His run on Gold Diggers has been his longest stay in any series and he regards it as the highlight of his career.When Daniel is not shooting he runs Him International, where he finds and grooms new talent for modelling, acting and music.He also works on the reality TV show Jezebels and will star in the movie State Enemy, where he will play cash-in-transit robber Collen Chauke. &ldquo;Both projects will be ready by the middle of the year,&rdquo; said Daniel.
