ESKOM on Friday warned that there would be power cuts in municipalities that had not settled their debt with them. In the Free State, residents of Nketoana, Nala, Tokologo, Dihlabeng, Masilonyana and Mantsopa municipalities might have their power switched off. Affected municipalities in North West are Ventersdorp, Mamusa, Naledi, Lekwa-Teemane, Maquassi Hills, Madibeng and Kgetlengrivier. Mpumalanga municipalities that owe Eskom money are eMalahleni, Mkhondo, Mbombela, Lekwa, Msukaligwa and Chief Albert Luthuli. In Northern Cape, Ubuntu and Renosterberg municipalities are affected while Walter Sisulu Municipality in Eastern Cape also owes Eskom money. Eskom acting CEO Matshela Koko said: &ldquo;The law compels us to collect overdue debt. Failure to do so has terrible consequences for the power utility.&rdquo;
