Kaizer Chiefs appear set to retain the services of striker Camaldine Abraw despite reports linking the Togo international with a move away from Naturena.The 26-year-old forward has been injured for the entire season up to now although his recovery is ahead of schedule and could be ready to make a return in the not too distant future.It had been reported that Amakhosi were ready to release Abraw to free up a space for a foreign player on the club's roster. However, a source told&nbsp;Goal&nbsp;that this was not the case and he could feature for the side in the remainder of the 2016/17 season.The source said: "Abraw recovered sooner than everyone expected, and for this reason the medical team believes he can be ready before March. Their mandate is to get him ready as soon as possible. He's improving everyday and could soon return to action."If he recovers, he will surely be registered. So, there is no truth that he might be offloaded. Komphela still believes in the player, and he wants to have him back soon. This is why he is in Potchefstroom with the team, and he has been working very hard knowing that the club still needs him."
