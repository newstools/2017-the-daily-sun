TEACHERS in Limpopo took to the streets yesterday to voice their frustration at the lack of study materials at schools. This is despite the provincial education department&rsquo;s undertaking that it would deliver all the books by the end of the month. The teachers from the South African Democratic Teachers Union said they are frustrated because they don&rsquo;t know what to do while they wait for stationery and textbooks. Matome Raphasha, the union&rsquo;s provincial secretary, said about 70% of the schools in the province have not received textbooks. Raphasha said the shortage of books at schools demoralises teachers and pupils. &ldquo;They go to school but have nothing to do because of the failure of the department. &ldquo;This will affect our matric results at the end of the year because we are losing time.&rdquo;Another of the union&rsquo;s concerns is that some of the teachers, especially those from neighbouring countries, have not been paid their salaries since April 2015. &ldquo;These teachers are the ones who put Limpopo on the map but the same department which holds many awards is not paying them. &ldquo;These teachers don&rsquo;t know if they should go to class or stay at home. We want the department to stop what they are doing and put education first.&rdquo;Ishmael Kgetjepe, MEC for education in Limpopo, is adamant that they will meet the end of January deadline, despite allegations by some of the teachers that there are no books in the warehouses. Kgetjepe said they are aware of the challenges raised by the teachers. &ldquo;We are currently resolving those challenges, including the shortage of stationery,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We will also respond to their memorandum within 14 days.&rdquo;In 2014, most Limpopo schools had no textbooks for the entire year.Five departments, including the education department, were placed under administration in 2011, when Limpopo was declared bankrupt.
