ACTRESS Liteboho Molise, who is famous for her role as Teboho in the SABC2 soapie, Muvhango, will be ending the year with a bang!She&rsquo;s the face of the new Black Like Me Naturals hair brand that is aimed at promoting natural hair.Although Teboho previously S-curled or blow-dried her hair, she now wants to reclaim her crown by going the natural hair look route.She told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Keeping my hair natural is a conscious decision. To proudly and boldly wear my curls is to celebrate myself as an African woman.&ldquo;With my acting job, it&rsquo;s never entirely up to me how I want to wear my hair because producers and directors develop the characters I portray, and usually they wear processed hair.&rdquo;The actress added she&rsquo;s happy her current producers and directors are supportive of her natural hair look.&ldquo;For me, natural hair is more than a fashion statement, it&rsquo;s an affirmation of my true cultural identity.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried so many styles over the years, and ultimately it&rsquo;s my natural hair that makes me feel the most beautiful and the most confident!&rdquo; she said.She referred to the recent Pretoria High School for Girls natural hair protest as a reminder that we should be proud of who we are and how we look.She told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;It broke my heart into pieces to see such young kids standing up for wearing their natural hair.&ldquo;This shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue, but it is and it&rsquo;s sad.&rdquo;
