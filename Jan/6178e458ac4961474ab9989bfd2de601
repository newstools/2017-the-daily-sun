THE girl&rsquo;s short life ended in tragedy at 18 years.Mbalenhle Ndima died a painful death in a car crash. Her heartbroken sister Lindiwe tried to give her a dignified funeral. But the girl&rsquo;s remains suffered indignity &ndash; in a rotten coffin!Lindiwe Ndima (35), from Meadowlands in Soweto, said the undertaker treated her family badly &ndash; which made the heartache worse. She claimed that when the family was about to take the coffin from the mortuary, the handles broke off! &ldquo;We were shocked when a man came with a hammer to fix the coffin while my sister&rsquo;s body was in it,&rdquo; said Lindiwe.The broken body was exposed, and Lindiwe said the undertaker had not bathed her sister&rsquo;s remains. This was a moment of horror for the family. Lindiwe claimed: &ldquo;They are not professional and need to be sued! The undertaker&rsquo;s vehicle had no petrol. &ldquo;We had to wait almost an hour for them to organise petrol money and take the body home where mourners and churchgoers were waiting to say their last goodbyes.&rdquo; Kago Funeral Home owner Joe Kago said it was only one handle that broke and they managed to fix it back on. &ldquo;It was not true that we gave the family a rotten coffin. All I know is that the family is happy and we did a good job on the funeral of their family member.&rdquo; He said he hadn&rsquo;t heard any complaints from family members.Johan Rossouw, who is the chairman of the SA Funeral Industry Regulatory Authority, urged the family to lay official charges with the organisation, which help to investigate and bring justice for them.He said undertakers who provide poor services should be reported.
