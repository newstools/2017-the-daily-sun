THE elderly people at the Christian Care Society for the Aged and Chronic Sick in Kwa-Mashu, north of Durban, were forced to do everything for themselves.This was after protesting workers took to the streets yesterday morning.The angry workers are demanding an increase and new uniforms as well as other working equipment.A worker claimed: &ldquo;Working at the centre has become a headache over the years. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t received an increase since 2013. We work very hard every day but they don&rsquo;t pay us our salaries on time.&rdquo; Another claimed they don&rsquo;t even get bonuses at the end of the year. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to pay our children&rsquo;s school fees. The money we get is very little. What&rsquo;s even worse is that we don&rsquo;t even get payslips.&rdquo; The worker claimed there was a shortage of equipment too. &ldquo;There are not enough gloves to use when we help the gogos and mkhulus. We sometimes use our bare hands to assist the elderly. And sometimes we run out of nappies for the sick and elderly.&rdquo;The human resources manager, Sphiwe Nkabinde, said he was not aware of the protest but he later heard about it and got into a meeting with workers.&ldquo;Among the things they were not happy about was the money that was deducted from their accounts. We deducted money from their salaries in December last year because they had embarked on a strike and we have the no work no pay policy,&rdquo; he said.He said they were trying to resolve the workers&rsquo; issues.
