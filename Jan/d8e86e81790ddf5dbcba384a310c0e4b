He was arrested instead.Joseph Mabuza, a spokesman for the department of community safety, security and liaison, said the motorist was arrested on Friday after offering officers a bribe. The man appeared in the Nelspruit Regional Court on Monday for bribery and reckless and negligent driving. He was released on R1 500 bail and the case was postponed.Community safety MEC Pat Ngomane applauded the officers for arresting the man, saying it would serve as a lesson to those who try to bribe law enforcers.“We cannot win the battle against road accidents if motorists bribe officers when they are caught on the wrong side of the law.”
