WHEN the mastandi told Eunice Khoza (35) to get out, she refused. She claimed she hadn&rsquo;t been given proper notice and said the woman, Lydia Tsela (67), was not the real mastandi.But early on Sunday morning the mastandi was back at the yard in Alexandra, Joburg. This time she was armed with an axe and she chopped down the door.Eunice watched as the woman went to the windows and allegedly started destroying them as well.&ldquo;You are going to get out of my yard. This is my place and I will die for it,&rdquo; screamed Lydia swinging the axe around. Eunice claimed: &ldquo;She was married to the landlord and they got divorced. &ldquo;We pay the rent to the landlord&rsquo;s son because we know him as the new landlord. Lydia told Daily Sun she is the mastandi.&ldquo;I was married to my husband Jabu and everything he had is mine. &ldquo;Whether we were divorced or not is none of their business. &ldquo;They must not interfere in my affairs,&rdquo; said angry Lydia.
