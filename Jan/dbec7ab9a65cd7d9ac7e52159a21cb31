FADED kwaito star Msawawa&rsquo;s music career may soon undergo a revival! That&rsquo;s because the Bowungakanani hitmaker aims to reunite with his former dancer and Skomplazi member, Vukani Khoza. Rumour has it the duo kissed and made up about three months ago, when Msawawa, real name Sboniso Dlamini, flew to Jozi from his native Durban to coax Vukani to work with him on his upcoming album. A source claimed Msawawa had thought &ldquo;bringing back the good old days&rdquo; would help his career soar again. &ldquo;Msawawa wants to go back to basics, as he and Vukani worked well together at Bonsai Entertainment. They&rsquo;re at Vukani&rsquo;s studio and dance school in Yeoville, Jozi,&rdquo; said the mole. A second source claimed: &ldquo;Most producers in Durban don&rsquo;t want to work with Msawawa any more. But teaming up with Vukani might bring back the glory days.&rdquo; A third source claimed the duo would only collaborate on one song, saying: &ldquo;After they&rsquo;re done, Msawawa will head back to Durban to focus on his business, Msawawa&rsquo;s Corner.&rdquo; Vukani confirmed he was back with Msawawa and that the song will be released under his company, African Child Production.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve planned this a long time ago. Due to our busy schedule, we kept postponing it.&ldquo;The song title is Bukuthi Unjani and we&rsquo;re expecting to release it before Easter. Actually, I was his mentor, but we were young and people decided to make decisions for us,&rdquo; he said.Msawawa said: &ldquo;As my mentor, Vukani introduced me to the music industry. &ldquo;Working with him is awesome. We under-stand each other. That&rsquo;s why I decided to go back to my roots.&rdquo;
