HIGHER Education Minister Blade Nzimande has claimed the #FeesMustFall protest was hijacked by people who hoped to cause public higher education to collapse. He said although he believed the movement was begun with good intentions, it turned into a platform for opportunists. Speaking at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday, Nzimande said the campaign was used to discredit the government. He said his department and the government would do everything in their power to prevent the protests from flaring up again this year. Nzimande said if the protests continued, poor and working class students would suffer most. &ldquo;Students from middle and upper class families will be able to apply for private education or study abroad.&rdquo; The minister said there were processes in place to identify long-term solutions for providing higher education funding. He said the government had engaged the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) to assist students from poor families. &ldquo;NSFAS will be funding 205 000 students at universities and 200 000 at colleges this year.&rdquo; Nzimande said the government would pay the fee increase capped at 8% for all qualifying registered students with a family income of less than R600 000 per year. &ldquo;This is a grant, which covers the increase for tuition and accommodation and will not have to be repaid by qualifying students. &ldquo;This will benefit more than 75% of university and college students and at some institutions, more than 90% of students,&rdquo; he said. Deputy minister Mduduzi Manana had created programmes to help pupils who passed matric but had not applied to universities. &ldquo;Sector education and training programmes will provide 100 821 learning opportunities in the form of learnerships, bursaries, internships and skills programmes.&rdquo;
