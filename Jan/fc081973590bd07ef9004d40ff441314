TSOTSIS have a new trick to steal your money! That&rsquo;s according to cops at various Jozi police stations in Gauteng. Captain Xoli Mbele, spokesman for the Joburg Central Police Station, said: &ldquo;We would like to warn the community not to become victims of &lsquo;money bombs&rsquo;. &ldquo;Suspects target people after they have withdrawn money from a teller or ATM. &ldquo;Most suspects are women who work with a group of men. &ldquo;One of them will walk in front of a victim and throw a bundle of money on the ground. &ldquo;Then one of their friends will pick it up in front of the victim. &ldquo;Inside the bundle are papers. On top they put one real R100 or R200 note. The suspect tells the victim to share the cash because both of them have seen it.&ldquo;They will later take the victim to a hiding place where the friends will join them. &ldquo;The victim will then be assaulted and robbed of his or her money,&rdquo; said Mbele. Cops have these safety tips for people:Change direction if you see money lying on the ground in front of you. Remember &ndash; everyone can be a target.Don&rsquo;t obey a person who suggests sharing found money.Call the cops or security guards if you are targeted.If you are being followed, make a loud noise to draw attention to yourself.Make sure that you notify the police on patrol if you feel you are being targeted by thugs.
