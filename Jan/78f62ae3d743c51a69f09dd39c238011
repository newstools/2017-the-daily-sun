THE house of God needs an ombudsman!This is the call from a newly founded church in the Eastern Cape.The Reformed Ethiopian Catholic Church of Southern Africa said an ombudsman is needed to bring an end to pastors feeding church members snakes and grass and spraying them with Doom. &ldquo;We need to regulate how churches operate in South Africa,&rdquo; said Mlungisi Matiwane, a registrar at the church launched on Sunday in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth.&ldquo;Churches should be regulated and there have to be consequences for breaking the rules. &ldquo;We cannot tolerate situations where people are fed snakes and grass and sprayed with Doom, and no one gets punished.&rdquo;Church President Reverend Banele Mente wants to see churches guided by their constitutions.&ldquo;Splinter groups form as a reaction against autocratic leadership. &ldquo;If church leaders bend their constitution to favour certain groups, the church is torn apart. &ldquo;We cannot allow society to be exposed to pastors doing wrong things. We need to chase the evil spirits from our churches,&rdquo; said Mente.Matiwane told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We left the Church of Umzi Wase Tiyopiya. We had no fight with them, but decided to go back to the principles set down in 1900 when the Ethiopian churches were established.&ldquo;Also, as a concerned group, we discovered that we had no room to enforce the church&rsquo;s constitution in our previous congregation.&rdquo;
