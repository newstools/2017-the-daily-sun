AMAJITA hope their preparation for the upcoming Caf Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations (Afcon) will take them to the Fifa Under-20 World Cup.Thabo Senong&rsquo;s charges will go into camp for their initial preparations on Thursday.From there, they will play friendly games against Under-20 Afcon hosts, Zambia, on 8 and 26 February.Their third continental friendly will be against and Mali on 12 March .Although Amajita were looking to secure another friendly against Egypt, it seemed Senong was happy with the three matches ahead.He said their ultimate goal was to qualify for the World Cup in Korea in May.In the last edition of the Afcon, Amajita choked and were eliminated from the first round, ultimately failing to fight for a place in the World Cup.Although Senong said they would take each Afcon game as it comes, their side&rsquo;s priority was to win all its upcoming matches.In the Afcon tournament, South Africa will have to win their group or finish second to continue to the semifinals.This will give Amajita a realistic chance to challenge for a place to the World Cup.Competing in Group B of the Afcon tournament, Senong&rsquo;s boys will face Senegal, Sudan and Cameroon.Their friendly game rivals Zambia, nicknamed Junior Chipolopolo, will tackle Guinea, Congo and Kenya in Group E.&ldquo;Our main aim is to go to the next round,&rdquo; Senong said.&ldquo;We will take it one game at a time, but our priority is to win all our games, regardless of the tough opponents we face.&rdquo;The 31-man squad will probably give the technical team headache when it has to select the final team to Zambia. Players Katleho Mohamme, Kobamelo Kodisang, Phakamani Mahlambi, Liam Jordan, Khanyisa Mayo and Tercius Malepe have proven reliable for Amajita.An optimistic Senong is hoping to get the players he had selected for the camp and not have to deal with the &ldquo;country versus club&rdquo; drama.He told SunSport: &ldquo;We will see who will report to camp. That challenge will be discussed, if and when it arises. For now, let&rsquo;s see what happens.&rdquo;
