GOGO Rossa Mabilo can&rsquo;t move around her home! It is all because of a disfunctional drain that is spilling sewage everywhere in her yard in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni.It has cost the 75-year-old gogo her business. She had been selling skop from her yard. But customers do not come to buy from her anymore because of the way her yard smells. She has run out of ideas on how to fix the problem and get on with her business.&ldquo;This drain system has been terrorising me since last year in March. I have reported this to the municipality but I never got help and now I can&rsquo;t even walk freely in my yard.&rdquo; Gogo Rossa said the leak is located behind her toilet. &ldquo;My neighbours as well are complaining about the terrible smell. But there is nothing I can do as I am waiting for assistance from the municipality.&ldquo;I hired two plumbers who told me that they could not help me because they would charge me money I did not have. I desperately need help before everybody turns against me. Also, I fear that I will get sick from all of this dirt.&rdquo;City of Ekurhuleni spokesman Themba Gadebe said: &ldquo;Most of the sewage blockages are caused by foreign objects that are not supposed to be there.&ldquo; People throw objects that are not supposed to be in such places and that results in blockages.&ldquo;The community of Ekurhuleni can reach us on 086 054 3000 to report such cases.&rdquo;
