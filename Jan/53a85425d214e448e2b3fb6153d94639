A FIGHT between a makoti and the brother-in-law she raised as a child has turned ugly.The two are in a bitter war over the assets of Nthabiseng Motai&rsquo;s late husband. Nthabiseng (43) alleges that Daniel Motai (29) of Klipspruit, Soweto arrived up on Saturday night with his friends and beat her and her daughter.&ldquo;I feel betrayed by someone I raised as my own. I have never been moered like this in my life.&rdquo; Nthabiseng said Daniel lived with her and her late husband from an early age. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t believe he would beat me up like that. He even tramped on my head. My husband loved his little brother dearly and spoiled him very much. Now that he&rsquo;s gone and there&rsquo;s no one to spoon-feed him, he feels entitled.&rdquo;A case of assault was opened and a protection order issued against Daniel, but Nthabiseng said he continued to terrorise her.Daniel told Daily Sun: &ldquo;This woman is living with another man in my house. I am the rightful beneficiary of that house and I have the papers to prove it. We even went to the department of housing and they checked on the system and it clearly shows that my brother made me the beneficiary. So I just want what&rsquo;s mine. Running to the police won&rsquo;t help her.&rdquo;SAPS police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said a case of assault is being investigated and no arrests have been made.
