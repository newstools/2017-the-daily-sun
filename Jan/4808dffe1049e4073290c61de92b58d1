JANUARY is the hardest month of the year and most people struggle to make ends meet after spending large amounts of money over Christmas. For residents of Delmore in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, the situation is being made worse by thugs who steal the little food they have! More than 10 shacks have been hit by what residents call January thugs. The thieves steal mealie-meal, rice, meat and even paraffin. Sizwe Hlatswayo, a community leader, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t care about the valuables you have. They only want food.&rdquo; Hlatswayo said they broke into a tuckshop to steal groceries. &ldquo;We think they have enough to last them until June. They&rsquo;re not hungry anymore.&rdquo; Another victim, Regina Mbhele, said they recently broke into her shack to steal rice, tinned food and a 2-litre bottle of paraffin. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t at home when they broke in. I think they targeted my shack after seeing me leave.&ldquo;The containers I keep food in were scattered on the floor and my kitchen unit was empty. However, they didn&rsquo;t take my TV, music system or generator. Nothing had been taken from my lounge. I was shocked and amazed at the same time. I asked myself what kind of thugs these were.&rdquo;Regina said the strangest thing was that the thugs had closed her door after they left to make sure no one took her valuables. &ldquo;The thugs were obviously really hungry. I didn&rsquo;t open a case because I felt sorry for them.&rdquo; Sifiso Nyembe said the thugs had stolen braai packs from his shack.
