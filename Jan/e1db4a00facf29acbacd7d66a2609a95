THEY passed matric, but could not move on to tertiary education because they had no money for tuition.But 29 students from poor families will this year be able to further their studies with the help of Polokwane Municipality. Some of them are from child-headed families with no one working. Simon Mahladisa (25) passed matric in 2010, but had to look for odd jobs to support his younger brother after their parents died. He said life was not easy for him and his brother. &ldquo;I am going to study at the University of the Western Cape and I will never disappoint. I have been waiting for this opportunity for quite a long time.&rdquo;The municipality set aside R1,5 million from its bursary fund to sponsor the students. The money was raised through the executive bursary fund by the Mayoral Golf Cup Challenge and the Rugby Challenge. Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng said the bursary scheme has been able to help 129 students over the years. Staying in the scheme is tough &ndash; students who perform below an 80% pass rate risk losing council funding. That happened to 19 students last year.&ldquo;As the municipality, we acknowledge that education has the power to transform lives and build the foundation for a brighter future. But poverty can make it difficult to access quality education. &ldquo;We only wish that more funds were available so that we could take in a larger number,&rdquo; she said.
