THUGS have again vandalised a primary school&rsquo;s kitchen, stealing its gas stove and cylinder.Sunday morning&rsquo;s break-in was the second time that the school&rsquo;s cooking equipment had been targeted.Luckily this time the thugs apparently were too lazy to carry the heavy stove and cylinder and hid the items under a big tree not far from the school.Teachers and pupils of Sipho Hashe Combined School in KwaZakhele, Port Elizabeth on Monday morning discovered that the school kitchen had been broken into again.Principal Sisa Dlula told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Last year thugs also stole our stove and big gas cylinder. &ldquo;This time they again broke the lock and stole our new gas stove and gas cylinder.&rdquo;He said he is concerned for the kids&rsquo; health following the repeated break-ins.&ldquo;The school&rsquo;s kitchen is a source of nutrition for 400 pupils. Before the missing cooking equipment was recovered I rushed home to get my stove so that we could serve a meal to the hungry kids. &ldquo;I appeal to the community to help us get rid of this evil.&rdquo; Cops said the school&rsquo;s caretaker should open a case at the nearest police station.
