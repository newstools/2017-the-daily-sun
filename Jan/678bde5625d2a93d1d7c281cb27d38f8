A year later, the pass rate sank to 66%. Last year the school only managed to obtain a 54,4% pass rate.“Our biggest problem last year was a lack of funding by the department of education. “The lack of funds ruined many of our ambitious plans.“We are greatly disappointed by last year’s performance. “Staff members feel as if the school has hit rock bottom. “We want to turn the situation around.” Member of the provincial legislature Vuyani Limba said the education department should monitor the school’s performance.“I attribute the decline in performance to the principal and deputy’s leave. Something must be wrong when staff members go on leave for two years. We will look into this matter.”
