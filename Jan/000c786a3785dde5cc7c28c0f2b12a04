DAVID Makhura has welcomed the decision to withdraw the extended shopping hours granted to liquor traders.The Gauteng premier asked the MEC for economic development, Lebogang Maile, and MEC for community safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane that the Gauteng Liquor Board withdraw its decision.&ldquo;We call upon law enforcement agencies to do their work and for communities to work with us in promoting responsible drinking,&rdquo; said Makhura. &ldquo;The issue of alcohol abuse is a matter of great concern to us. It contributes to social crimes.&rdquo;The Liquor Board announced yesterday that it will no longer extend trading hours.The ANC Women&rsquo;s League had said that extending liquor trading hours is an insult to the ANC.&ldquo;Portraying members and supporters of the ANC as people who will require extra hours of purchasing liquor is a blatant attempt to insult the principles and values that the ANC stands for. &ldquo;The league will not allow this historic event to be viewed as a drinking spree which needs relaxed liquor trading hours,&rdquo; the league said in a statement. Initially the Liquor Board announced on Tuesday special dispensation liquor licences or a weekend pass for the ANC&rsquo;s annual birthday celebration.The board said the relaxation of the trading hours was in line with section 3 and section 33 of the Gauteng Liquor Act which grants it the discretion to amend liquor licensing conditions such as trading times.
