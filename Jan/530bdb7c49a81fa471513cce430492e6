A PEACE committee member of the notorious Glebelands Hostel in Umlazi said he won&rsquo;t run and hide.This was after he miraculously survived a barrage of bullets fired at his car.Usually when people see death coming, they run for their lives and go into hiding, but the 38-year-old said he was prepared to die to bring peace to the hostel.He told Daily Sun he knew someone wanted to reduce his days on earth, but that would not be in vain if his blood helped restore peace.&ldquo;I cannot run if my blood is meant to be shed. I have told my family that they should stay prepared. I thank God for every hour that I&rsquo;m alive.&rdquo; The recent attempt to finish him off happened on Sunday near Reunion on his way from Isipingo.A group of gunmen allegedly came out of nowhere and fired a hail of bullets towards his car.&ldquo;Fortunately I escaped with no injuries. I have informed the cops but did not open a case because I don&rsquo;t think that can save me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware that I am being attacked by the people who are against the establishment of the peace committee in the hostel.&rdquo; He told the People&rsquo;s Paper that two weeks ago, the gunmen went to his home on the south coast of KZN, hoping to find him there, but luckily he was not home at the time.In the midst of his problems, the man is accused of murder and is also attending a case at Umlazi Magistrates Court regarding the murder of another hostel dweller, Bongani Mthembu, who was shot dead two years ago.The killing was associated with a fight over room allocations and political interference in the hostel that began in March 2014. A total of 65 people lost their lives.Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed that no case was opened. &ldquo;If the victim wants the matter to be investigated, he should go to the police station and open a case.&rdquo;
