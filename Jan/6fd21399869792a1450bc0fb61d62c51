TWO IVORY Park tenants were robbed of their belongings on Christmas Eve. The tenants believe the man, whom they call the December thug, is the same man who hit the same household last year. According to Adam Khangale (24), one of the victims, the man came to their yard pretending to be looking for one of the tenants named James. &ldquo;We told him he was not around but he said he would wait for him. We were relaxing in front of the landlord&rsquo;s house having some beers when the man joined us.&rdquo; He said after a while the man asked for the toilet. Frank Magwale (27) said it took them a while to realise the man had not come back.&ldquo;I went to check on him but he was nowhere to be found. I then went to my room, only to find the door wide open.&rdquo; According to the two, a similar incident reportedly took place around at the same time last year.The December thug apparently stole five pairs of Carvela shoes, five pairs of jeans, a laptop, a bag, three T-shirts, brand new children&rsquo;s clothing and a six pack of beers from Adam&rsquo;s room.

The victims alleged that the goods stolen amount to about R36 000.The suspect is believed to be from Bogom in Limpopo.Ivory Park cops have confirmed the incident and said a case of theft has been opened and are investigating.
