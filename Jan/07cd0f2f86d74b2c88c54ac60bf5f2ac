SIBONGISENI Mbhele (26) from J section in Umlazi, south of Durban, was taken to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital on Thursday by his family.But the following day he had mysteriously disappeared. His uncle, Dumisani Mbhele (53), told Daily Sun that he was shocked when he returned to the hospital the next day only to be told his nephew was missing. Mbhele said that nurses in the ward told him that Sibongiseni disappeared during visiting hours and nurses believed he followed people who were visiting their relatives. He said he could not accept the explanation because he didn&rsquo;t understand how nurses could allow a mentally disturbed patient to escape.&ldquo;My nephew&rsquo;s condition got worse and he became violent. He also tried to run away but we managed to catch him, tie him up and take him to hospital,&rdquo; said Dumisani.He said that he wanted to know how the man escaped without being noticed by security guards, because he was wearing a hospital gown. Dumisani said the hospital was negligent and called for the security system to be changed. &ldquo;What angers me most was the lies of the hospital officials, who said they had already opened a case.&rdquo; He said he went to the police station on Friday and asked whether the hospital had reported his nephew missing. &ldquo;They told me that there was no case reported. I then opened the case and was given a case number,&rdquo; said Dumisani.Agiza Hlongwane from the KZN Department of Health said that the department was still collecting details regarding the matter.Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN police spokesman, said Sibongiseni was reported to have absconded from the hospital by the sister in charge.However, Dumisani insisted that he opened the case on Friday.
