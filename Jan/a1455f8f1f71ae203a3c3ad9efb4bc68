WORKERS at Tokologo Municipality in Boshof, outside Bloemfontein got a surprise welcome on Monday morning. They found rubbish thrown at the entrance to their office. The rubbish was allegedly thrown there by gatvol residents after the rubbish was not picked up for weeks. A passerby said: &ldquo;I was coming to work when I saw a group of mlungus with their vehicles in front of the municipal offices, offloading rubbish in black bags. &ldquo;They threw the rubbish at the entrance to the building and left. &ldquo;When workers arrived they could not enter the premises. First they had to clean up the mess.&rdquo; One waste removal worker said people dumped the rubbish because there was no removal service at the correct times and dates. &ldquo;We are understaffed. We have to work in the townships and in the suburbs at the same time. &ldquo;The workload is too much. The municipality does not want to hire enough people.&rdquo; Caswell Tlhokwe, Tokologo municipal spokesman, confirmed that the main entrance was blocked.&ldquo;A group of people allegedly threw rubbish bags there to prevent officials from gaining entry.&rdquo;&ldquo;We will be having a meeting during the day to find a way forward to deal with this matter.&ldquo; I am aware of the staff shortages and we intend to advertise posts very soon.&rdquo;
