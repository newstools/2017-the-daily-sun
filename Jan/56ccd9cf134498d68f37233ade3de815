STRUGGLING Baroka FC have traded Polokwane&rsquo;s Peter Mokaba Stadium for the 20 000-seater Giyani Stadium for all their remaining home matches in the second round of the Premier Soccer League.The move to Giyani, a stadium used by Black Leopards, was revealed yesterday by Bakgaga&rsquo;s new technical director, Mark Harrison.Baroka lost all eight of their Absa Premiership matches played at their former home ground, the Peter Mokaba Stadium, after they won promotion from the National First Division (NFD) last May.&ldquo;If we had won just two or three of our home matches in the first round we would not be sitting at the bottom of the table,&rdquo; said Harrison. &ldquo;We decided to move to Giyani as it is not a nice place for teams to visit. We are going to make life as difficult as possible for visiting teams.&rdquo;Harrison, a former MP Black Aces and Chippa United head coach, was brought into the Baroka coaching setup along with new Zambian head coach Jacob Sekala to stop the rot.Former head coach Kgoloko Thobejane, who guided the club to promotion by winning the NFD, was demoted to assistant coach earlier this month.Baroka&rsquo;s first match in Giyani will be on 15 February when they host Platinum Stars. But first they have to travel to Port Elizabeth on 7 February when the season resumes for an away clash against Chippa at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
