THE controversial Charles Hlengwa High School has performed poorly once again for the class of Matric 2016. Of its 18 matric pupils who are supposed to have written the exams, only four managed to pass, and their parents are disappointed because they did not gain admission to university. Last year the school in Illovo, KZN, had a 0% pass rate and in 2014 only one pupil passed. Zaza Cele (47), a parent, said: &ldquo;We worked hard to assist the teachers in various ways. We were certain the tables would turn.&rdquo; Early last year, parents cited a lack of learning resources and laziness among teachers as the reason for poor results. - Folweni and Siphephele high schools, which were affected by residents&rsquo; five-month strike over a candidate councillor disagreement, obtained a pass rate of more than 50%.&nbsp; At Ntwenhle Secondary School, only 20 of 80 pupils passed.&nbsp; - In Eastern Cape the Congress of South African Students and the DA were not impressed with the province&rsquo;s improvement from 56,8% in 2015 to 59,3%. Cosas blames Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle for not holding education MEC Mandla Makupula accountable for the 70% target he set in 2014.&nbsp; However, Siyabonga Mdodi, SACP provincial spokesman, said the party welcomed the 2,5% improvement.&nbsp; Samkele Mqai, Cosas provincial secretary, said they were disappointed with the less than 5% increase. &ldquo;It is not worth celebrating as it is far less than what was achieved in 2014,&rdquo; said Mqai.&nbsp; Mqai said the continuous neglect of schools in rural areas was the reason the province was the worst performer.&nbsp; Edmund van Vuuren, DA member of Parliament, said: &ldquo;We are the worst performing province, with the five worst performing districts, each obtaining less than 50%. &ldquo;Our pupils are being let down by the education department&rsquo;s failure to meet its own targets and plans.&rdquo; Eastern Cape department of education MEC Mandla Makupula said: &ldquo;We need to intensify focus on quality teaching and learning.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must come up with combative measures to support teaching and learning at the classroom level.&rdquo; &ldquo;The EC has conducted a clean and credible examination with no reports of leakages or copying in 2016. In Total 82756 learners wrote exams on a full time bassis and 49 042 learners passed. This translates to 59.3% and 2.5% increase from 56.8% in 2015. The province bounced back to yts upward trajectory. (although we could not fully recover the 8.6% decline of 2015.&nbsp; Makupula added like there is a number one province there must also be one at the bottom. Unfortunately Eastern Cape was one of those at the bottom.&nbsp;
