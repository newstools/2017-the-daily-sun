SINCE she was hit by a speeding car on the way to work on Sunday morning, Lungile Ngcobo&rsquo;s family has been in a lot of pain. According to witnesses, the 23-year-old from Villa Liza squatter camp in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni was walking on the side of the road when a car, allegedly driven by a drunk man in his 20s, ploughed into her, killing her instantly. Her mum, Khuthalaphi Makhunga (57), couldn&rsquo;t hold back her tears when she spoke to Daily Sun about her loss. She said Lungile was the breadwinner and had just found a new job. &ldquo;She always took care of me. She was building me a two-roomed house back home in KZN when she lost her former job.&rdquo;Khuthalaphi is unemployed and survives on the money she makes from recycling. She said Lungile came to Joburg in December to find a job to finish the house. &ldquo;When she got here, my friend quickly got her a job. She had been working at a shop in Dawn Park for two weeks and had not yet received her first pay cheque. &ldquo;Right now we don&rsquo;t even know how we will bury her as we aren&rsquo;t financially stable.&rdquo; She said the family&rsquo;s wish was to send Lungile&rsquo;s body to KZN for a dignified burial. &ldquo;Why did this have to happen, especially in January? &ldquo;I curse this year,&rdquo; said the devastated mum. Dawn Park police spokeswoman, Constable Kemeleng Mabula, said cases of culpable homicide and drunk driving were opened at the station.She added a suspect was arrested and appeared in Boksburg Magistrates Court on Monday. He was not asked to plead and will appear in court again next week.
