MOLEMO &ldquo;Jub Jub&rdquo; Maarohanye is in demand by major local record labels.This follows his release from jail on parole on Thursday, alongside his accomplice Themba Tshabalala.Jub Jub has written and released his single, Ke Kopa Tshwarelo, featuring singer, Tsepo Tshola.A record label executive, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed that his team started working on signing Jub Jub last year.&ldquo;Not because we want to be associated with what he did in his past, but because he&rsquo;s a talented artist and song-writer.&ldquo;Everything came to a halt in December. But now we&rsquo;re back on track and hope he chooses us,&rdquo; he said.Another music industry figure told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I think Jub Jub&rsquo;s fans are expecting great music from him and we all want to be part of his comeback.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only a business decision, but a matter of giving a man who has shown remorse a second chance at life,&rdquo; said the source.Jub Jub&rsquo;s release from prison set social media ablaze, even though news reports had earlier confirmed that he could be home for Christmas.Jub Jub and Themba were originally found guilty on 16 October, 2012 of murder, attempted murder, driving under the influence of drugs, and drag racing on a public road.They had crashed their Mini Coopers into a group of schoolboys in Protea North, Soweto, on 8 March, 2010.In October 2014, their murder convictions were overturned and converted to culpable homicide.At the time, their sentences were reduced to 10 years, two of which were suspended.When approached for comment yesterday, Jub Jub&rsquo;s lawyer Rudi Krause told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Unfor-tunately, I don&rsquo;t deal with those aspects in relation to Molemo.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I can&rsquo;t be of assistance to you.&rdquo;
