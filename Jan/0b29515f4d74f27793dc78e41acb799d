ZIMBABWE&rsquo;S early exit from the Gabon Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) will most probably be a cause for celebration for most Absa Premiership clubs, who now get their players back sooner than hoped &ndash; and injury-free.Due to Afcon the PSL is currently on an extended six-week break, lasting from the festive season until 3 February. The Afcon final in Gabon will be played at the Stade de l&rsquo;Amiti&eacute; in Libreville on 5 February.At least nine PSL players are expected to arrive at their respective clubs before the end of the week, which means coaches will have almost two weeks to work with a full squad.Warriors captain Willard Katsande, who has dropped a bombshell on his coach, Kalisto Pasuwa, by retiring from international football with immediate effect, is set to return to his club Kaizer Chiefs tomorrow.&nbsp;Warriors&nbsp;spokesman Xolani Gwesela said, however, that they were still waiting for &ldquo;official correspondence from him&rdquo;.It was an emotional retirement for the Chiefs midfielder, as it came on the back of a 4-2 loss to Tunisia in their final Afcon group match on Monday.There has also been reports that coach Pasuwa might quit too, but he is apparently planning to sit down with Zim Football Association president Phillip Chayangwa to discuss it first.The star-studded&nbsp;Warriors&nbsp;have been such a disappointment in Gabon, failing to win a single match. They drew 2-2 with Algeria, lost 2-0 to Senegal and then 4-2 to Tunisia.It is a terrible record that Pasuwa would surely like to forget quickly. The coach has said they are all to blame.Also making a return to the PSL is Danny Phiri and Kudukwashi Mahachi, who will bolster Clinton Larsen&rsquo;s Golden Arrows, while Khama Billiat and Denis Onyango are expected rejoin Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s training camp in Rustenburg tomorrow.New Maritzburg United coach Roger de Sa can expect Evans Rusike sometime this week, while Tendai Ndoro of Orlando Pirates is sure to receive a warm welcome when he arrives at camp.Bidvest Wits&rsquo; Gavin Hunt will be glad to have Cuthbert Malajila back as they have a tough encounter against Pirates at Ellis Park on 3 February.The Afcon axe has been coming down on underperforming clubs since the start of the week. Hosts Gabon discovered they could not rely solely on the skills of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who ended up blaming lack of experience for their downfall.Algeria, Guinea-Bissau and Onyango&rsquo;s side, Uganda, were the first teams to be booted from this year&rsquo;s tournament.Zimbabwe players have blamed inexperience for their exit too.Pasuwa said: &ldquo;We lost concentration when it mattered most. But we have also learned a lot about maintaining maximum concentration in such games.&rdquo;Katsande blamed imbalances in the team who only regained form late in the tournament.&ldquo;Still, it was a good learning experience,&rdquo; the player said.&ldquo;We just have to take on board the positives. Now we know what it feels like to be in such a big tournament. Life must go on.&rdquo;
