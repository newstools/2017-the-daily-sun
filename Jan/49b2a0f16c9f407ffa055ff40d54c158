WHEN a Good Samaritan, Siphokazi Sechevu (28), saw people struggling, she wanted to make a difference. She decided to donate food parcels to the residents of Block V in Soshanguve, Tshwane.But her plan was crushed when unruly residents ambushed and looted the four trucks that she had organised to deliver the parcels.She said when they arrived at the organised venue, some residents became greedy and started attacking the four trucks.Siphokazi said she had a list of people whom she had identified as beneficiaries.She had made arrangements to bring them food parcels donated by an organisation in Tshwane.&ldquo;When I found people who were willing to help, I was happy because I knew there were people who were in need of the food and would appreciate the gesture.&rdquo; But sadly her plans fell apart.She said she brought the food parcels anticipating a joyful welcome but instead, she was met with violence from residents. &ldquo;Before we could unpack the parcels, the residents started to attack us. &ldquo;They took the food in the trucks, leaving nothing for the people on the list.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect people to react the way they did. I wish there had been some order so that everyone could have had their fair share.&rdquo; She said she will look for an alternative way to distribute the food to the identified community members.&ldquo;Maybe we will have police escort us or we will have to go door to door.&rdquo; One of the residents on the list, Rita Phetla (55), said it was unfortunate that the residents behaved the way they did.She said she was unemployed and was counting on the food parcels to feed her kids. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get anything. What worries me is that they might not come back. &ldquo;We need every little donation we can get.&rdquo;
