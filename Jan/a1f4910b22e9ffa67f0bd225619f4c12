THE PROTEAS’ new fast bowling Twenty20 cap, Lungi Ngidi, hopes to
add another milestone to his fast-moving cricket career in the upcoming T20
International series against Sri Lanka, starting at SuperSport Park in
Centurion today.The
20-year-old has had a dream run over the last couple of months after making his
debut for the Titans in the CSA T20 Challenge this season. He was named Bowler
of the Match in the six-run victory in the final and hopes to take his
performances onto the international stage.“I
wouldn’t say that I expected it sooner but the journey has been amazing for me.
Everything has unfolded quickly,” Ngidi said ahead of the squad’s first
training session on Tuesday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssodKsnYsyba_6rtvz-KTdms1OcebA5O7CThTCNSExoO9vy2XwB9IuC0L5mahrjzOy06kKBiPRhhcu_-ym6DE6Pya4HeGYK9pPxp837CCVjuLvfd_jfqZg8A1sQCq1nSfO5HjRL27whhxE5D3rDQDzaY-sCmOxehJhOVruobBVNl9wktC5lQRSTSlAoVPQSNeTjXQOV06e1S2KUD1HILfFJ9x57MXCAtl9uzGQ8I9di2DBOYFpJsOUcobXW_gzWyhzKY5SFFFT6USNPtBad\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHnu8smc-rcFEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

put in a few performances here and there but the coaches were always reminding
me that consistency is the best thing.“That is
what I’ve tried to do, one step at a time. I tried to be as consistent as
possible and the performances came naturally with playing well.”Ngidi
has made significant strides since his Player of the Tournament award in the
inaugural Africa T20 Cup in 2015, and has gone on to make his Sunfoil Series
and CSA T20 Challenge debuts this season.He has
given due credit for his fast rise up the ladder to former Titans coach, Rob
Walter, who gave him his first opportunity to play domestic cricket. He also
hailed current coach, Mark Boucher, who has helped him understand the
requirements and pressures that come with playing for South Africa.“A lot
of credit goes to the coaching staff and the players,” he said. “They were the
ones who backed me in terms of putting me in at such a young age. They gave me
the opportunity to play in the CSA T20 Challenge last year and I managed to
perform decently, which then opened the door to the senior side.“Rob
Walter picked me up from the amateur side. I had been playing varsity cricket
and he spotted me there, and that is when I got into the amateur team. He
kick-started my franchise career, he had a massive influence.”The
former Hilton College pupil is another sterling product of the Cricket South
Africa development pipeline, having risen through the levels, from
KwaZulu-Natal age-group cricket to CSA Cubs Week and the SA Under-19s before
establishing himself at franchise level. – CRICKETSA
