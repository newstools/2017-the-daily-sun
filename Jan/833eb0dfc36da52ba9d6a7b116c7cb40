THEY are known as the Anti-booze Gang and their motto is: &ldquo;Thou shall NOT drink!&rdquo;Two tavern owners from Duduza, Ekurhuleni, were killed last week and two are in hospital. Other tavern owners are living in fear as they don&rsquo;t know who will be the next target.Residents said the gang kills tavern owners because, they claim, the taverns promote drinking and alcoholism.A tavern owner told Daily Sun he is even thinking of closing down his tavern.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared because we don&rsquo;t know these people. We only know that they move in a group of four and come at closing time,&rdquo; said one tavern owner.Zakharia Beka, a resident, said they didn&rsquo;t know which religion the gang supports. &ldquo;But it is annoying that they impose their beliefs on other people. Leave those who drink alone and read your Bible.&rdquo;Sergeant Harry Manaka told Daily Sun the gang has been evading the cops for a while. Cops are appealing to the public to help them find them.&ldquo;We urge local business owners to be extra careful after closing at night. &ldquo;Joseph Ndlovu, a prominent businessman, was shot dead on New Year&rsquo;s Eve at his business when three armed men forced entry and shot him in the chest.&rdquo; He said a case of murder and robbery was opened. Manaka confirmed three other tavern owners were shot: one died and two are still in hospital.He also urged tavern operators to upgrade their security.Residents who can help must contact the police on these numbers: 071 675 7028, 071 675 7230 and 071 675 6978.
