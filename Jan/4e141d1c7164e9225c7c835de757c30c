&ldquo;No unauthorised kak in our toilets ever again!&rdquo;That was the warning from the people of Jerusalem squatter camp in Roodepoort, Joburg. Angry residents told Daily Sun their settlement is situated next to a footpath leading to Main Reef Road, where people take taxis.The kasi people say passers-by use their toilets. They have no problem with that. But they&rsquo;re fuming because these people leave the toilets in a filthy mess. Community member Xolani Xaba (48) told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Those people are ungrateful. They shit all over the toilet, and leave us to clean up their mess. &ldquo;We tolerated it for a while, thinking maybe it was just a mistake &ndash; but the habit continued.&ldquo;These are the only toilets we have and we can&rsquo;t leave them dirty. If we don&rsquo;t clean them we&rsquo;re the ones who will end up living like pigs or even getting sick.&rdquo; Now the people of Jerusalem keep the toilets locked, and no unauthorised person can use them.Community leader Simon Thungo told the SunTeam: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got about 100 toilets in the area and we decided that two families will share one toilet. They must lock them up and take care of them,&rdquo; said Simon.He said no one is able to use a toilet unless authorised by the family in charge of it.While Daily Sun was chatting to the kasi people, John Kodwa (40) arrived. When asked, he said he lives in Dobsonville and passes Jerusalem every day, on his way to and from work.&ldquo;We know these are their kasi toilets, but they used to help us a lot, when we needed to relieve ourselves as we passed Jerusalem.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few culprits who messed up the toilets. They wanted to ruin things for us,&rdquo; he said.John appealed to the community: &ldquo;Spare one toilet for us and we will keep it clean ourselves. Because you never know when or where you might need to go.&rdquo;John and the kasi people didn&rsquo;t come to an agreement, but the residents promised to think about a solution to the problem.
