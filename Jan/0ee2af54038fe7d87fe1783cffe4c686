THE SA Football Association (Safa) legal team is in for an unpleasant start to the year as it faces two major challenges in court, from axed Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba and Black Leopards boss David Thidiela respectively.The men from the northern province of the country have vowed to fight tooth and nail to embarrass Safa in their respective cases.Mashaba&rsquo;s legal representative, Claudio Bollo, told SunSport yesterday that their documents were ready to be submitted to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to kick off their attempt to get 66-year-old Mashaba reinstated.&ldquo;Within the next 24 hours the paperwork will be through to the CCMA. My client was treated unfairly while he had a contract and should be reinstated,&rdquo; Bollo said yesterday.Mashaba is not the only continuous headache for Safa. Thidiela is also challenging the association after being summoned to appear in a disciplinary hearing on 20 January.Daily Sun&rsquo;s sister paper City Press reported on Sunday that Thidiela&rsquo;s charge sheet says he &ldquo;behaved in a disorderly manner (and) threatened and used discriminatory words against a match official&rdquo; during a National First Division game between Leopards and Royal Eagles on 17 December.Thidiela referred all enquiries to his lawyers for clarity when contacted for comment yesterday, but they were unavailable for comment.However, a source very close to the developments said Thidiela planned on appearing before the Safa DC and later on challenging it to investigate all his allegations.&ldquo;I guess Thidiela has a case. Why is Safa not investigating complaints from club officials about referees, but instead charging the complainants?&rdquo; our mole asked.&ldquo;He has vowed to fight Safa this time around, even taking his case to Fifa and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).&rdquo;
