THE Dumisa family is living in fear of their son after they handed him over to the cops and he escaped from custody. They are scared Luvo Dumisa (31) will try to take revenge on them. This was after he and five other accused allegedly overpowered a cop and escaped from Mount Frere Magistrates Court, Eastern Cape on Wednesday. The suspects had appeared in court on charges of murder, assault, robbery and theft. Some of them were applying for bail, while others had been denied bail during previous appearances. According to a source who witnessed the incident, the suspects were not handcuffed as they were being led back to the holding cells. &ldquo;One suspect grabbed the cop in the courtroom. The others joined in and beat the officer. They then took his firearm and escaped through the back entrance,&rdquo; said the source. A member of the Dumisa family said: &ldquo;My brother is involved with very dangerous people and if they have a gun, they have something big planned.&rdquo; She said the family had been taken to a place of safety after Dumisa threatened to burn their home and kill his mum. Police spokesman Captain Mlungisi Matidane said they had managed to rearrest two suspects after their families turned them in.
