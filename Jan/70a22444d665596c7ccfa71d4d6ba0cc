BENNI McCARTHY says he&rsquo;s too young to consider coaching Bafana Bafana at this stage. Many Mzansi football fans have been crying for a fresh, new approach in the Bafana set-up.McCarthy is Bafana&rsquo;s all-time leading goal-scorer, with 31 goals in his illustrious career.Although McCarthy was never in the running for the job, he says he will consider it at a later stage in his coaching career because he first wants to learn the ropes by working at club level.He has just obtained his Uefa A coaching diploma and will now start sending out his CV to get his coaching career going.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too young to coach Bafana. I would want to start at club level to learn quickly every day.&ldquo;The Bafana job is for established coaches like Gavin Hunt or Pitso Mosimane.&ldquo;At national level, you sit for two months without coaching and when matches come, pressure can be unbearable.&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m ruling myself out of this because I want to work every day and show my passion,&rdquo; said McCarthy.McCarthy added that he&rsquo;s been getting enquiries from some clubs but he would be very keen to start his new vocation in Mzansi.He told SunSport: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for a chairperson who is willing to take a risk with me because good players don&rsquo;t necessarily mean they will become good coaches.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for a club boss who will be brave enough while I continue studying further to obtain coaching badges.&ldquo;A Premier Soccer League club would be an ideal place to start.&ldquo;You have to start somewhere,&rdquo; said McCarthy.&ldquo;Gavin was given a chance at Seven Stars and Pitso at SuperSport United, and they turned out to be the best in the country.&ldquo;You need a chance and people to believe in you.&rdquo;McCarthy added that he&rsquo;s had a few offers with people asking him about his availability.&ldquo;A club in Georgia have made an enquiry.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m looking for. I want to start where I can build a name for myself &ndash; at the right club and right country.&rdquo;The Hanover Park, Cape Town-born striker said it was an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as Hunt, Mosimane and Shaun Bartlett when it came to coaching qualifications.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to be part of the elite, selected group of Mzansi coaches.&ldquo;I took a different route because I played at a later stage than the coaches I have mentioned.&ldquo;Very few of our coaches have those badges. It&rsquo;s only foreign coaches who have those badges,&rdquo; he added.&ldquo;I want to continue my legacy.&rdquo;
