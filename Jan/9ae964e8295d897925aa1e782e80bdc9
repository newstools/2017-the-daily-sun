THE gap between rich and the poor is widening, with the world&rsquo;s richest eight men owning the same wealth as the poorest half of the world, research by Oxfam reveals.In its latest inequality report, An economy for the 99%, the organisation explains that three-quarters of extreme poverty could be eliminated by using existing resources, increasing taxation and cutting down on military and &ldquo;other regressive&rdquo; spending.&ldquo;Our economy must stop excessively rewarding those at the top and start working for all people,&rdquo; the report stated. It called for accountable and visionary governments, and businesses that work in the interests of workers and producers.Among the findings, research showed that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. Furthermore, the incomes of the poorest 10% of people increased by less than $3 a year between 1988 and 2011. This contrasts with the incomes of the rich, which increased 182 times.The World Bank has raised concerns that world leaders may not meet their goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.Oxfam listed tax evasion through the use of tax havens, corporations that work to benefit those at the top at the expense of those at the bottom and poor wages for workers as contributing factors.The report proposes an economy redesign which benefits the world&rsquo;s 99%, and not just the 1% who enjoy extreme wealth.&ldquo;Humanity has incredible talent, huge wealth and infinite imagination. We need to put this to work to create a more human economy that benefits everyone, not just the privileged few,&rdquo; the report stated.&nbsp;http://www.fin24.com/Economy/wealth-shock-8-men-own-same-as-half-of-worlds-poorest-20170116
