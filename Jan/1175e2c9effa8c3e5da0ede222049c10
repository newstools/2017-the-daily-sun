Komolodowicz is the director of Crimetech Laboratories, a supplier of forensic services to the police. Phahlane and Komolodowicz have reportedly denied there’s anything improper about them doing private business deals.As part of the investigation, Ipid has allegedly been interviewing witnesses to determine how Phahlane could afford to build his R8 million house.
