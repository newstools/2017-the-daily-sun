THESE livestock owners are very worried about the brutal killing of their cows. The owners from Mandlanzini, near Richard&rsquo;s Bay on the north coast of KZN, said in one week five cows had been shot dead in the area. The most recent incident was on Friday when a cow that had been shot in the head was found. The owners told Daily Sun the killings started on Wednesday when two suspects on motorcycles opened fire on a herd, killing four cows. Thembinkosi Mdluli (58) &ndash; who was herding the cows &ndash; said he survived the shooting by hiding in the bush. &ldquo;I saw two men shooting at the herd. When I went to check on the cows after they left, I found four cows were dead. I called for help.&rdquo; Zwelisha Buthelezi (54), the owner of the four cows, said he feared he would lose more animals. &ldquo;The shootings scare me because I&rsquo;m unemployed and my family relies on the money I make by selling cows. &ldquo;One of my kids has registered at a tertiary institution with the money I made from selling three cows.&rdquo; Umhlambi Livestock Association chairman, Dubula Lukhele, said they were organising a meeting to come up with solutions. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know why the cows are being killed,&rdquo; he said. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;A case of cruelty to animals was opened at Richards Bay cop shop.&rdquo;
