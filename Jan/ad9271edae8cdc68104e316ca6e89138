PUPILS will suffer now after burglars burned down four classrooms! It happened two weeks ago at Phogole Primary School at Makwassie, near Wolmaransstad in North West.People believe the intruders set fire to the school in anger after failing to find any computers and tablets to steal.Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said: &ldquo;A case of arson has been opened for investigation but no one has been arrested so far.&rdquo; Education and sports development spokesman Freddy Sepeng said: &ldquo;A block of four classrooms was burnt down. &ldquo;Furniture and the administration block were severely damaged.&ldquo;A resident reportedly saw smoke coming from the school at 1.30pm and immediately alerted neighbours, who called the police and firefighters,&rdquo; he said.Sepeng added the criminals gained entry by breaking the burglar bars of the administration block and then disconnected the alarm system. They allegedly used a grinding machine to destroy the strongroom door and vandalise the reception area.&ldquo;They targeted tablets and computers but fortunately, the school kept them elsewhere in a safe place. &ldquo;On failing to get the electronic gadgets, the criminals resorted to burning the school.&rdquo;He added that thugs recently stole tablets and computers from Atlarelang Primary School in the same township, using the same methods. According to Sepeng, the damage is estimated at R2 million. The department plans to provide temporary classrooms when the school reopens. North West Education MEC Sello Lehari said: &ldquo;I am calling upon the law to arrest those individuals who feed themselves by stealing property intended to develop children in schools. &ldquo;It is heartbreaking to see criminals destroying the future of our children at the expense of government and taxpayers,&rdquo; said Lehari. &ndash; AENS
