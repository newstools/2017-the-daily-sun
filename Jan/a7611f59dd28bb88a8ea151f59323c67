THE 8% moratorium on 2017 fees also applies to TVET students whose family income is below R600 000 per year.This was announced by Blade Nzimande, Minister of Higher Education and Training, at a media briefing in Tshwane yesterday.This comes after the department received a memorandum of grievances from the South African FET Students Association. Nzimande met Higher Education stakeholders to discuss preparations for the 2017 academic year. He said that the engagements gave him confidence about the prospects for higher education this year.&ldquo;Many challenges which affected the sector in 2016 are being substantially addressed, including the issue of fees. We have discussed a number of interventions needed to assist students who come from poor and working class families.&ldquo;We remain committed to releasing a significant portion of a fee adjustment grant, up to a cap of 8%, to universities and colleges in the first quarter of the year to assist them with the cash flow challenges that they face.&rdquo; He said the government&rsquo;s commitment to higher education is demonstrated, in part, by the substantial increases in funding to the NSFAS since 2010.&ldquo;We remain committed to finding the resources to support the children of all poor, working class and middle class families in their quest to better their lives and those of their families through skills acquisition.&rdquo; Nzimande said government has also addressed the issue of the historical debt of students qualifying for the NSFAS who were registered last year.These were students who were successful in their studies, but had accumulated debt.&ldquo;They will be allowed to register in 2017,&rdquo; he said.
