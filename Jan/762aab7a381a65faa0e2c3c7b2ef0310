The winger is expected to put pen to paper on terms when he arrives in the country sometime on Friday.Nonetheless, it appears Dolly will be signing for La Paillade imminently as he begins a new chapter of his career in Europe. The player made nearly 60 appearances during his time with the Brazilians.
