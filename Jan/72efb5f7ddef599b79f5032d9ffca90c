GOOD leaders are expected to lead by example and at Afcon 2017 captains have already showed at Stade de l Amitie in Libreville why they re the ones wearing armbands .In what may not be an outright battle for who can be the best, the captains have outdone themselves in a bid to ensure that their countries come out on top.First up was Gabon s poster boy and captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang whose 51st minute goal past Guinea-Bissau s goalkeeper Jonas Mendes sent the crowd into frenzy.There could not have been a better script than for Aubameyang, who has been extraordinary at club level with Dortmund, to rise to the occasion and score the tournament s first goal and restoring faith among the fans.Everything was on course for a dream start until a stoppage time goal from Juary Marinho Soares ruined what could have been a perfect day for Gabonese football following a great display at the opening ceremony.In the shadow of the two goal scorers was Guinea-Bissau captain Jose Luis Mendes Lopes who controlled the tempo of the game, connecting the defence to their attack and rallying his teammates to maintain their focus and avoid conceding as they sought an equalizer.Lopes was officially named man-of-the-match for the tournament opener and rightly so as the debutant team s draw will go down as a memorable day in Guinea-Bissau s history.In the second game of the day between four-time African champions Cameroon and Afcon 2013 runners up Burkina Faso, the captains were once again in the spotlight.Cameroon s Benjamin Moukandjo, who has quickly become a dependable player for the Indomitable Lions, looked the part when he opened their scoring in the 34th minute with a well-taken free kick past goalkeeper Kouakou Koffi.Burkinabe captain Charles Kabor was not one to be left out as his display kept his side in the run for a place in the quarterfinals.Burkina Faso take on hosts Gabon in their next tie on 18 January, while Cameroon will be up against Guinea Bissau.
