ACTING on a tip-off, cops raided a homecoming event for a large group of initiates and found illegal firearms.Two initiates will appear in the Sebokeng Magistrates Court today after they were bust with illegal weapons over the weekend.A joint operation by the Sedibeng police cluster, the K9 unit, the flying squad and officials from the Sedibeng Municipality led to the raiding of an initiation school in extension 15 of Sebokeng in the Vaal on Friday.Yusuf Mahommed, the municipality&rsquo;s public safety MMC, said the operation was a success.He added that the raids would continue until the end of the month.&ldquo;When these boys return from these camps, they start joining gangs,&rdquo; said Mahommed.&ldquo;They eventually go on to form their own gangs, which is why the number of gangs in the area increases every year.&ldquo;We were told these boys were carrying a large number of illegal guns, but we only managed to find two.&rdquo;Residents told cops they heard gunshots on the night before the bust.They said it sounded like someone was firing shots into the air.Cops and government officials have had their hands full since last month after the CRL Rights Commission suspended the summer initiation season. This follows the deaths of gang members in violence related to initiation schools.Traditional surgeons who defied the ban had their camps raided and shut down, and the initiates were returned to the care of their parents.Despite the ban, several traditional surgeons opened schools last month, with many initiates coming home to graduation feasts.Police spokeswoman Sergeant Gertrude Makhale said two suspects were charged with possession of an illegal firearm.&ldquo;Two suspects have been arrested and will appear at the Sebokeng Magistrates Court today.&rdquo;
