IN past years, some matric students in KZN who failed killed themselves. Departmental spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said that KZN Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana had asked matriculants to remember that failure is not a dead end. He said the department has put measures in place to ease the pressure on those who don&rsquo;t make it. Mahlambi said the MEC also urged parents to be supportive of their kids. Minister of Basic Education Dr Angie Motshekga will announce the results on SABC1 at 6pm today. The KZN department will hold its results announcement ceremony tomorrow at 9am at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre.
