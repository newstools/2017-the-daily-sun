HE WAS the last to arrive at the house where his family members were being held hostage.&nbsp; But he was the first one to be shot dead! Safas Dube (33) walked into the house not even knowing that death was waiting for him inside.&nbsp; Captain Stephen Thakeng of Wesselsbron police said the incident happened on Sunday night.&nbsp; Thakeng said Safas had no idea that his five family members, including a child, had been held hostage for almost three hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;He arrived at the house and was also held hostage at gunpoint by seven armed suspects. They allegedly demanded R45&thinsp;000 from him,&rdquo; said Thakeng.&nbsp; &ldquo;The robbers then phoned Safas&rsquo; brother and said he had to pay the R45&thinsp;000 if he wanted to see his brother alive again. Unfortunately for the victim, when the suspects fled the scene they drove away in a black Toyota Yaris with him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The vehicle was later found abandoned with the victim fatally shot inside,&rdquo; said Thakeng.&nbsp; The other getaway car was a, silver BMW with registration number FRS 685 FS.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact detective Constable James Letube of Wesselsbron Detective Services on 072&thinsp;237&thinsp;6516,&rdquo; said Thakeng, adding that police have also afforded the family protection as the suspects are still at large.
