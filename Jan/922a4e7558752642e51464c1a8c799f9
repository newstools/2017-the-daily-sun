THE RELENTLESS demands for success at Real Madrid have cost many high-profile and greatly experienced coaches their jobs, but Zinedine Zidane has made the move into senior management look serene as he celebrates a year in charge at the European and world champions.Madrid were a club with a very different feel 12 months ago when Zidane was promoted from his post as coach of Real&rsquo;s youth team Castilla. It was a salvage operation by club president Florentino Perez to rescue a disastrous campaign as Rafael Benitez lasted just seven months in the Santiago Bernabeu hot seat.Zidane won everything from the Champions League to the World Cup as one of the greatest players of his generation. Yet, even by those standards, his rapid rise as a coach has been breathtaking.The Frenchman has won more trophies (three) than he has suffered defeats (two) in his first 53 games in charge.After adding the Club World Cup to the Champions League and European Super Cup to end 2016, Zidane celebrated his first anniversary in charge at home to Sevilla last night in the Copa del Rey Last 16 &ndash; on a club record 37-game unbeaten run.&ldquo;Zidane changed our lives last year,&rdquo; Perez was quoted as saying.Despite being very much the president&rsquo;s man, Zidane hasn&rsquo;t been bowed by Perez&rsquo;s often perceived desire for the starting line-up to be determined by the number of shirts sold by his Galactico signings.Zidane&rsquo;s status as a former world great and ability to still pull off a spectacular touch in training, means he has also won the hearts and minds of Real&rsquo;s ego-driven dressing-room, which many of his predecessors, particularly Benitez, failed to cope with.The target is for Zidane to deliver Real&rsquo;s most successful ever season by becoming the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years and knock Barcelona off their perch as La Liga&rsquo;s dominant side in the past decade.Real enjoy a comfortable three-point lead and a game in hand over Barcelona in the title race and are heavy favourites to see off Napoli in the Last 16 of the Champions League. &ndash; AFP
