HAVING had to man-mark Benni &ldquo;King Benni&rdquo; McCarthy every time Everton faced Blackburn Rovers between 2006 and 2009, former Nigeria skipper Joseph Yobo was always in close proximity to the South African striker.The duo will once again find themselves side by side, this time with a common goal as they team up to provide their expert opinion during SuperSport&rsquo;s broadcast of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) being hosted in Gabon.SuperSport will broadcast all 32 matches of the 14 January to 5 February tournament live.Matches will be spread across eight channels: SS4, SS5 (for South Africa), SS6, Maximo2, Maximo3, Maximo360, Select1 and Select2 (for the rest of the continent).
