NOSIVIWE Vuyelelo from Langa, Cape Town wants the women who scammed her to rot in jail.&nbsp; She said she was conned out of her handbag when she went shopping in Cape Town late last year.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was approached by a woman who told me they were having a clearance sale at a warehouse. While I was speaking to her, another woman came and said she was interested in the same sale. The woman then took us to a spot where five other women were waiting,&rdquo; said Nosiviwe.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when things went wrong.&nbsp; The woman told them only two customers were allowed to enter at a time.&nbsp; She also said they were not allowed to go in with their bags.&nbsp; &ldquo;When it was my turn to shop, I gave my bag to the woman. But when I went inside the shop, I was told there was no sale and the woman did not work there.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rushed outside to find the other women, but they were already gone. I think they were working together.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nosiviwe lost R500 as well as her ID and driver&rsquo;s licence.&nbsp; The shop owners checked their security cameras and Nosiviwe identified the thieves. When she wrote about her ordeal on Facebook, some people said they had also fallen victim to the same pair.&nbsp; Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;A case of theft has been opened for investigation.&rdquo;
