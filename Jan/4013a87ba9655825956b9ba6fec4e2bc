&ldquo;OUR children are not retarded!&rdquo;That is what the angry parents at Tiyelelani Secondary School in block M, Soshanguve in Tshwane said on Friday morning.The parents, accompanied by pupils, claimed some children had failed more than three times!The group said they held the march to find out why so many pupils at the school were failing. Prudence Nkosi (33) said her daughter had repeated grade 10 four times. &ldquo;She passed her major subjects, but they still said she failed. She improved in her subjects. She&rsquo;s done the same subjects for four years. How can she fail again?&rdquo; Prudence asked, adding she believed the principal was responsible for their kids&rsquo; poor results.&ldquo;My daughter has always complained about her teachers. She&rsquo;d come home crying every day, saying the teachers said she would fail every year.&rdquo;&ldquo;After we found out about their behaviour, we complained to the principal.&ldquo;She said we should apply for an appeal and come back on 20 January,&rdquo; said Prudence. So the parents went back to the school, but the principal said their children would have to repeat their grades.Prudence said they were not happy with the principal&rsquo;s decision and started shouting at him. &ldquo;He called the police to calm us down, as if we were doing something dangerous.&rdquo; Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said the department is upset over the disruption of learning at the school on Friday by a group of dissatisfied parents who wanted their children to be progressed to the next grades. &ldquo;Officials and the principal met with the parents on Monday. Parents were told to visit the district office where they will lodge an appeal through the assessments unit. The district unit will look at each case and advise the parents. &ldquo;We can confirm learning continued as normal today,&rdquo; he said.
