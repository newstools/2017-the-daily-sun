MAVEJI Mabaso (39) thought it was a good idea to marry two women on the same day, but his bride to be, Noxolo Khanyile (31) allegedly refused to share her shine with another woman.And that is apparently why she died.Maveji allegedly shot her dead before driving back to his home in Ezimfabeni, Ulundi, northern KZN and turning a gun on himself.Khanyile&rsquo;s relative said Maveji was rushed to a nearby hospital but he died on the way. &ldquo;The families met during the holidays and agreed on a huge wedding on 1 July, but Noxolo no longer wanted the wedding.&rdquo; Maveji&rsquo;s older brother, Jay Mabaso (42), confirmed his brother had two fiances for whom he had paid equal lobola.&ldquo;He wanted a huge white wedding where he would marry both of them on the same day. I don&rsquo;t know the circumstances around the incident because my brother didn&rsquo;t leave a note. &ldquo;What he did was totally unacceptable.&rdquo;Jay said the second fiance, Phiwe Shwala (32), had just sorted out her relationship with Maveji after being separated for a long time.&ldquo;We were really looking forward to the wedding,&rdquo; said Jay.Phiwe said she was almost killed as well.&ldquo;Maveji came to my house last week and throttled me until I could not breathe. He suddenly changed his mind and stopped. I forgive him now that he is dead.&rdquo; She said she was also against Maveji&rsquo;s marriage plans. &ldquo;I denied him an opportunity to negotiate the wedding date.&rdquo; Colonel Thembeka Mbhele, KZN police spokeswoman, said the motive for the shooting was that Noxolo had broken up with Maveji but he could not take it. &ldquo;A case of murder and an inquest docket were opened at Mahlabathini Police Station.&rdquo;
