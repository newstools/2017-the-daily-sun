ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has admitted there is no tradition dictating that the deputy president should automatically become president. However, he said deputy presidents were chosen with succession in mind. His statement came shortly after ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said on Gagasi FM: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rule to the effect that the deputy president should automatically become president.&rdquo; ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said Mantashe was not speaking about a particular individual but about succession and leadership in general. The statements come as members of the party have started supporting deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and outgoing chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed President Jacob Zuma. The two are expected to compete for the top job at the party&rsquo;s elective conference to be held in Gauteng in December. Dlamini-Zuma has already been endorsed by the ANC Women&rsquo;s League and reportedly has the backing of the powerful Premier League. Ramaphosa has not yet been endorsed by any ANC structure but has the backing of Cosatu. The trade union federation doesn&rsquo;t have voting delegates at ANC elective conferences but some members serve in ANC branches and could be delegates.
