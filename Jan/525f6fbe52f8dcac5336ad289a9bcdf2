WHEN people pass the corner of the Las Vegas taxi rank in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, they can&rsquo;t stop looking!This is because there is a very stylish vendor in the middle of the road, shouting out his wares to thirsty motorists.Brian Masuku (27) is the corner&rsquo;s main attraction as he goes about his business, selling ice lollies. He can be seen in his suits and other colourful attire &ndash; the kind of style that one does not expect on the street.Brian says it&rsquo;s all about respecting what he does so that he can be respected by his customers.&ldquo;Whether one sells items worth R2 or R10 000, one must always look good.&ldquo;It is all about respecting the job that I do, as well as respecting my customers and attracting more.&rdquo; Brian has been selling on the corner for the past four years and says there is nothing more pleasurable than interacting with his customers.Because of his dress code, he has became a motivational speaker in different schools around his area.When he is not on the street, he visits schools and teaches pupils about business and how to play a role in uplifting their communities.&ldquo;Yes, I have been approached by some teachers to come and share my ideas with the children. I always tell them that looking the part is one of the first things that people have to practise before anything else,&rdquo; he says.&ldquo;I may be selling ice lollies, but the response from customers is very positive.&rdquo; Ice lollies are not his only product. Brian also sells skop at his home &ndash; and there, too, he dresses for success!
