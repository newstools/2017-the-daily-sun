In attendance were dignitaries, including former president Thabo Mbeki, Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa.Lorraine said her mum must be pleased because &ldquo;she had a crush on statesman Thabo Mbeki&rdquo;. Mbeki said he didn&rsquo;t come to speak but to say farewell.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m absolutely saddened by her passing, but am glad that we honoured her with South Africa&rsquo;s Order of the Baobab in Gold for excellence, the achievement in and contribution to the art of music in 2006,&rdquo; he said.Her son, Roger Phambane, said most people didn&rsquo;t know about him, but all he remembers was a mum who taught him patience, love and chasing his dreams.Mthethwa urged people to support local artists to stop them from dying as paupers.&ldquo;Last year, the arts industry suffered great loss.
