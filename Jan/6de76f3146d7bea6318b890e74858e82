SHOCKED neighbours couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes when they rushed to fight a fire in an old woman&rsquo;s house.Lulu Bona (31) told Daily Sun when they opened the door of the burning house in extension 12 in Kagiso, Gauteng, they couldn&rsquo;t get in because it was stacked to the roof with sacks of rubbish.&ldquo;We usually see her going out with empty sacks to collect trash, and she comes back to the house every day.&rdquo; On Thursday, when the fire started, residents dragged as many of the bags out of the house as they could. It took seven emergency vehicles to put out the fire. Lulu said neighbours knew that the woman, known only as Kgomotso, had taken the furniture out of her house.&ldquo;I wonder how she sleeps in the house as there is no bed. &ldquo;We have spoken to councillors about the woman, but they didn&rsquo;t help us.&ldquo;They said they will provide a van and we can clean the house ourselves,&rdquo; Lulu said.A tenant in the yard said the place was full of cockroaches and rats and the area stinks from the rubbish.&ldquo;I have a young child who might get sick from the smell. &ldquo;When we try to talk to the old woman she gets angry and tells us it has nothing to do with us,&rdquo; said the tenant.Since the fire, Kgomotso has not been back in the yard.The SunTeam tried to get a comment from the Mogale City Municipality, but the spokesman was not available at the time of going to print.
