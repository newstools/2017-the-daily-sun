&lsquo;A PUNY struggling person", "A shrunken talkative joke", and now a "loud-mouthed Gucci revolutionary". President Robert Mugabe's government has launched a string of insults towards Julius Malema following the EFF leader's recent "Grandpa it's enough" comments.Malema's attack on the nearly-93-year-old Zimbabwean leader on Monday was "irritatingly despicable", said information minister Christopher Mushohwe in a nearly two-page long statement that was read out on state TV's main evening news bulletin.The minister said Malema was seeking to make up for his "inner political deficiencies" by "projecting himself as a trans-border continental politician who fancies himself big and cute enough to pass comment and judgement on developments elsewhere on the continent".Zanu-PF lawmaker Psychology Maziwisa had already called Malema a "little irrelevant man". Malema used to be outspoken in his praise of Mugabe, stoking the ire of Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change.In the statement Mugabe's government also accused the EFF leader of "treacherous, pro-white... politics" - exactly the same kind of words it uses to refer to the MDC.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/loud-mouthed-gucci-revolutionary-mugabe-govt-slates-malema-again-20170125
