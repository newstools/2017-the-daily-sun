ASPIRING amateur tennis player, Gift Radebe, is a man on a mission.Radebe wants to become the first black athlete to represent Team South Africa at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.The 20-year-old youngster from Bobhelong, in Vanderbijlpark, South of Joburg, will not rest until his dream becomes reality.Radebe could have easily chosen the path of becoming a soccer player &ndash; a sporting code that is common in the black community &ndash; but he has a burning passion and will stop at nothing to become a professional tennis player.Radebe, who relies on a support grant for to make ends meet, is doing genetic management at the local town, where he is currently doing an internship programme.He says the sport makes him believe in his ability as a young person.Radebe was introduced to the sport at the age of nine by his coach and he has never looked back ever since.His mother died when he was doing Grade 8 at age 14.He says his dad does not play an active role in his life. Radebe, who has accumulated awards and certificates while he was in primary, secondary schools as well as local competitions, said: &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m inside the tennis court I completely forget about everything that&rsquo;s happening in my life.&ldquo;I want to be the first black African tennis player at the 2020 Olympic Games.&rdquo;Tennis is an expensive sport and Radebe uses Bophelong Stadium as his training base.He gets training equipment from the Bophelong Sports Council, but that is not enough.He hopes the Gauteng Department of Sport and Tennis South Africa will lend a helping hand.He believes a bit of help would shape him into a better player.Radebe had a tough upbringing, but he insists that his background will not determine his future.Radebe told SunSport: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play tennis because I want to become rich, it&rsquo;s because of the passion that I have for the game. &ldquo;I play at the Vaal Tennis Club and other private competitions in other environments where there is a serious lack of competition,&rdquo; he said.Although Radebe is good at amateur level, he still has a long way to go before his Olympic dream is realised.He told SunSport: &ldquo;I need to be registered with Tennis South Africa and play many games. And I can do this.&rdquo;Evan Maripa and Kgothatso &ldquo;KG&rdquo; Montjane, the stars of Wheelchair Tennis South Africa, are his source of inspiration to dream big.Radebe&rsquo;s role model is Andy Murray, who is ranked number one in the world.But because of shortage of money, Radebe is unable to travel to big tournaments all over the country.The promising star is appealing for sponsorship to pay for his tournament fees.
