ZAMBIA coach Wedson Nyirenda has admitted that the attacking department of his team needs some refreshing.Veteran thirty-somethings Collins Mbesuma and Winston Kalengo have over the last two years carried the burden of the weight of expectations in Zambia s attack.Nyirenda told Zambian media that it was a major concern that the seasonal goal turnover from Zambian strikers was very low. We need to start looking at strikers to replace Collins Mbesuma. He is aging, so I am looking at upcoming youngsters like Fashion Sakala, Patson Daka and others, Nyirenda said. It s not acceptable that a season s top scorer with 13 goals receives the Golden Boot, we have to be honest. The 2016 Golden Boot went to DR Congo-born striker Water Bwalya of Nkana, who scored 24 goals, nine more than Zesco United and Kenya forward Jesse Were.On the local front, Daka was the best performer with 12 league goals and one in a cup competition for Power Dynamos to see him finish third on the scorers chart. Felix Nyaende of Forest Rangers was not far behind with 11 goals.Zanaco s Sakala, who added four goals for the champions Zambia at the 2016 Cosafa Under-20 Cup, scored nine league goals.
