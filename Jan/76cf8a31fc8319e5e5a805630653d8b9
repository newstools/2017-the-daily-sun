DESPITE the fact that SuperSport United have denied rumours that head coach Stuart Baxter has been earmarked for the vacant Bafana Bafana hot seat, sources have stated that he remains the front runner.Matsatsantsa a Pitori CEO Stan Matthews and chairman Khulu Sibiya were united in claiming their coach is going nowhere, but Sibaya admitted: &ldquo;Stan told me that Safa is making overtures to Stuart but said to me that Stuart is going nowhere.&ldquo;He had an experience with Bafana before and that was not a good experience, so he will not be keen to go back there. He is happy at SuperSport. That is what Stan told me, as I&rsquo;ve not spoken to Stuart about this.&rdquo;Stormed Matthews: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s absolute rubbish.&rdquo;Baxter is believed to be the ideal replacement for Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba who was fired by Safa last month.When approached Baxter, who coached the national side in 2004-05, and has had great success with Kaizer Chiefs and now SuperSport, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the SuperSport head coach and I&rsquo;m enjoying my job. I cannot make any comment on this. I&rsquo;m not going to fuel any speculation.&rdquo;Safa CEO Dennis Mumble said he had not spoken to SuperSport or Baxter: &ldquo;I have not spoken to any coach. I have not even started working on getting the wheels in motion to get a new coach. We&rsquo;ll start the process next week.&rdquo;The United chairman stated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not releasing him because I&rsquo;m ambitious about winning the league. He is an amazing coach. &ldquo;Stuart is tough and wants to win and, most importantly, the players love and respond to him. He has changed our team for the better. So we&rsquo;re not going to let him go.&rdquo;CONTINUED ON PAGE 26
