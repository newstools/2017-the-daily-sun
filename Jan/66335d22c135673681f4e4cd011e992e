TWO uncles accused of forcing their teenage niece into an arranged marriage were granted bail yesterday.The Mthatha Magistrates Court released the two men and the husband, who is almost twice the girl&rsquo;s age, on bail of R500 each. They are facing charges of abduction and attempted rape.On Saturday the Hawks pounced on the homestead of a 26-year-old man in Mampingeni Village in Baziya and found a 14-year-old girl who was said to be his wife.She had allegedly been taken to the homestead last Monday after being told by one of her uncles that she had to fit her new school uniform.Hawks provincial spokeswoman Captain Anelisa Feni said: &ldquo;When the Hawks arrived at the suspect&rsquo;s family home, the family confirmed the girl was their new makoti.&ldquo;She was taken away by officials.&rdquo; The SunTeam spoke to the uncle of the man accused of marrying the underage girl.The man claimed that the family did not know she was underage.&ldquo;The girl was happy. We honestly did not know she was so young. As rural people, we do not ask the bride&rsquo;s age when we practise ukuthwala,&rdquo; he said.Eastern Cape social development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi described the practice as barbaric and said the girl should be focusing on her education. The case was postponed to 2 March.
