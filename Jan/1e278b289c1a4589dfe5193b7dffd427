When the family later went on to fetch David&rsquo;s belongings, his blanket was missing.&ldquo;Now we can&rsquo;t sleep because we are haunted by David. He is demanding his blanket from the grave.&ldquo;According to our culture, he was supposed to be buried with the blanket. The hospital told us they had taken it to be washed, but they never returned it. &ldquo;David needs his blanket. We won&rsquo;t have any peace until it is returned to him,&rdquo; said the gogo.Gauteng Health spokesman Steve Mabona said they plan to meet with the family soon. &ldquo;We have started an investigation, but the staff member mentioned in the complaint is not on duty.

We will send an SMS to gogo Sonto requesting an urgent meeting with her so this matter can be solved.&rdquo;
