WHEN the academic year started the school was told it might have to close because of the low pupil numbers.But a week later, many more pupils had registered at Mpotla Senior Secondary School at Makgophong in Zebediela, Limpopo.Now they don&rsquo;t have enough books, chairs or teachers!Grade 12 pupil Leshia Baloyi (17) said they don&rsquo;t mind sharing textbooks during class but it&rsquo;s hard to study at home.&ldquo;We will soon write our first term exams and some of the subjects haven&rsquo;t even been started. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to pass at the end of the year. If the department would only pay attention to our problems we would be so happy.&rdquo;Leshia said their tables are still in good condition but they have no chairs. They are sitting on old chair frames without seats.Another pupil, Reneilwe Leopeng (20), said the school had a 100% matric pass rate over the past three years despite the depressing environment.But now that proud record is in danger.&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t raise this matter now it will mean the next generation will suffer the same hardships we do.&rdquo;Local headman Simon Makgatha pleaded with the department to deliver textbooks and employ teachers to prevent pupils&rsquo; studies being further delayed.Limpopo Education spokesman Dr Naledzani Rasila said teachers were allocated to schools according to the number of pupils registered.Regarding textbooks, he said pupils were expected to return their books at the end of last year.&ldquo;If they failed to do so there will be a shortage of books at the school.&rdquo; He said more books would be delivered once the school applied at the end of the month.
