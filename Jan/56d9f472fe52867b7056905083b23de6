THE anxious wait for the matric results is over.Yesterday Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced the 2016 matric results at Vodacom World in Midrand.The matric pass rate for the 2016 is 76,2% but 72,5% if condoned matrics are added.Motshekga said 2016 was the largest class to have registered for matric exams in the last nine years. Contributing to this large number is the progression of failed grade 11 to grade 12.Last year condoned matrics numbered 108 000.Motshekga said these pupils didn&rsquo;t bring the pass rate down as predicted by some critics.&ldquo;The pass rate has instead gone up by 2% from last year&rsquo;s 70,5% with condoned matrics.&ldquo;If condoned pupils are not given a chance they will drop out. By promoting them, we keep them in the system.&ldquo;Of the progressed learners we managed to get over 3 000 bachelor degree passes. More than 12 000 diplomas and more than 13 000 that were condoned and progressed,&rdquo; she said. Motshekga admitted that the foundation phase has to strengthen to prevent the dropout rate.
