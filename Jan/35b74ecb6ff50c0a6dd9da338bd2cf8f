GOGO Anna Mphahlele (60) is struggling to bury her nephew, Kgomotso Mphahlele (41), who died on 3 January at the Sondela dump near Rustenburg, North West. The bereaved family told the People&rsquo;s Paper that Kgomotso was not registered in their funeral plan. He lived his life at the dump with friends, making a living from waste material. They built a plastic shelter there. And because Kgomotso chose the life of a vagrant after his mother died many years ago, he had neither an ID nor a birth certificate. &ldquo;We used to go around looking for him. Whenever we found him he would tell us that he&rsquo;d come home but he never did,&rdquo; said Peter Mphahlele, his cousin.According to his friends he died in his sleep.Now the family is asking for anyone who can assist to please help the family with money for a coffin, and to pay for a gravesite for R1 500. No one in the family is working.Peter said a coffin would cost about R6 000 and there would be other expenses like groceries for mourners. In the meantime, Kgomotso&rsquo;s remains are being kept at a government mortuary in Phokeng.
