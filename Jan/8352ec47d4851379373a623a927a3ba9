A COP was killed when the driver of a Mini Cooper lost control of the car on Sunday morning. The car spun around and landed on Warrant Officer Levy Moyawa. Levy (54), known as Pelo, was sitting on a crate at a vegetable stall on the busy road in Zone 8, Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane. According to stall owner Baba Rakau, the Mini Cooper and a Kia Rio came towards them driving at normal speed. When they neared his stall, the drivers allegedly spun their cars before driving off towards the end of the street. &ldquo;There they met an old man who was riding his bike and they spun around him before driving back. &ldquo;This time, both cars were driving at high speed and the Mini Cooper tried to make a hand brake turn but lost control. It flew in the direction of my stall, hitting it and dragging Levy until it came to a stop. He was sitting on a crate and had no time to duck for his life.&rdquo;Baba said having seen what had happened, the Kia driver just sped off. &ldquo;We called the police and rushed Levy to Legae Private Clinic in Mabopane. This pains me.&rdquo; His wife, Fela Moyawa (49), said she was at church. &ldquo;I got a call telling me my husband had been rushed to hospital. I just don&rsquo;t understand how people can be careless like that.&rdquo; Levy was stationed at Ga-Rankuwa Police Station. Warrant Officer Matthews Nkoadi said a man was bust and police are investigating.&ldquo;The man was allegedly drunk and his friend is still at large.&rdquo;
