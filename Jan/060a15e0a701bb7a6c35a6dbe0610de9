They knocked and a woman opened the door, but the man appeared behind the woman with a gun.&ldquo;He started shooting at us. Luckily nobody was struck in the head,&rdquo; said Lydia.&ldquo;While we were lying on the ground, he told us to say our last prayers. &ldquo;He kept on firing in our direction until the gun was empty. Then the man began hitting us with the gun.&rdquo; The man eventually stopped because the people in the street were screaming at him.The cops arrived and the victims were taken to hospital by ambulance.Lydia&rsquo;s daughter, Polidiah (27), who was discharged on Friday, said their lives are still in danger: &ldquo;That man has still not been arrested,&rdquo; she said.Captain Mega Ndobe from the Ekurhuleni West Cluster said a case has been opened with the Vosloorus police.&ldquo;Investigations are continuing.
