THE PREMIER Soccer League faces major challenges in today&rsquo;s digital age.Soccer lovers are treated to wall-to-wall coverage of PSL matches and the league will have to move forward to meet challenges of falling attendance figures at matches due to fans watching at home and on smart phones.Speaking at the 10th anniversary of the PSL partnership with SuperSport International at the weekend, league chairman Irvin Khoza said clubs and the league would be meeting the new challenges head-on: &ldquo;We have to be better prepared for this new internet revolution. Smart phones are the future.&rdquo;Khoza said Mzansi was unique in that matches were screened live throughout the country, where in England not all the matches are broadcast live.He also said big plans were afoot to increase the MultiChoice Diski Challenge, which is another SuperSport innovation.The MDC is the PSL reserve league and plans are underway to make it a full two rounds of league fixtures instead of the one round as it stands now.Said Khoza: &ldquo;We also want to have a MDC knockout competition. We have to invest in the youth and club academies.&rdquo;The PSL is one of the top 10 richest leagues in the world and richest in Africa. SuperSport ploughed in R2 billion for the rights to televise PSL matches live from a deal signed in 2011 and ending in 2018.Although Khoza was mum on the new deal with the pay channel he said he was happy SuperSport had said it wanted the arrangment to continue for another 10 years.He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic that a corporate giant like SuperSport is backing the PSL.&rdquo;However, when asked if the deal would be increased, Khoza was tight-lipped.The new deal which will kick off in the 2018-19 season will run for another five years and is believed to be worth R800 million per season, which translates to a whopping R4 billion.Khoza said that in future a portion of players&rsquo; signing fees would be kept for them to be used when they retire.
