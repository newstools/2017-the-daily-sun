THE fears of some parents, that their kids would not be allowed back when schools reopened this week, were for nothing. A group of angry parents, whose kids were enrolled at Vuk&rsquo;uzenzele Primary School near Rustenburg, North West, called Daily Sun, claiming they were being forced to pay R100 to readmit or transfer their children.They said when the no-fee school in Freedom Park closed on 7 December they were turned away because they did not have the R100 re-admission fee. Others said they were made to pay R100 for transfer letters. Daily Sun met parents who showed printed forms on which they had to indicate whether their child was coming back or not, but the forms said nothing about R100.Malebo Ntsiane (30), an unemployed parent, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so worried about this fee because I don&rsquo;t have a man who works at the mine. Not all of us can afford to pay that money,&rdquo; said Malebo. But North West Education spokesman Freddy Sepeng said it was not true that parents had been forced to pay R100, either for readmission or transfers. He said the no-fee school&rsquo;s school governing body had earlier said that the money received from government was not enough to pay the staff at the school. &ldquo;We called a meeting and told those who attended that it was a voluntary payment &ndash; only those who could afford it should pay it as a donation to help the school pay the staff,&rdquo; said Sepeng. He appealed to parents who were affected to go back to school so that they can be assisted free of charge.
