LUFUNO Mandevu&rsquo;s grief-stricken family is tired of living in suspense. The body of Lufuno (29), from Khalava, near Thohoyandou was allegedly found in the Tshilavulu mountains, in the Mutale area of Limpopo, two weeks ago.Lufuno, who worked at a garage in Thohoyandou, went missing on 27 December after visiting a faith healer at Bashasha. She was last seen with the prophet. Residents went in search of her in the bush, but pointed fingers at the prophet, who was on the run by then.The prophet was arrested in Musina while waiting to be deported as an illegal immigrant. He was charged with murder and pointed out to cops where he had buried what he said was Lufuno&rsquo;s body. For the past two weeks, the family has been waiting for DNA results to see if indeed it was Lufuno&rsquo;s body. It has meant they cannot have a funeral.Last Monday, prophet Richard Mlambo appeared before the Tshilamba Magistrates Court. His case was postponed to 3 March. He is being held in custody.Lefuno&rsquo;s brother, Khathu Mandevu, said they were relieved when his sister&rsquo;s body was found. &ldquo;We hoped it would bring closure to the trauma we are facing. But it&rsquo;s been two weeks now since my sister&rsquo;s body has been lying in the mortuary. &ldquo;Our hands are tied by technical hitches and we cannot bury her as she has not yet been identified. Our lives have come to a complete halt. I am on unpaid leave to prepare her for a decent send-off.&ldquo;My brothers have also been frustrated because we thought she would be buried at the weekend.&rdquo; Khathu said they hope they can bury her at the weekend.
