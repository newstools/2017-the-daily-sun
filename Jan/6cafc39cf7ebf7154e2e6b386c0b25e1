ANC chairwoman and Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete is ready to succeed Jacob Zuma as president of the ANC. In interviews with leading weekend newspapers, Mbete said she had been approached by many party structures and had decided to make herself available. She told the Sunday Times although she was surprised by the timing of the ANC Women&rsquo;s League&rsquo;s decision to back Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, nothing was preventing her from running for the party&rsquo;s top job.&ldquo;All it does is clarify the views of the leadership of the Women&rsquo;s League,&rdquo; she said.She said the league didn&rsquo;t say nobody else should be nominated. Mbete first hinted at her leadership ambitions during a Hlubi traditional ceremony last year, where she said she had been asked by several senior leaders to lead the party. At the time, she said she was waiting for the right time. She could end up splitting the Women&rsquo;s League as she has support within the league, despite it having come out in support of Dlamini-Zuma.In an interview with City Press, Mbete dismissed rumours that she was in poor health. She said she was just extremely tired after a hectic election campaign last year. The 67-year-old said she didn&rsquo;t have health issues and the rumours were started when it became clear she was going to raise her hand to replace Zuma. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as fit as a fiddle.&ldquo;Those of you who want to harp on about issues of health, I think we can take tests with people of my age and even those older or younger, and you will find I am quite healthy.&rdquo;
