ZIMBABWE captain, Willard Katsande, has expressed disappointment and anger at their overall showing at the Africa Cup of Nations currently underway in four provinces of Gabon, a tiny oil-rich western African country. He conceded to the fact their performance was &ldquo;not good at all&rdquo; where they opened the competition with a 2-2 draw against Algeria, a match they were supposed to win, but were let down by poor finishing and lack of solid defending.On Thursday, they lost 2-0 to a venomous Senegal side where they were hit with two quick goals in the opening 20 minutes to put their quarterfinal qualification hopes into disarray.They will play Tunisia tomorrow night (9pm) to close Group B fixtures while table toppers &ndash; with six points (after two wins), Senegal &ndash; will play Algeria at the same time.Explains the Kaizer Chiefs star: &ldquo;Our biggest mistake was still the same. I agree performance was not good at all. We need to learn to defend better and avoid conceding early goals at critical phases of the game.&rdquo;He admitted that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;very critical when you are playing in tournaments such as the Africa Cup of Nations to defend well&rdquo;.&ldquo;You need to guard your goals jealously,&rsquo; added the 31-year-old Mutoko-born defender who has been linked with a move to SuperSport United.&ldquo;In the past two games (Algeria and Senegal), if you could recall, you will realise we conceded the first goal under 15 minutes.&rdquo;Against Algeria they allowed Mahrez&rsquo;s opening goal (of the two) in the 12th minute while against Senegal Sadio Mane hit them first nine minutes into the game.&ldquo;This is not good enough in terms of playing in such tournaments,&rdquo; said Katsande, as he gears up for the battle of their lives tomorrow.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll work on defending properly and try to get to at least 45, 50 or even 60th minutes without conceding. With the quality of players we have, I think we&rsquo;re going to win matches, especially the last group match against Tunisia.&rdquo;He added that lessons learned from the two matches are: &ldquo;When you play against top professional teams, players who come from big leagues, you need to focus on the game, with or without the ball.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s key, especially against a tactical team like Senegal.&rdquo;He said they will use their experience too but &ldquo;unfortunately we&rsquo;ve learned in a bad way&rdquo;.
