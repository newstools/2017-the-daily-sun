I T S time to separate the men from the boys at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.Formalities are now over as the tournament is starting to take shape.It s survival of the fittest in a dog-eat-dog world.The cream of African football have gathered in the West African country to battle it out for the highest accolade on the continent.The 16 contenders who have graced the Gabonese shores have one goal in common and that s to be crowned the best team in the motherland.While all eyes are on holders Ivory Coast to see if they can successfully defend their title, only a few players remain from their golden generation that added the second continental title.Can Ivorians do it without their magician, Yaya Toure, who retired from international football?Stay glued to your TV sets to find out the answer.The Black Panthers, who are this year s host nation, have had a shaky start to the competition, with two unexpected draws, but they re still alive and still regarded as the dark horses by virtue of being the host nation.According to statistics, only eight countries have won the tournament as hosts.These countries include Ethiopia, Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, South Africa and Tunisia.The Black Panthers are the third country to host the Nations Cup by default, following the withdrawal of countries that were intended to host the biannual showpiece.In 2013, South Africa came to Caf s rescue after Libya were not ready to host the showpiece on time.Equatorial Guinea also stepped in as the last-minute host after North African giants Morocco pulled out due to the outbreak of the Ebola pandemic on the continent.But action on the field of play has not lived up to action in the opening stages of the competition.We have seen too many draws as teams have adopted a cautious approach.It has been a slow start indeed. But hopefully, things will improve as the tournament heats up.Cameroon s Indomitable Lions are almost unrecognisable as they have a new team with unknown players. Their intention is to build and gain experience as the next hosts in 2019.Without a doubt Group C is the toughest with three former champions.The DRC, Ivory Coast, Morocco and the Togo make this the group of death.Till next week hawuuuweng banna!
