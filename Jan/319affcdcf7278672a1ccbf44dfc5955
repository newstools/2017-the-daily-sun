VETERAN left-back Tsepo Masilela and Kaizer Chiefs could part ways if the management dillydallies in renewing his contract.The one-year option on his contract was exercised in 2015 and it expires at the end of season. He could follow Tefu Mashamaite, Reyaad Pieterse, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Mandla Masango, who all exited Naturena under a cloud due to contract deadlock.The 31-year-old has been struggling to break into coach Steve Komphela’s starting lineup since the arrival of Sibusiso Khumalo from SuperSport United before the start of the season. Khumalo has commanded a regular place in the team, which means Masilela has seen little action. Masilela’s agent Mike Makaab told SunSport that regular game-time would be a priority in their contract negotiations with Chiefs management. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_Mjp5oqyYGlHzzTPNn3SNpPeztznR2NKA9JL1QuHaABnc1TD1t27_VmmjCS81S4i5kk-Ju6vIORRwGzELZ5r3upzOwgPHJZt_gMHwazGcZMPeXIjNgipVh4Lzt5pfJYjkYSN4Rxw4AqWmdcyhzH1XKOoH8NsKiiwMDBvIfOwsrA9KWdxAWLaItz-mxmc3ntVPKveznMHt7F4THo85aoqZ59_yunPzYlaDZE04b_Bm_jb6zX7jfhTj_ewYxuh_U80tm2dzVu21F4qh-8YMylhLQA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPcN4tacgkwcEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The most important thing is for him to get more game-time. Masilela is not young any more and wants to play. He has only had a few games so far, which is not good at this stage of his career.”Meanwhile, Makaab revealed that all is not lost for defender Lorenzo Gordinho, who has not secured a deal with Danish club Aalborg BK. “His trial went well but they won’t be signing him this season. They said he had to work on some aspects of his game. They feel he is not yet ready to play in Europe at this stage, but will continue to monitor his progress,” Makaab said.The 22-year-old’s return has opened the door for Chiefs management to renew his current deal, which expires in June.“We hope to finalise his deal with Chiefs before the end of the week” Makaab added.
