JUST a day after Daily Sun published the story of the pepper spray rapist, cops have bust the man who has allegedly been raping and robbing women.The 32-year-old is behind bars, facing more than eight rape and theft cases after residents read the People&rsquo;s Paper story and told cops about a suspicious person in the area. Captain Manyaza Ralidzhivha confirmed the alleged pepper spray suspect is behind bars.Family violence and child protection and sexual offences unit members went to Tembisa, Alexandra and Kempton Park.Ralidzhivha said cops saw a man and woman walking in an open space where these cases were committed. &ldquo;Officers stopped and asked whether the woman knew the man she was walking with,&rdquo; said Ralidzhivha.&ldquo;The woman told police she didn&rsquo;t know the man and she was with him because he had promised her a job. She said he phoned her to meet him so he could take her for placement.&rdquo;The police arrested the man and detained him at Ivory Park police cells. He will soon be appearing before a magistrate. The cops said many young women have fallen victim to a man who claims he wants to help them. &ldquo;He befriends them and tells them about the jobs he can arrange for them. &ldquo;He pretends to phone a company and tells them he can bring the woman to them immediately,&rdquo; said Ralidzhivha.
