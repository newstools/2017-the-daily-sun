ONCE again social media are in an uproar after angry anti-death posers created their own pose: first it was the &ldquo;death pose&rdquo;, now the &ldquo;prayer pose&rdquo;.Daily Sun reported about the death pose yesterday, but not everyone was happy about the strange practice.Now prayer posers are posting pictures of themselves holding Bibles, kneeling down as if in prayer or opening their arms to Heaven.They even said those who were doing the death pose were asking for trouble or were even possessed by demons. On Facebook, Gomotsegang Ledwaba wrote: &ldquo;Death pose for what, for who? This is a demon. We need all night prayer.&rdquo;Pro&ccedil;ash K&auml;desh posted on Facebook, saying that people are calling for death rather than life. &ldquo;People are calling for early graves and I don&rsquo;t see any fun. Dead Pose e ya bone. It&rsquo;s Satanic!&rdquo; read his post.But other religious groups are also not happy about the prayer pose.Bishop Sandile Nxumalo of the Beauty Of Christ Ministries of South Africa says connecting with the Almighty is not something that people should play with.&ldquo;People kneel down for many reasons. People kneel to ask for forgiveness, to give thanks, to ask for healing. Some kneel to ask for help, but it is never a joke,&rdquo; said the bishop. &ldquo;So what are these youngsters asking for? This is asking for trouble, because the Almighty could punish them at any time!&rdquo;
