THE evil work of izinyoka threatens to kill children every day in this kasi.&ldquo;Stop this before it kills us,&rdquo; is the desperate plea from worried mkhulu Zachariah Ngundana (54) of Zwide, Port Elizabeth.He said recently an 18-month-old child was shocked to death in Chris Hani squatter camp.&ldquo;This made me realise that the same could happen to my family and neighbours. &ldquo;Izinyoka are killing people, but bad workmanship by municipal workers also leaves electricity cables exposed. &ldquo;The workers did not dig the trenches on our pavements deep enough. Now the soil has eroded and the deadly power cables are lying open for anyone to step on.&ldquo;These exposed cables are also at the substation in front of my house. I&rsquo;ve tried to cover them with soil but it does not help.&ldquo;When it rains, the cables make violent sparks,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.He said municipal officials promised to fix the problem but the promise was just empty words.&ldquo;This has been going on since 2011. I have reported it to the municipality several times.&rdquo;He worries about the safety of his grandkids, aged six and 12. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said he would inform the engineering department. &ldquo;They will visit the area to fix the problem,&rdquo; said Mniki.
