A WOMAN who has taken the ANC to court is living in fear of her life.Sihle Bolani&rsquo;s urgent application was dismissed with costs yesterday. She is claiming R2,2 million from the ANC.Shortly after the court hearing in the South Gauteng High Court, Sihle got a phone call from what sounded like a hitman.In a telephone conversation recorded by Sihle and supplied to Daily Sun, the alleged hitman tells her: &ldquo;There are people you are fighting with who have come to us.&rdquo;The man, whose name is known to Daily Sun, says: &ldquo;They want to take you out because they might lose a lot.&rdquo;The man says the same people hired them previously and had not paid them so they wanted to get back at them.He suggested meeting in a place like a casino where guns were not allowed. Sihle raised concerns about him carrying out the hit. The man says his partners didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing.&ldquo;If you are scared to meet me, I will have to step back and let the plan go ahead,&rdquo; he said.Sihle then ends the six-minute conversation.She has opened a case of intimidation. In court, public relations expert Sihle said her company was hired to provide services during last year&rsquo;s municipal elections for which she had not yet been paid. She detailed how a war room was set up to disempower DA and EFF campaigns through tactics that would not show the participation of the ANC. Many top entertainers did campaign for the ANC during the election, but said that they did so in a personal capacity.DJ Tira told Daily Sun he was not paid to take part. &ldquo;It was for the love of the party.&rdquo; Dr Malinga said he wished he had been paid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an artist, not a politician.&rdquo; Khanyi Mbau said: &ldquo;People were paid? Well, I&rsquo;m clearly missing out if they were!&rdquo;
