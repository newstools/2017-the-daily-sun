FIKILE Mtshwene claims that refusing to pay a bribe for her electricity meter led to her electricity being disconnected. Not happy with the act by the Eskom employees, Fikile Mtshweni from Daveyton in Ekurhuleni said she confronted the officials &ndash; which ended in a physical fight. According to Fikile, two Eskom technicians told her that someone had reported that her meter was giving her problems.&ldquo;I asked them who had called because our meter was functioning well. They refused to tell me and insisted on checking the meter.&ldquo;They then came back and told me that my meter had been bridged. They demanded R250 not to disconnect it. I refused because I knew that my meter was not bridged.&rdquo; She claimed the men then went ahead and removed the meter from the wall.&ldquo;I confronted them and tried to stop them from removing it. One of the technicians then pushed me away and took a sharp object and scratched me with it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take this lying down. There is no way I can run a tavern with a faulty meter.&rdquo; Fikile claimed that on their way out, the Eskom officials kicked her petrol generator, damaging it in the process.Cases of assault and malicious damage to property were opened at the Daveyton Police Station.Eskom said it was not aware of the allegations and would investigate.
