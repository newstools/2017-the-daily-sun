THREE NEIGHBOURS are scared and confused. Their names appear on a Whats-App hit list, allegedly put together by a thwasa who will soon be a sangoma. THEY ALL ASK THE SAME QUESTION: WHY DOES SHE WANT US TO DIE?Fundephi Ntuli (37), Amos Monaketse (75) and Koti Phakela (86), have nothing in common except that they are all neighbours who live in Meadowlands zone 5, Soweto. Fundephi told Daily Sun the thwasa&rsquo;s sister was always visiting them. &ldquo;On Thursday she visited us again,&rdquo; said Fundephi. &ldquo;She was talking to her sister on Whats- App but I didn&rsquo;t know what they were talking about.&rdquo; But then the young woman put her phone down on the table and left the room. &ldquo;Something inside me pushed me to check her phone,&rdquo; said Fundephi. &ldquo;I nearly fainted to see my name on her sister&rsquo;s hit list.&rdquo; The messages said when the thwasa completed her training, she was coming back to murder the three neighbours. Without the thwasa&rsquo;s sister realisinging, Fundephi forwarded the conversations to her own phone. &ldquo;I was filled with fear and anger. &ldquo;I showed the messages to my neighbours who were also mentioned in the messages. They got the shock of their lives,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why she is targeting me. The only time I had an argument with the thwasa was when I lent her money and she didn&rsquo;t pay me back for a long time.&rdquo; She said the thwasa&rsquo;s sister was like family and was always visiting the house. &ldquo;But she was a spy who was gathering information to feed her sister.&rdquo; Amos, whose name also appears in the message, said he has never had an argument with the young woman. &ldquo;That young woman must come back from wherever she is training and explain why I am on her hit list. &ldquo;I will open a case at the police station if she doesn&rsquo;t explain what she meant by those messages.&rdquo; Gogo Koti said; &ldquo;I was also shocked. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve done to this person.&rdquo; Daily Sun spoke to the thwasa&rsquo;s sister, who said she knows about the text messages from her sister, but she said Fundephi had no right to look at her messages. &ldquo;I was talking to my sister and I don&rsquo;t expect anyone to search my phone. &ldquo;People who search my phone must just keep quiet.&rdquo; Daily Sun tried to call the thwasa, who is at an unknown place for training, but her phone was not answered on Sunday or Monday.
