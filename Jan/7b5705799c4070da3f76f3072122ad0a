But when I arrived at the shops where we were to meet, I found him with another woman. I left him with our daughter and went home.”Nobuhle said her husband’s car broke down and that he left his nyatsi and child with the car at a mall in Honeydew. When he later returned to the car, the nyatsi had allegedly taken his wheels and disappeared. Captain Xoli Mbele, Joburg Central police spokesman, said detectives arrested the woman (23) on a charge of child theft. “The father reported the child missing on 21 December.“Investigations led cops to KZN and the investigating officers took the child’s mother along with them as she knew the suspect. “The suspect was pointed out. She took police to Eshowe where the child was recovered.” Mbele said the suspect would appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court soon.
