IT was time for Thandiwe Ndlovu&rsquo;s 11-month-old son Jana to sleep, but the little one started acting strangely, clinging to her tightly and crying so loudly that she had to walk out of the shack with him.A few minutes later Thandiwe understood why. When she returned to her shack, she found it being eaten by flames!Nobody knows how the fire started, but nine shacks in Zandspruit squatter camp, near Honeydew on the West Rand, including hers, were razed to the ground by the fire over the weekend.Thandiwe said she thanked her baby son for saving them.&ldquo;My son could have burned to death because I was trying to put him to sleep while I sat outside with my neighbours.&rdquo;People in other shacks also managed to run to safety and no one was injured.Thandiwe said she lost furniture that she had bought in December with her bonus, as well as extra cash that she received from her boss, as she had been retrenched.&ldquo;I now have no job and I lost everything, but I am grateful that our lives were saved. &ldquo;It is difficult to accept that my son and I are left with only the clothes that we are wearing. But we are happy that we were not harmed.&rdquo;In another part of the squatter camp, a further nine shacks burned to the ground. Residents suspect the fire was caused by izinyoka.Gauteng social development MEC Nandi Mayethula-Khoza visited the squatter camp to hand out blankets and food parcels to the affected families.
