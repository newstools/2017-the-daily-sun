A MAN suspected by his community of being a rapist was arrested on Saturday. This came after a 12-year-old girl in Zonke Izizwe, Ekurhuleni told her family the suspect raped her in June. The girl&rsquo;s mum yesterday told the SunTeam the man was known for raping little boys. She was shocked when she learned her daughter had become a victim of his evil ways. &ldquo;At first she didn&rsquo;t want to talk because she had been threatened. But on Saturday she eventually spoke out,&rdquo; said the mum. The 30-year-old mum cried uncontrollably as she told the SunTeam she didn&rsquo;t understand how her daughter ended up in the man&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;She told me her gogo had sent her to the man&rsquo;s yard to feed the chickens. &ldquo;My daughter said the suspect first asked her if she was a virgin before forcing himself on her at gunpoint.&rdquo;The suspect allegedly told the child he would shoot her if she ever told anyone what had happened. According to the girl, the suspect told her she must point out a random house if her parents found out she had been raped. Police spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe said a case rape was opened and the suspect was arrested. He will appear in court soon.
