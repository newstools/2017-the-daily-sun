ANGRY residents of the Freedom Square squatter camp in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni marched on Wednesday. Their grievances ranged from being overlooked when RDPs were allocated, to portable toilets they were given to replace the ones they had been using.They marched to the Civic Centre in Rabasotho and handed a memorandum to the municipal manager. Resident Lebogang Ntshwanti (39) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;There is no service delivery for us. We are still waiting for houses that were promised to us five years back. Instead, outsiders got preferential treatment.&rdquo;As for the portable toilets, Jack Mokele (47) said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want them. The council should take them back where they came from. These toilets are dirty. They stink and are not good for our health. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t even flush and the kak just piles up. And this causes infections and makes us sick. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want these toilets and will continue protesting until the council gives us the toilets we want.&rdquo; Residents said the yellow-and-orange toilets they had been using for some time were replaced by another brand.Municipal spokesman Themba Radebe said: &ldquo;We need to thoroughly read the people&rsquo;s memorandum and then discuss the matter internally before we can respond to the issues they mentioned. &ldquo;It is our primary goal to resolve concerns raised by residents. We have organised a meeting with community leaders so that we can talk to them.&ldquo;We will also meet residents to talk about how we can find solutions to their complaints.&rdquo;
