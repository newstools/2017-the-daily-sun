WHEN the roof of his RDP house was torn apart by strong wind and heavy rain in 2013, life turned into a nightmare for disabled Samuel Nthane and his two kids.The 69-year-old from Mshongo Village in Zebediela, Limpopo, thought his house would be fixed quickly when disaster management officials gave him a shack as temporary shelter.Three years later, they still live in the shack and now it threatens to kill them!Samuel said the shack leaks whenever it rains and when thunderstorms wreak havoc in the area, it feels as if it is ready to collapse and bury them alive.Samuel&rsquo;s wife died in 2007 and he has since been raising his kids alone with his grant money.Capricorn Municipality spokesman Moffat Senyatsi said they had done their part by providing a temporary shelter.&ldquo;Other stakeholders handed over food parcels and blankets. The department of human settlements is responsible for rebuilding of the house,&rdquo; he said. Human settlements spokesman Khathu Razwiedani told Daily Sun they were aware of the matter and were following it up.
