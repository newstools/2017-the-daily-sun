BACK in 2008, when this year&rsquo;s matrics were in grade 2, they numbered 1 094 373.But by the time they wrote matric at the end of 2016, that number had been slashed to just 668 612. That means a shocking 425 761 had fallen by the wayside!Education experts blame poor primary foundation education, resulting in a high drop-out rate in later grades.Equal Education said the department of education should invest more in early childhood development to help close the gap between kids from affluent and impoverished households.&ldquo;There is persistent overinvestment in grade 12, when the largest investment is needed in the early school grades,&rdquo; Equal Education said in a media statement.&ldquo;Schooling doesn&rsquo;t start at matric. At her press conference today Minister Angie Motshekga will focus only on the percentage of matrics who have written the National Senior Certificate exam. She fails to account for pupils who never made it to matric.&rdquo;Equal Education said children acquire learning deficits in the early grades. &ldquo;Schools which historically served black pupils have remained dysfunctional and unable to teach them how to read, write and calculate at the appropriate level. By grade 3, kids in the poorest 60% of schools are already three years worth of learning behind pupils of more affluent circumstances.&rdquo;But education Professor Elizabeth Walton from Wits University said there could be other reasons why not all pupils reached matric, such as having left the general schooling system to go to TVET colleges.&ldquo;Others could have been removed by their parents from township schools to private ones. Of course others may be completely lost to the system, but it is not all of them.&rdquo;
