THE act of a Good Samaritan led to his death . . .On New Year&rsquo;s Day, Isaac Motha (31) of Cullinan in Tshwane was driving with a friend when he saw a police officer&rsquo;s state vehicle stuck on the side of the road. He asked his friend to stop so that they could help push.According to his brother, Oupa Motha (34), while Isaac was pushing the police vehicle, one of the cops searched the car his friend was driving and found a firearm inside. When questioned, Isaac said it belonged to his boss, who was on holiday, but he was arrested.Today, Isaac&rsquo;s body lies in the mortuary and his family want answers. They were told that he hanged himself in the police cell but nobody officially reported the matter to the family.Oupa said he learned of his brother&rsquo;s death while working at a filling station.&ldquo;I went home to tell my family but they could not believe it because they expect the police to report these matters to them first.&ldquo;My brother was a happy man who worked as a horse trainer. He was not suicidal,&rdquo; Oupa said. Cullinan police spokeswoman, Constable Connie Moganedi, said: &ldquo;We have a formal way of informing families if their relatives die in custody.&rdquo;She said an inquest docket has been opened and investigations were ongoing.
