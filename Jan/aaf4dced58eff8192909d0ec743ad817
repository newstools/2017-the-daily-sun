THEY were regarded as the dark horses of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.They were also called names when refusing to board a plane to Franceville, Gabon where they are based for the duration of the group matches of this African tournament.This was following their fight with the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) over bonus money that was ultimately resolved amicably, according association president Phillip Chayangwa.But now Zimbabwe&rsquo;s 2-2 draw against Algeria at the Stade de Franceville, is a glimpse of what to expect in their second Group B match against Senegal at the same venue on Thursday. The Warriors led this tie for the better part of the match only conceding an equaliser in the 80th minute from Islam Slimani striker. This was a minute after substitute Cuthbert Malajila foiled a golden opportunity for Zim to stretch their lead beyond reach. Zimbabwe went into this match with high expectations with almost half of the players in the starting line up plying their trade in South Africa&rsquo;s PSL.Both sides showed character from the word go with Algeria being first to hit the back of the net minutes into the game via Riyad Mehrez who plays for Leicester City in England.Mehrez&rsquo;s 13th minute goal could have been prevented had the Warriors defence denied him any space to shoot.But Calisto Pasuwa&rsquo;s charges never gave up hope as Golden Arrows&rsquo; Kudwakashe Mahachi reacted quickly to cut short Algeria&rsquo;s celebrations five minutes later. The whole Southern African region celebrated when Nyasha Mushekwi converted from the spot kick 10 minutes before the break to give Zim a 2-1 , but Slimani&rsquo;s 80th minute goal was something Pasuwa never wanted and his delay to make substitutions was his low point. Not even Khama Billiat&rsquo;s individual brilliance could help them as Adi-Rais Cobos Mbolhi thwarted most of his efforts. The Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder was like a mosquito carrying malaria for the Algerians, as he always found space where they thought they have covered.This draw must surely put Belgian Georges Leekens, Algeria coach, under immense pressure after he told whoever cared to listen that he would win this year&rsquo;s Afcon.Zimbabwe will on Thursday face Senegal at the same venue while Algeria have Tunisia in what promises to be an exciting clash.Mathews Mpete is in Gabon courtesy of SuperSport.
