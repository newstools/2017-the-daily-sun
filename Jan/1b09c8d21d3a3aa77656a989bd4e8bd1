NEVER give up on life, is the advice from gogo Joyce Nkosi (73). Gogo Joyce, who lost her eyes in a brutal attack five years ago, said life without her eyes was very hard at first but she has learnt to cope.&ldquo;I see through my heart and my angels always protect me. They guide my steps so I don&rsquo;t fall as I walk.&rdquo;She believes her body parts were taken for muthi. She was walking home one night when two men grabbed her and gouged out her eyes with a knife. She was left on the ground, bleeding and in unbearable pain.She was found the following morning and taken to hospital.&ldquo;I was transferred to St John&rsquo;s Eye Hospital in Soweto but there was nothing the doctors could do.&ldquo;I was angry because my life had come to standstill. I had to rely on other people to help me. I asked God why He had abandoned me.&rdquo;But gogo said she has learnt to deal with the situation.She was living alone in her house but recently one of the neighbours took her in.&ldquo;I can take care of most things around the house but I need help with some of them. People help me with my shopping and washing because I can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;She said people whose life circumstances change suddenly shouldn&rsquo;t give up.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always help somewhere because God will always send angels to look after you.&rdquo;Gogo Joyce has no family and neighbours are appealing to the public to help trace her relatives.&ldquo;We fear something will happen to her,&rdquo; said Nelson Mogudi, a neighbour.&ldquo;She last visited her son, Makhosonke Ndlovu, who might be in Edendale, Pietermaritzburg, KZN.&rdquo;Anyone who has information can contact Nelson Mogudi on 073 465 9728 or Phillip Maphumulo on 071 5249 276.
