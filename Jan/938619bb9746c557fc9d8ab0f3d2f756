A BITTER battle raged for the whole of Wednesday in Fleurhof, Joburg after 1 000 construction workers downed tools.The workers demanded an increase and were allegedly promised they would get it in the new year. But instead, they were met by the Red Ants.When they were blocked from entering the work area on Wednesday chaos erupted.The workers downed tools on Monday, demanding pay rises from Calgro M3 Development.Most of the workers have been working on the Fleurhof project since 2012.One of the protesting workers, Khethaukuthula Ndlovu (30), claimedthe company had promised them an increase at the start of 2017, but apparently had changed its tune.&ldquo;We agreed to an increase in our wages starting 1 January, but that has not happened.&ldquo;When we reminded them about it, they sent the Red Ants on us as if we are thieves. &ldquo;We want to work, but not under such conditions and for so little money,&rdquo; said Khethaukuthula.Calgro M3 executive director Wayne Williams said the strike was illegal but that they would engage in talks with sub-contractors. &ldquo;We hire subcontractors who later hire their own employees.&ldquo;We are trying our best to resolve it in a fair way. What the workers are asking for is impossible.&rdquo; He said they want an increase between 30% and 100%.&ldquo;We will meet them today and try to resolve the matter,&rdquo; said Wayne.
