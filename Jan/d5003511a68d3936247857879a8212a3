Kaizer Chiefs have a number of foreign players currently on trial at the club but will be limited to signing just two as per the limit on foreign nationals in the Premier Soccer League. Gustavo Paez, Pedro Henrique Dias DeAmorimas, Miracle Gabeya and Ismael Olivier Toure are all trying to secure a contract with Amakhosi after arriving on trial this week. The Glamour Boys confirmed that Paez, 26, from Italy and defender Pedro, 24, from Brazil as well as Malawi's Miracle Gabeya, 20, and Ivory Coast's Ismael Olivier Toure, 19, are all vying for a place in the Chiefs' squad.However, even if all four players managed to show coach Steve Komphela they are deserving of a deal at Chiefs, only two would be able to be registered for this campaign due to the fact that they are foreigners.Amakhosi already have Edmore Chirambadare, Lewis Macha and Michelle Katsvairo registered for 2016/17 and Camaldine Abraw on their books, although he hasn't been registered as of yet due to injury. &nbsp; As things stand at this point in time, Chiefs would have to pick two of the players to bring in now if they proved their worth, unless the club are planning ahead for 2017/18. &nbsp; The four foreign nationals arrived on trial during the current January transfer window which opened on 3 January and will close on 31 January meaning there is still time for the club to fill their foreign quota.
