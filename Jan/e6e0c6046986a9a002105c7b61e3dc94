THE promise of fresh mangoes ripe for the picking was too good for Bongaliphi Zondo (12) to resist.The quickest way he and his friend (14) could reach the fruit was to cross the Mvoti River.But Bongaliphi never got to taste the sweet fruit &ndash; he slipped, fell into the river and drowned.The tragedy happened near Ntshawini in KwaDukuza, KZN on Sunday morning while Bongaliphi&rsquo;s parents were at church.The grieving family said they didn&rsquo;t know where they would get money to bury their son.Bongaliphi&rsquo;s father, Vusimuzi Buthelezi (42), said they only learnt about the incident when they got home from church. &ldquo;The boy who took him to go and get mangoes came to report that my son had drowned. We rushed to the scene but when we arrived there he was already dead.&rdquo; said Vusimuzi. He told the People&rsquo;s Paper that the friend told them they wanted to pick mangoes growing across the river. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe that my son is gone. He never went to pick mangoes before. I just started working this month and we don&rsquo;t have the money to bury him,&rdquo; said Vusimuzi.Paul Herbst, spokesman for IPSS Medical Rescue, said: &ldquo;The victim&rsquo;s body was recovered at a depth of seven metres and handed over to the local cops.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident.
