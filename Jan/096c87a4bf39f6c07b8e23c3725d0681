DESPITE having five hopeful players training with his side, Highlands Park coach Gordon Igesund seems in no hurry to beef up his squad!Igesund is still weighing up his options on which players to add to his team. A Zimbabwean midfielder, Gerald Takwara, and four Europeans are hoping to land contracts at the PSL newbies. Igesund refused to mention the names of the European trialists to SunSport. The former Bafana Bafana and SuperSport United mentor insisted that he was looking at signing players with mental strength as the PSL rookies are in the battle to survive relegation.Igesund also confirmed that Takwara was part of his team that travelled to Cape Town yesterday, but would only give a verdict after he saw him play in the four matches during their stay in the Mother City.Igesund said: &ldquo;We will be looking to bring in a few players as we fight to get out of the relegation zone. Takwara is training with us but we haven&rsquo;t yet made any decisions about him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to see how he conducts himself in Cape Town.&rdquo;Having conceded more goals than any PSL team this season, Igesund also stressed the importance of getting defenders that would be able to do the job when the PSL resumes next month. Highlands managed to score 18 goals from 15 matches in the league but conceded 29 in the process. He said: &ldquo;As much as we&rsquo;re still looking at the players, we are surely looking at signing defenders because that is where I feel we need to boost our squad. We have four European players training with us. I cannot reveal names but will soon know who&rsquo;ll be joining us.&rdquo;The Lions of the North will be looking to turn things around from their slow start, having only managed to get two wins from 15 matches. Igesund&rsquo;s charges sit second from bottom of the Absa Premiership table with 13 points and face Telkom Knockout champions Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on 7 February.
