FOR his entire matric year, Bezleel Tsebe (17) would go to sleep at 6pm so his mum and sisters could watch TV. Then he would get up in the middle of the night to study. And his commitment has paid off!The Kgakoa Secondary School pupil from Leokama Village in Moletjie, Limpopo has scored five distinctions in his six subjects of maths, English, geography, life sciences and life orientation. Bazleel said &ldquo;I had a study plan. I slept when they watched TV and got up to study after they&rsquo;d gone to bed.&rdquo; Bazleel will be studying mechanical engineering at the University of Joburg. He has received bursaries from two private companies and he has to decide which he will accept. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work hard to make my dad and my mother&rsquo;s life a lot easier, &rdquo; he said.
