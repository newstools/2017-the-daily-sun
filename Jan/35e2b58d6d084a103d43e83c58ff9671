SPAR Proteas captain Bongiwe Msomi is adamant that they will not stand back for the top three sides in the world in the Sanzea Quad Series starting in Mzansi tomorrow. South Africa start their campaign with a clash with England. The two teams drew their match in the last edition of the tournament in Australasia and the Proteas will hope to do better than they did last September. World champions Australia face their arch-rivals New Zealand, in the first match of the netball competition at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre in Durban tomorrow (3pm).Msomi believes consistency will be key in their campaign. She said that although they had improved, they were not overdoing it and rushing to get up to the same standard as the top teams yet. Said Msomi: &ldquo;We are looking forward to the series &ndash; not to try to live up to what people expect of us but to improve our game. We have been doing that well, we have to keep our consistency going. We are looking forward to doing better as a team. It is always crucial to do our best.&rdquo;Roses captain Ama Agbeze said South Africa&rsquo;s stature had grown in the sport over the past few years. She said the Proteas took them by surprise in the last edition of the tournament when they played to a draw.Said Agbeze: &ldquo;They have developed over the years. I remember they once came second in the World Championship but then faded. Now there has been a resurgence. &ldquo;Netball South Africa (NSA) has invested a lot in the players and programmes. Norma (Plummer) coming on board has really helped them. People have to take NSA seriously, they mean business!&rdquo;She added that constant competition would help both sides compete with teams like the Diamonds and Silver Ferns. Proteas coach Plummer also emphasised the importance of regular competition.&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t get challenged, they don&rsquo;t improve. The losing margin has been growing smaller, our challenge is to keep doing that.&rdquo;
