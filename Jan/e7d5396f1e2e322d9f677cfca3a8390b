SOME residents of Butterworth, Eastern Cape are experiencing water shortages while their neighbours taps flow freely.Nolwandle Jafta (62) from extension 6, Butterworth said she has been without water since last Monday. Desperation forced her to pay R800 to a man who sells water from his truck. &ldquo;The water I bought did not last long,&rdquo; she said.Nolwandle told Daily Sun the municipality used to cut their water supply for days. &ldquo;But now the water supply is cut for even longer periods of time.&ldquo;The municipality has still not offered an explanation. &ldquo;It is very difficult to survive without water. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve called the municipality on several occasions, but they just keep promising to bring water. &ldquo;People from other areas have water. &ldquo;I do not understand why our taps are dry. &ldquo;If the water shortages are a result of the drought, why haven&rsquo;t other areas been affected? &ldquo;This is not fair, especially since we pay the municipality for water.&rdquo; Nolwandle added that the residents are sometimes forced to relieve themselves in the bushes when there is no water.Hleliwe Mente (51), Nolwandle&rsquo;s domestic worker, said water flows freely from the taps in her kasi. &ldquo;I live in Eugene squatter camp. &ldquo;Although it sometimes drips slowly out of the taps, we always have water,&rdquo; she said.Siyabulela Makunga, spokesman for Amathole Municipality, said persistent drought conditions had caused dams and boreholes to dry up. &ldquo;In addition to the drought conditions, the municipality has also experienced a number of mechanical and electrical breakdowns. &ldquo;Water trucks have been sent to all affected communities, with reinforcements in Ngqushwa, Mnquma and Mbhashe municipalities.&rdquo;
