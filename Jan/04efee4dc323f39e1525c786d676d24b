TO these residents, rain means utter misery!People in Potlo Village, Matatiele, Eastern Cape struggle to cross the river to get to shops and schools and old people have to battle to get to grant paypoints.Villagers spend mornings and afternoons helping kids cross the river to get to school.Resident Thabiso Molaoa (38) said they have to cross the river because there is no road and public transport can only be reached from a nearby village. &ldquo;It is very dangerous and now that the river is full, we are scared people may drown.&rdquo; He said they had to decide whether to let their children stay at home or risk their lives so they could go to school.He said since 2009, efforts to get the Matatiele Municipality to build a proper road have been unsuccessful. All the municipality has done over the years was visit the area, take photos and make empty promises.Grade five pupil Mbalentle Mguzulwa (11) said they struggle to get to school and when they get there, they are wet and tired and can&rsquo;t concentrate. She said she sleeps at a relative&rsquo;s house in Nkwawu Village when it rains.Matatiele mayor Momelezi Mbedla confirmed that the municipality faces problems with road maintenance.
