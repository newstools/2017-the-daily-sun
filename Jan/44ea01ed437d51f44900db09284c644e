Kaizer Chiefs have commemorated the Orkney Stadium disaster that sadly took the lives of 42 supporters after a Fani Madida equaliser against Orlando Pirates led to a stampede in 1991.The tragic affair took place 26 years ago in a friendly match between the two fierce rivals from Soweto. As such, Chiefs Chairman Kaizer Motaung has expressed sympathy to those that passed away that day.He told the club's official website: "The fallen will always be in our memory. We have a tradition at Chiefs of recalling the high and low points in our history as a club."The Orkney disaster is certainly a dark moment. Every year we stand still to commemorate what happened that day. This is also why we played the legends game in August 2015 - to honour those that lost their lives."On behalf of Chiefs, I would like to extend words of sympathy to the family and friends of the departed ones."
