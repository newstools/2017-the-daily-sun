HAPPY Fumane watched in shock as her expensive glass table exploded on Wednesday and the shattered glass danced like popcorn. The 43-year-old businesswoman from Winterveld in Tshwane said she and her family were still traumatised by the incident, during which lightning almost struck her! Happy said the lightning struck just a split second after she got up from the table to look for a magazine she had left in her bedroom.She said the most disturbing thing was that a bottle containing sea water and sand, which had been left on the table, didn&rsquo;t break. She said shortly after getting up from the table at about 1.30pm, she heard a loud bang as if a gun had been fired.When she looked back, she saw the table&rsquo;s glass lying shattered on the floor. &ldquo;The pieces of broken glass looked like hail and were jumping up and down like popcorn in a pan.&rdquo; Happy said the table had been standing in her dining-room since 2013 and she had never had a problem with heavy rain or lightning before. After the incident, she immediately called members of her church and a sangoma. &ldquo;The sangoma told us the lightning was supposed to burn down my house but we were saved by the sea water,&rdquo; claimed Happy.&ldquo;She said the shattered glass was jumping up and down because the person who sent the lightning was running away to bath in the sea.&rdquo; Members of her church prayed over the splinters and eventually cleaned up the pieces of glass and the mess. Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said the lighting had been sent to burn down Happy&rsquo;s house.&ldquo;She has very powerful ancestors but she needs to consult a strong sangoma so that she can work on the house. &ldquo;She must make sure that she is strong because she&rsquo;s got very dangerous enemies.&rdquo;
