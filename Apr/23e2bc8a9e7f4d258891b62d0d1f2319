&ldquo;SHUT down the municipality and elect other officials!&rdquo;This was the demand from residents of major townships in Ditsobotla Municipality, North West who are unhappy with services. They say nothing is being done for them. First it was Itsoseng kasi near Lichtenburg, where people have been protesting month after month.Now it is Blydeville residents across the road from Lichtenburg. A police van was overturned by protesters and an Nyala was set alight as police tried but failed to control the protesters.North West police spokesman Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone confirmed that the Nyala was set alight but said the situation was now calm. He said a tavern and beer hole were also burned. Since Friday people have been moving about normally during the day, but at about 4pm the trouble starts.Seven more people were arrested for public violence following the arrest of 14 at the weekend. Sources told Daily Sun the people plan to burn down the municipality offices if they don&rsquo;t get the leadership they want.Ditsobotla mayor Daniel Buthelezi is due to address the media today. Earlier he condemned the violence. He called for representatives of the Concerned Residents group to stop instigating violence. He said it was not true that the land identified for town establishment for Blydeville extension 4 has been sold and the Lichtenburg Ho&euml;rskool will be privatised.&ldquo;This is pure propaganda,&rdquo; said the mayor.City Press reports that the small farming town of Coligny, North West, resembled a war zone on Tuesday afternoon, with large clouds of smoke billowing from parts of town.All entry points into town were guarded by armed white men who said they were protecting their properties. Three houses were burnt and damaged earlier this morning.
