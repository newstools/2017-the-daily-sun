AS HE tries to accommodate as many players as possible for his first training camp for the 2017 Fifa Under-20 World Cup next month, Amajita coach Thabo Senong has delayed naming his squad until tomorrow.Senong was due to name a squad of 26 players but told SunSport yesterday that the number might increase to 28 as they try to give more players a chance to prove themselves.Some 90% of the Amajita players that took part in the Africa Youth Cup of Nations in Zambia will be automatically considered for this camp. The squad will be trimmed down to the final 21 early in May.SunSport can confirm that 19-year-old Bidvest Wits defender Reeve Frosler will be part of the Amajita squad set for the first camp ahead of the world showpiece, which kicks off in less than six weeks and runs from 20 May until 11 June. Amajita&rsquo;s defence was leaky at the Youth Afcon in Zambia last month, as they conceded nine goals, most of which came from set-pieces. Frosler, who was recently promoted to Wits&rsquo; first team after a standout performance in the MultiChoice Diski Challenge, could prove to be the missing piece of the puzzle in Amajita&rsquo;s defensive line. Other players likely to appear at their second World Cup with a junior national team are Mondli Mpoto, Notha Ngcobo, Katlego Mohamme,Sibongakonke Mbatha, Thendo Mukumela, Khanyisa Mayo, Kobamelo Kodisang, Sanele Tshabalala and Khulekani Kubheka.Senong said: &ldquo;There are a few things that have been holding us back but the squad will be known before the end of this week.&rdquo;Frosler is on the verge of playing in his second World Cup at junior level after being part of the SA&rsquo;s junior national team in 2015 and the Under-17 squad that competed in the World Cup in Chile the same year.The youngster missed out in the recent U-20 Afcon where Amajita finished fourth and qualified for the U-20 World Cup in South Korea.
