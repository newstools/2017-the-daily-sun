WHEN villagers saw makotis wearing doeks and blankets, and sitting at the back of a truck on Monday, they were happy as they thought someone had paid lobola for women from the area. But their joy later turned to shock when they realised what they thought were makotis were actually stolen goats dressed up as people! The villagers realised what was going on when one of the fake makotis fell off the back of the truck and they saw it was an animal. When they went to check the truck, they found stolen livestock.The residents of about 40 villages in Impendle in the KZN Midlands have now warned that they will take the law into their own hands if the cops fail to arrest all suspected stock thieves in the area. A resident (67) of KwaNovuka Village said the community is tired of thieves. &ldquo;We work hard to buy these goats. We pay for them with money from piece jobs or our pension grants and we won&rsquo;t allow thugs to get easy cash at our expense,&rdquo; he said. He said five of his goats went missing three weeks ago and he never recovered them. A resident (47) of Emakholweni Village said the thieves were provoking them. &ldquo;This is annoying and they will regret their actions if this continues,&rdquo; he said. Induna Tallman Zuma said stock theft had risen since the end of last year. &ldquo;What is worrying us is that the police arrest some suspects but our stock continues to go missing,&rdquo; he said. Captain Nqobile Gwala said three goats were stolen on Monday. &ldquo;The goats were recovered on Monday and a 24-year-old suspect was arrested. He was charged with stock theft and appeared in the Impendle Magistrates on Tuesday.&rdquo;
