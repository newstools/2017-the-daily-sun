FOLLOWING two weeks of violent disruption by taxi operators claiming to fight drug dealers in Polokwane, Limpopo, the police decided to join in to clean up the province&rsquo;s capital city. They confiscated counterfeit goods on Monday and arrested several illegal immigrants while summoning unlicensed operators in the city. The clean-up is set to continue in and around the city this festive season and beyond.Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, Limpopo cops&rsquo; spokesman, said the operation was a success. &ldquo;Nine undocumented immigrants were arrested. A spaza shop was closed and the manager was given section 33 notices to appear before an immigration officer to ascertain if he is registered with SARS and to verify the legality of his asylum.&rdquo;He said two vehicles were impounded after it was found that their licence discs expired in 2015. Ngoepe said the Polokwane and Westenburg areas have experienced an increase in drug-related crimes lately but unfortunately no drug dealers were arrested on Monday. &ldquo;The operation was led by the cluster commander, Brigadier Dikeledi Mangena and included various police stations, units and other role-players,&rdquo; he said.
