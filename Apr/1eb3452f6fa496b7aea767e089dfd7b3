Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba is off to the US to meet with investors and global financial in an effort to revive Mzansi&rsquo;s economy.Speaking at a press conference earlier today, Gigaba said they would be meeting with institutions like the World Bank and the IMF to discuss global economic trends. The minister and his team would also be meeting leaders from different countries to encourage good relationships, especially Africa and the Brics group (Brazil, Russia, India and China).Gigaba also said that they will be meeting with ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s, which is one of the big three besides S&amp;P and Fitch. Both S&amp;P and Fitch recently downgraded South Africa to &ldquo;junk&rdquo; status, making the country and its companies less attractive to investors and seriously threatening Mzansi&rsquo;s economy.The situation will get worse if Moody&rsquo;s did the same. The ratings agency has given South Africa 90 days to convince it that it should not also downgrade the country to junk status.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to meet with Moody&rsquo;s to give assurance in terms of policy direction of the government,&rdquo; said Gigaba.He also distanced himself from the views expressed on the weekend by his adviser, Professor Chris Malikane. Malikane called for banks and mines to be nationalised.The finance minister admitted that the Cabinet reshuffle had left investors and ratings agencies concerned, and that during the trip he would be &ldquo;talking up&rdquo; the country to ensure continued confidence.
