RESIDENTS claim the councillor candidate promised them RDPs and a better life if they voted for him in last year&rsquo;s government elections.Residents fulfilled their part of the deal and Sbusiso Ngcobo was elected councillor.But now the residents of Mariannridge in Durban have had their shacks demolished by the same man they put in power.Residents said some shacks were demolished last Tuesday and the others last Friday.Resident Sebenzile Zwane (49) said they were shocked that Ngcobo had changed his tune.&ldquo;He would visit us twice a week during election season to ask for our votes. He told us we would get RDPs if we voted for him. &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve voted for him, he tells us we&rsquo;re not wanted here,&rdquo; said Sebenzile.Sicelo Gasa (38), another resident, said the councillor came with security guards to demolish their shacks. &ldquo;He told us we had to leave because he wanted to use the area for something else. He didn&rsquo;t tell us where to go to,&rdquo; said Sicelo.Ngcobo confirmed that the shacks were demolished.&ldquo;I campaigned for the votes of residents who live in the area legally, not the group who built their shacks this year because they heard RDPs would be built,&rdquo; said Ngcobo.&ldquo;I will never betray the people who voted for me. I still maintain the RDPs will be built, but only for residents who are there legally.&rdquo;
