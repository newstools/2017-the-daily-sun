Bloemfontein Celtic interim coach Lehlohonolo Seema lavished praise on the Premiership side after gaining a credible 0-0 draw against Mamelodi Sundowns.The goalless draw moved the relegation threatened side into 11th place, a single point above Orlando Pirates and stretched their run without conceding a goal to four games.Seema, who's serving as caretaker coach until manager Luc Eyamel's contractual dispute with former club Polokwane City is resolved; claimed Siwelele met their target with four points in their last two league games."The guys fought hard today. We were expecting a tough game. Credit must go to the players, they left everything out on the field," Seema said after the game.&nbsp;"Our mission is accomplished, we were looking for four points in these two away games [against Polokwane City and Mamelodi Sundowns] and we have got the four points and can build from there."We had our chances and we could have buried them. [Dumisani] Zuma had the last chance and he could have taken a touch and called me from the bench to have come and finished it but he's a youngster and he'll learn from that."We are happy overall with the performance of the guys."
