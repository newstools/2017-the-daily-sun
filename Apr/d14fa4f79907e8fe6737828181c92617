SABC1&rsquo;S new daytime talk show, Daily Thetha, has been dealt a blow barely a year since its launch.Insiders claimed the show&rsquo;s head of content Msizi Nkosi left the production &ldquo;without any clear reasons&rdquo;.But Msizi, who left his producing job at Ukhozi FM&rsquo;s Woza Nabangani Bakho afternoon drive-time show for Daily Thetha, cleared the air on his Facebook page.According to the talented broadcaster, he was merely taking time off to focus on his new venture, a salon called EdKing Lifestyle, based in Southgate Mall, south of Joburg.Said Msizi in some of his posts: &ldquo;I did come back to Jozi, for four years. I helped make the show the biggest afternoon drive show in Africa. I then published a national bestseller. I&rsquo;m a columnist. I&rsquo;ve just launched a boutique salon on Saturday.&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve had to resign as head of content for Daily Thetha to focus on this for the next three months and to grow this baby. I&rsquo;ll come back to the media world soon. &ldquo;In terms of material possessions, I&rsquo;m not successful yet. In terms of following your dreams, resilience and defying the odds, I&rsquo;m successful beyond measure. I&rsquo;m blessed. I keep relaunching myself. For me, this is life . . . I&rsquo;m living. I&rsquo;m following my dreams. I&rsquo;m pushing boundaries. Don&rsquo;t stop dreaming.&rdquo; When contacted for comment, Msizi said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not leaving per se, but I&rsquo;m taking a three-month break to focus on my business. &ldquo;As to when I&rsquo;ll be back will be decided after three months.&rdquo;
