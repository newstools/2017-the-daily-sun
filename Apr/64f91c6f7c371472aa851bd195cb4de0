PLATINUM Stars head coach Cavin Johnson has told his players to &ldquo;come to the party&rdquo; and make sure Dikwena pocket three points when they meet Free State Stars in an Absa Premiership relegation battle at the Moruleng Stadium tonight (7.30pm).Johnson &ndash; never one to mince his words &ndash; is expecting his attacking players, Benson Shilongo, Bonginkosi Ntuli, Ndumiso Mabena to open up the Ea Lla Koto defence.Johnson admitted this was &ldquo;one of the club&rsquo;s biggest games&rdquo; of the season.Dikwena are in 11th spot with 25 points &ndash; four ahead of 14th placed Ea Lla Koto as the dreaded relegation dog fight hots up.Said Johnson: &ldquo;We have to collect three points, that&rsquo;s the bottom line. It is very, very tight. This is a vital match and possibly the biggest we have faced this season as a win would virtually make us safe. We have to beat FS Stars at home.&rdquo;Johnson also wants his side to redeem themselves after they were beaten 1-0 in a controversial Nedbank Cup quarterfinal clash away to Golden Arrows last weekend.Dikwena were denied what looked a blatant penalty late in the match, but Johnson refused to blame anyone for Dikwena&rsquo;s cup exit.Said Johnson: &ldquo;We simply have to pull up our socks and get out of the rut we&rsquo;re in in the PSL.&rdquo;Johnson appealed to their fans in the North West to come out in numbers and support their team: &ldquo;My plea is to the people of North West to help us and support their team. &ldquo;We need the locals to come out in numbers for this important game. Seeing a big crowd would be a massive boost to the players.&rdquo; Johnson and his players deserve the backing of fans. Johnson defied the odds by guiding Dikwena into the group stages of the Caf Confederation Cup for the first time in the club&rsquo;s history.Dikwena overturned a 2-0 deficit from Ivory Coast&rsquo;s AS Tanda to win the tie on a penalty shoot-out to advance along with SuperSport United to the group stage of the continental competition.Said Johnson: &ldquo;Games are coming thick and fast with a game almost every 48 hours, but we have to get on with it and make sure we pick up points.&rdquo;Dikwena face a gruelling schedule with five matches in the next 10 days, starting with tonight&rsquo;s clash.
