LOUD music, rowdy crowds, empty beer bottles and smelly urine is what these residents have to deal with every week.Three churches, a clinic, schools and households in Zone 3 of Diepkloof, Soweto have had enough of the patrons at a local shisa nyama.From Thursday evening until Sunday, boozers park their cars near the shisa nyama and play loud music from their cars.On Sunday mornings, residents have to pick up broken bottles, sweep away rubbish and wash away streams of stale urine. Sometimes they find used condoms on the ground.Resident Eugene Mokautu told Daily Sun they have spoken to the owner, who told them he just owns the property and doesn&rsquo;t know what happens there.&ldquo;We have sent a list of grievances to the office of the mayor, but we haven&rsquo;t received any help. &ldquo;We have also written to the Joburg Metro Police Department. They pretend to monitor the situation, but they don&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;One resident said he was beaten up for telling boozers not to park in front of his gate.Joey Lebeloane, another resident, said patrons play loud music until the early hours of the morning.&ldquo;What will happen if you need to take an old person to hospital at night and your gate is blocked?&rdquo;He said the community wants the municipality and the liquor board to intervene.Tony Taverna-Turisan, Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba&rsquo;s spokesman, said this was the first time they had been made aware of the situation. &ldquo;We are deeply concerned by the allegations and have forwarded this matter to the department of public safety for urgent intervention.&ldquo;Mayor Mashaba has stated on numerous occasions that we will bring back the rule of law to our city. &ldquo;It is essential that our communities are able to live in peace in their homes.&rdquo;
