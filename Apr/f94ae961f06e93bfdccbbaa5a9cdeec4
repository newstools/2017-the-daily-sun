LUC Eymael is NOT going back to Polokwane City! This is despite the ruling by the PSL&rsquo;s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) on Tuesday that Eymael must return to his former employers, Polokwane City, in Limpopo.Eymael actually confessed to SunSport that he regrets not having taken a job offer in Sudan, then he wouldn&rsquo;t be in this mess to begin with.His frustrations started when Rise and Shine boss Johnny Mogaladi lodged a complaint against him, saying he breached his contract when he resigned in March to join Bloemfontein Celtic two days later.The case has prevented the Belgian coach from starting his job in Bloemfontein despite having acquired his work permit, as the PSL refused to register him with Celtic until the case was finalised.A fuming Eymael told SunSport yesterday that he would appeal the decision he said was &ldquo;not human&rdquo;.Said Eymael: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand their ruling and I will never go back. This is unfair and not human. The people who made the decision didn&rsquo;t watch on TV how I was abused &ndash; I left Polokwane with scratches. I came here to coach soccer, not to start a war or die.&rdquo; Eymael says the PSL DRC won&rsquo;t be able to protect him. &ldquo;I want to stay alive because I have two kids and a grandson. I don&rsquo;t want to put my life in danger. I won&rsquo;t be forced by somebody to work somewhere I am not comfortable. &ldquo;I can get injured or lose my life &ndash; the DRC won&rsquo;t protect me.&rdquo;The 54 year-old insisted that his relationship with Polokwane was abusive: &ldquo;Polokwane showed exactly what they do at half-time during the game (1-0 league defeat to Celtic on 2 April). This is a bad image for the club and for soccer in this country. Now I have become a victim. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what they want from me. But one thing is for sure, I won&rsquo;t go to a place where my life is in danger. &ldquo;It would be stupid if I do that, like a girlfriend who always returns to an abusive lover.&rdquo;Despite the setback, Eymael is optimistic the tough times will pass and he will get to guide Phunya Sele Sele from the bench instead of sitting in the grandstands.&ldquo;People want to spoil my life and reputation. But the truth will come out.&rdquo;
