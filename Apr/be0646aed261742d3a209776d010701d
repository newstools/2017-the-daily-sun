DISCIPLINARY hearings for 12 public works department officials accused of acting unlawfully in the R246 million security upgrade of President Jacob Zuma's Nkandla homestead are expected to continue today.The disciplinary hearings were postponed yesterday when one of the accused, Sibusiso Chonco, failed to attend.Representing Chonco, lawyer Adrian Moodley said his client had been given a sick note by a doctor who booked him off from 29 March to 29 April.Moodley pleaded with chairperson Thulani Khuzwayo in the hopes of a postponement.However, the lawyer representing the department, Clement Kulati, said that proceedings had been suspended for far too long. He said that if Chonco was booked off sick in March, he should have informed the disciplinary officials.In postponing proceedings for the day, Khuzwayo said that the disciplinary would continue today with or without Chonco.In her 2014 report, former public protector Advocate Thuli Madonsela found that Zuma and his family unduly benefitted from R246 million in upgrades to his Nkandla homestead.Zuma denied the findings of the report and the matter was taken to the Constitutional Court.In its judgment on 31 March, the Constitutional Court ordered Treasury to determine the "reasonable amount" Zuma should repay.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/nkandla-hearings-continue-for-officials-accused-of-misconduct-during-upgrades-20170425
