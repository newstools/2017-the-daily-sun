BLACK Leopards forward Siphelele &ldquo;Stash&rdquo; Ntshangase reckons all is not lost &ndash; they still have a lot to play for against National First Division (NFD) log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu.The two sides have a date in the battle for first place in the standings at Umhlathuze Sports Complex in Richards Bay this afternoon (3pm).Ntshangase said this highly anticipated match could give a glimpse of where the NFD title was headed. He said: &ldquo;We understand the odds are stacked against us. We are playing a team that has yet to lose at home and has been at the top of the table for a long time. &ldquo;We know all of that and it doesn&rsquo;t intimidate us. We are here for three points and we will get them. There&rsquo;s a lot at stake for both teams. To us this is a final.&rdquo;Lidoda Duvha, who arrived in Richards Bay on Sunday, face Amabhubesi on the back of a 2-1 defeat at home to Thanda&rsquo;s provincial neighbours, Real Kings United, on Saturday. That defeat dented their hopes of narrowing Thanda&rsquo;s lead to six. They are now nine points behind the leaders who drew 1-1 away to Jomo Cosmos on Sunday. Despite all that, the former Under-23 forward remains hopeful: &ldquo;We seem to do well away from home. We feel no pressure and that is why I&rsquo;m confident we will beat Thanda. &ldquo;All we need to do is take our chances, which we failed to do against Kings.&rdquo; Amabhubesi, meanwhile, go into this match looking to extend their unbeaten run at home to 12 matches. They collected 29 points out of a possible 33 in their 11 previous matches &ndash; meaning they have won nine and drew two. According to their coach, Roger Sikhakhane, this is an important match: &ldquo;Our battle plan is clear, all we need to do is go on an all out attack against them. &ldquo;We are playing at home, so there is no need to sit back. Away we played to a 0-0 draw but this time things will be different.&rdquo;
