FORMER Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza reported for duty this morning, in defiance of a high court order setting aside his appointment, and then signed out an official vehicle.Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said he would not leave the Hawks premises until Ntlemeza returned his cellphone and the car he was "roaming around the streets of Pretoria with".This prompted South Africa's Twitterati to join the search. Here are some of the funny tweets from the Twitter detectives.Fortunately enough I have spotted #Ntlemeza @RediTlhabi can I get my 5K pic.twitter.com/W6q1GV3MsQ&mdash; #Vusimuzi_Ntombela (@CallMeVoto) April 24, 2017 #BerningNtlemeza in hiding.... #fikilembalula #Hawks pic.twitter.com/vhMa3y8NcN&mdash; Jabu Khuluse (@JabuKhuluse) April 24, 2017 You're fired but you still coming to work...pay day uthi kuzoba njani?#ntlemeza pic.twitter.com/s3Kky8AfKm&mdash; Outie eGrand (@This_is_Njabulo) April 24, 2017
