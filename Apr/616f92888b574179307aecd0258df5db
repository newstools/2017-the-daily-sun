RESIDENTS of Khayelitsha&rsquo;s YB and YT sections are worried . . . Their kids will get sick because the public toilets don&rsquo;t have doors, and they blame the municipality for this, saying its plumbers won&rsquo;t fix them! &ldquo;We cover the toilet seats with concrete blocks to protect kids from illness,&rdquo; said local leader Noluvo Zweni. The toilets apparently became blocked between August and October, but when thugs stole the doors the situation became worse. &ldquo;Kids dip their hands inside toilet seats that are covered with faeces and risk catching diseases,&rdquo; said Zweni.&ldquo;When the toilets got blocked, we reported this to officials and caretakers. But city plumbers never showed up.&rdquo; When a toilet is flushed, water gushes from the pipes and spews all over the inside and outside of the toilets. &ldquo;Kids play with it, not knowing it endangers their health,&rdquo; she said.Another local leader, Xolani Dastile, said the blocks on the seats show passersby that the toilets are damaged. &ldquo;Residents from other sections relieve themselves in the blocked toilets if they&rsquo;re not covered. When they&rsquo;re removed, flies buzz around and a stench fouls up the air.&rdquo; The locals clean the toilets themselves . . . Community leaders occasionally hire local plumbers to fix the blocked toilets, broken toilet tanks and pipes.&ldquo;We pay them R180 to fix the toilet tank so it can flush again,&rdquo; Dastile said, Councillor Anda Ntsodo said: &ldquo;A project manager will arrange to meet with the ward councillor this week to investigate all complaints.&rdquo; He urged them to report such cases on 0860 103 089.
