A VOICE clip describing horrors committed by evil taximen has sent ripples of fear through the kasi. This after a pregnant woman was raped and burned, along with her boyfriend, when they asked the taximen for help. Cops are now looking for murder suspects after the woman died from her injuries. The woman in the voicemail recording, who sounds scared, warns people not to get into any taxi that has only men as occupants, claiming they too could become easy targets. A source close to the investigation told Daily Sun three people were walking home in Tshepisong in Kagiso, west of Joburg, when a woman was knocked over by a minibus taxi driving on the pavement. &ldquo;Her boyfriend ran after the taxi and asked the driver to take his girlfriend to hospital. &ldquo;The taxi stopped and an argument started between the driver and the man,&rdquo; the source said. The driver agreed to take the woman to hospital, but instead drove in another direction to an isolated spot where the couple was badly assaulted. Petrol was poured over them and they were set alight. &ldquo;They were left in the bushes. &ldquo;The man managed to reach a nearby street, where he stopped women who were on their way to church. &ldquo;A motorist then took them to hospital,&rdquo; the source said. The woman died in hospital on Sunday morning, while her boyfriend is fighting for his life. Another source said the incident was reported at the Roodepoort Police Station before the case was transferred to Kagiso. West Rand cluster police spokesman Constable Lucky Matome confirmed that Kagiso police were investigating cases of attempted murder and reckless driving. &ldquo;An additional charge of murder was added after the victim lost her life,&rdquo; he said.
