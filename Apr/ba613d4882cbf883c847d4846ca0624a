THE rise of social media interaction has seen many people becoming liars &ndash; just to keep up.&nbsp; They do this to follow latest trends and be seen to be &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. And those who can&rsquo;t own up to their normal lives have now created an online illusion of their lives which, at times, can be misleading. Recently, a well-known female TV presenter posted a picture with this caption: &ldquo;I like it when bae or boyfriend takes pictures of me.&rdquo; But a mirror in the background showed that she was alone, with no sign of a bae or boyfriend! Kaya FM&rsquo;s senior online manager and content specialist Motlagae Konyane said the world was changing rapidly and no one wanted to be left behind. &ldquo;Being perceived to be rich is seen as the in thing right now. In most cases, social media gives people the power to create a certain lifestyle, so that they can be seen as living great life,&rdquo; she said. Motlagae explained that most people thought having cash equated to happiness. But for Motlagae, this is just a false front, as not everyone aspires to be rich. &ldquo;Money can&rsquo;t always be used as a measure of success. The illusion that money equates to happiness is really flawed,&rdquo; she said. Stylist and student, Katlego Molomo, said his fashion knowledge had given him a platform to be one of the influencers on social media. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a huge following on Facebook, and my Instagram and Twitter are steadily growing. &ldquo;I only post when I&rsquo;m out, having a good time! But my outfits and make-up are what&rsquo;s getting me a huge following,&rdquo; he said. Katlego added that he had never lied about his life and financial status because he couldn&rsquo;t keep lying to cover up his &ldquo;online fabulous lifestyle&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real, and when I&rsquo;m in a situation where I&rsquo;m living it up, I show that. &ldquo;Also, when I&rsquo;m not having a great time, I also share it. It&rsquo;s all about balance for me,&rdquo; he said. Mamorena Mmutle likes to be relevant. She said she travelled a lot for work, but when she posted on social media, she didn&rsquo;t say she&rsquo;s on a business trip. She said: &ldquo;Why should I be too honest? The fact of the matter is I&rsquo;ll be in that particular place. &ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t matter if I didn&rsquo;t pay for the trip myself. The fact is I&rsquo;m there and my followers need to see that I&rsquo;m living it up. &ldquo;I get hurt sometimes when I don&rsquo;t get likes for a post I spent time editing and drafting &ndash; but it comes with the territory,&rdquo; Mamorena said. She said telling a white lie didn&rsquo;t mean the teller was a pathological liar. She went on to say: &ldquo;I guess we all use social media for different reasons, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s right or wrong for a certain group.&rdquo;
