TAXIS and jikelezas had to find alternative routes when streets were blocked by angry residents yesterday morning.Khayelitsha in Uitenhage was covered in smoke as people took to the streets, warning that everything would come to a standstill.This was after residents were chased from Mondile Street in Jagvlakte (also known as Emfuleni Wothando), where they had built shacks next to a pigsty. People have been living there since 13 January.The court sheriff, accompanied by police, broke down shacks with bulldozers, threw planks and zinc onto trucks, and dumped them elsewhere.The pigs were left undisturbed.Resident Ayanda Hompa (28) said: &ldquo;They give the land to pigs instead of us. We have lost our case in court although we hired lawyers. The municipality demolished our shacks without informing us first. The police said they would shoot us if we resisted, so we took to the streets.&rdquo;Spaza owners closed their shops as marching protesters approached.The residents who fled their shacks included disabled people, orphans, backyard dwellers and gogos.The land stretches all the way to Kayamandi in Despatch and has been earmarked by the municipality for 500 RDPs.
