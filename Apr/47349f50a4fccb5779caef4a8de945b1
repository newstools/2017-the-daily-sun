Arsenal are not commenting on widespread speculation that they have agreed a deal to sign FC Schalke 04 defender Sead Kolasinac.The Bosnian left-back is out-of-contract at the end of the season and has been linked with several leading Premier League clubs, including Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City.But there have been reports in the UK that Arsenal have sealed a deal for the 23-year-old, despite the question marks over Arsene Wenger&rsquo;s future at the Emirates.Arsenal are staying silent on the transfer talk, yet there are likely to be wholesale changes at the club, regardless of whether Wenger is in charge.Schalke academy product Kolasinac has made 117 first-team appearances over the past four-and-a-half years, and admitted earlier this season that he would consider a move to the Premier League.He said: "Many say my style of play would fit well in England. But if I move abroad, not only the club changes, but you leave your environment, need to build something new."It's a difficult step which has to be well-considered. The gut feeling decides, and I also need to talk to my family."
