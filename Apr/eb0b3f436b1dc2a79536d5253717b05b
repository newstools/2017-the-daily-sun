Wits have 41 points from 20 matches while second placed Cape Town City have 39 points from 21 games.

Coach Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s charges made it easy with a 2-0 victory. Hunt made five changes from his squad that played against Al Ahly. The first half didn&rsquo;t stood up to its expectation as both teams lacked to create goal scoring chances. However, Wits meant business in the second half and they deservedly got the opener through Phakamani Mahlambi in the 57th minute. Gabadinho Mhango&rsquo;s header was well saved goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela but Mahlambi converted on a rebound. Stars had few chances in the first half and striker Bonginkosi Ntuli beat goalkeeper Darren Keet but his goal was ruled offside. The Clever Boys sealed the game in the 87th minute when Daine Klate scored from the penalty spot after midfielder Thabang Monare was brought down inside the box. Wits will go into Tuesday&rsquo;s clash against Jomo Cosmos in the Nedbank Cup last 16 at Tsakane Stadium on a high spirit.
