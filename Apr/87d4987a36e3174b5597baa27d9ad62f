THERE was high drama at the State of the Capital address today when a fight broke out between metro cops and an ANC councillor.Police came in twice asking ANC to leave the hall. The heated exchange continued with other councillors joining in the fight.Some ANC councillors were seen swinging red belts at metro police dressed in civilian clothes. It was quickly stopped and the leader of the ANC phoned newly appointed minister of police Fikile Mbalula to remove police.The disruptions delayed Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga from delivering his state of the capital address for four hours.Police left the hall and the budget speech was moved to a dining area across the road.The chaos began when ANC members demanded that the City of Tshwane speaker Katlego Mathebe postpone the sitting in honour of Solomon Mahlangu.Yesterday marked the 38th anniversary of Mahlangu execution."True to form, the ANC today disrupted the Executive Mayor of Tshwane's maiden State of the Capital Address at the Tshwane Events Centre. In doing so, they have completely undermined the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, the will of the people and the Rule of Law."This is symptomatic of an ANC in complete chaos as they continue to reach new lows," Msimanga's spokesman Samkelo Mgobozi said.Mgobozi said the conduct of the ANC will be dealt with according to the rules of council."The City duly elected to proceed with the State of the Capital Address to demonstrate to the people of Tshwane where we have come from and announce to our people how we are going to deliver better services and provide opportunities so that they may live a better life as envisioned by Solomon Mahlangu and many other struggle heroes," he said.Meanwhile ANC councillors said they had made a call to Mbalula to report the matter.Leader of the opposition in the ANC Mapiti Matsena told ANC members that Mbalula had spoken to a police colonel demanding that someone take responsibility for any violence that may occur.He encouraged ANC members to fight back if provoked by the police.Msimanga will pay tribute to Mahlangu and set out his plans to give effect to his legacy to the people for whom he sacrificed his life as has always been the case when this decision was taken in September last year where the ANC in Council failed to register any dissenting vote, Mgobozi said."We will not be deterred by this," Mgobozi said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/police-in-standoff-with-anc-at-tshwane-council-meeting-20170406
