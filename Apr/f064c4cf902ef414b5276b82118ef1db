Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler believes former club Bidvest Wits are favourites to win the league title and claims he would be happy with a top three spot.City have been surprise league challengers in their first season of existence and they currently occupy the top of the table.But Bidvest Wits and Kaizer Chiefs are just one point behind, with defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns a further point back.Having seen his team fighting back for a 1-1 draw with the Clever Boys in midweek, Tinkler says he feels it's his former employers who are best-placed to win the title."Wits must have the edge in the title race because they are out of the [Nedbank] cup. He [coach Gavin Hunt] has got a good time now to recover."This weekend I'm sure he's going to give the guys two days off which he wouldn't have had they been in the cup. So I think they are definitely favourites. Sundowns are obviously still involved in the CAF and we know what those journeys are like."The former Wits and Bafana Bafana midfielder claims he would be more than happy to finish in the top three."We've achieved above our expectations for this season," said Tinkler. "We're playing now to try and break our own records, every day we pitch up for training, every day we pick a point we break our own records so there&rsquo;s no pressure there."We would obviously want to finish in the top five, we would love to finish in the top three, who knows? Maybe we do win the league a lot can still happen.
