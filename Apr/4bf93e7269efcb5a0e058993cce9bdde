ENOCH Mokoena loved his wife and when she introduced her family to her husband, he welcomed them with open arms. However, on Friday afternoon he claims he caught his wife in bed with the man she had claimed was her brother! Enoch made these claims despite his wife, Helen Noziphelo, saying they separated in December!The 53-year-old from Joburg told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I had gone to Limpopo and I returned home without telling my wife. When I got home I found the bedroom door locked. I was shocked when I heard a man&rsquo;s voice inside.&rdquo;Enoch said he asked his wife to open the door but she refused. &ldquo;As I tried to force the door open, a man suddenly came out and threw acid into my face. &ldquo;He then chased me out of my own house. I had to run to my family&rsquo;s home in Soweto.&rdquo; Enoch said when he went back the following day his neighbours told him the other man had moved into his flat. He said the man had often visited his home.&ldquo;I never expected him to sleep with my wife. I was told he was my wife&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;Helen (51) said she didn&rsquo;t want to hear from Enoch anymore. &ldquo;We separated in December but he keeps coming to my flat. I can do what I want with my life.&rdquo; She said her lover threw acid at Enoch because he tried to force his way into her room. &ldquo;I will go to the police station and get a protection order against him,&rdquo; she said. Hillbrow police spokesman Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo said a case of assault was opened.
