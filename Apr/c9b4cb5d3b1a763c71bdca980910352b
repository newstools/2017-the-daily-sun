A self-proclaimed pastor has reportedly been sentenced to 15 years behind bars after being found guilty of raping an 8-year-old congregant in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. According to the state-owned Chronicle newspaper, Clayton Nkala, 26, pleaded not guilty to the charge, but overwhelming evidence before the court led to his conviction. Magistrate Chrispen Mberewere sentenced Nkala to 15 years in jail, but suspended 5 years of the the sentence on condition of good behaviour. The court heard that Nkala &ndash; a soldier with the Zimbabwe National Army &ndash; "pounced on the young girl sometime in April 2015 as she was picking tins at a nearby dump site with her young sister and dragged her into the bush where he raped her". The girl's mother noticed that something had gone wrong when she saw stains of blood on her daughter's panties while doing laundry the following day.&nbsp;The unnamed mother sought help from Nkala, and one of the church elders &ndash; who advised that the matter be reported to the police. Nkala, however, refused to accompany them to a nearby police station.The girl then told a church elder a week later that the pastor was her attacker, leading to his arrest.&nbsp;Last month police in the Gweru arrested a couple for allegedly kidnapping a 14-year-old girl before the woman assisted her husband to rape her by holding her hands.Philemon Moyo Tauze, 30, and his wife Netsai Sibanda, 25, appeared before a court facing charges of kidnapping and raping a minor.News24 Source http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/self-proclaimed-pastor-gets-15-years-for-raping-girl-8-20170329
