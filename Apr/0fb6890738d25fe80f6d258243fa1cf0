HE thought he&rsquo;d found love, but it turned out to be false.The 44-year-old man claims he discovered that his lovely wife was a stokvel crook! He says she has disappeared, leaving him to deal with angry stokvel members who claim she robbed them. The man from Germiston, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun the trouble started in 2014 when his 40-year-old wife formed a stokvel group without telling him. Stokvel members say they have been cheated out of R11 000.&ldquo;Every day I get calls and messages from angry women. They threaten me and swear at me, demanding their money back.&rdquo;The man is now afraid to walk down the street. He fears what the people his wife owes will do to him.&ldquo;They demand that I tell them where she is, but I have no idea. When I got back from work on Saturday, I found our shack locked and all her clothes gone. &ldquo;I called her brother and family but none of them had seen her.&rdquo;He claimed that when he returns home from work he often finds angry women standing at his door, looking for his wife.&ldquo;They told me that she stole R11 000 from their stokvel savings and they want it back.&rdquo;Germiston police spokesman Sergeant Styles Maome confirmed that a case of theft was opened for investigation.&ldquo;No one has been arrested at this stage.&rdquo;
