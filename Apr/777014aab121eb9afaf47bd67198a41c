HER two boys didn&rsquo;t want to go to school on Friday morning, so mum Florence bribed them with a promise of their favourite meal when they returned.But they never made it back home, because the minibus taxi they and others were travelling in crashed into a truck near Bronkhorstspruit and burst into flames, killing 18 pupils and two adults.Florence and Ernest Maziba, from Verena in Mkobola, Mpumalanga and the parents of the other dead pupils have been left heartbroken.The accident happened on Friday afternoon as the children were being driven home.Florence said Thembelani (12) was in grade 6 at Refano Primary Farm School, and Siyabonga (8) was in grade 1. &ldquo;They told me on Friday morning they didn&rsquo;t want to go to school,&rdquo; said Florence.&ldquo;They were not sick &ndash; they had no reason to stay home.&rdquo; The mother of five said she forced them to go to school and promised she would prepare a special, seven-colours meal for them. &ldquo;They finally agreed to go. When I walked with them to the taxi, Siyabonga kept looking back. He did not want to leave. &ldquo;When we later arrived at the accident scene I didn&rsquo;t see anything but fire. I closed my eyes, praying to God and hoping it was not the minibus my sons were in.&rdquo; Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi yesterday visited the families in Verena and told them government would assist them.Titus Simelane, the owner of Tshipnoto Funeral Home in Ekangala, has offered to bury all 20 people who lost their lives in the crash free of charge. &ldquo;This is my way of showing the families they are not alone in their pain.&rdquo;
