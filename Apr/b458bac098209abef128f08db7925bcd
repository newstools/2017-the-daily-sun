GONE are the days when the madala had to worry about his shack&rsquo;s leaking roof or threats of runaway squatter camp fires. Simon Novikela (77) was a happy man yesterday after he received the keys to his own house at Clayville near Tembisa, Ekurhuleni. Madala Simon told Daily Sun he had lived in shacks for a long time. &ldquo;Some got flooded and leaked all the time, while others burned down,&rdquo; he said. Simon used to live in the nearby Madelakufa squatter camp. He will now move into his two-bedroomed house with his wife and two children. A total of 70 houses were handed over to people in Clayville by Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Paul Mashatile.
