He said, "We are looking forward to the game and we have been preparing well for the game."We have not been doing any anything special preparations because we are playing them. We are prepared to work hard for a win and that is very important for us. We are ready for Sunday."Meanwhile, Sundowns are still struggling with an assortment of injuries to key players with the likes of Ricardo Nascimento, Soumahoro Bangaly, Wayne Arendse, Asavela Mbekile, Tiyani Mabunda, Sibusiso Vilakazi and Denis Onyango all expected to be out.The defending champions Sundowns are fourth in the league table with 38 points from 20 matches.
