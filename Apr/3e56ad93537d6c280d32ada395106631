MZANSI&rsquo;S BIGGEST union federation wants nothing to do with Msholozi.&nbsp; While Cosatu made it clear they would not leave the alliance, they also had a clear message for the president . . .&nbsp; PRESIDENT JACOB ZUMA MUST GO!&nbsp; &ldquo;Cosatu no longer believes Zuma is the right person to unite and lead the movement, the alliance and the country, and we will be communicating that decision to our ally, the ANC,&rdquo; said general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali yesterday. &ldquo;The time has arrived for him to step down.&rdquo; He said the country should be led by a new collective at government level. He said Cosatu&rsquo;s Central Executive Committee would demand that both the movement and the president explain why they were not consulted about the Cabinet reshuffe. &ldquo;For the first time, Cosatu was not consulted about the reshuffle,&rdquo; said Ntshalintshali.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have also noted that some members of the ANC top six feel there was no meaningful consultation by the president.&rdquo; He said Zuma failed to deal with some of the most incompetent ministers in his Cabinet, proving this reshuffle was not based on merit but on political loyalty. Ntshalintshali was flanked by his deputy Solly Phetoe, president Sdumo Dlamini and first deputy president Tyotyo James after the federation&rsquo;s one-day&nbsp; special CEC meeting. However, Ntshalintshali made it clear that Cosatu was still committed to the&nbsp;alliance. &ldquo;We do not support the regime change agenda that wants to topple the ANC from power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will never march with the DA and its friends. The only march led by the DA we will join is if they are marching to Cape Town to call for Helen Zille to resign.&rdquo; He called on members not to support any march to Luthuli House. &ldquo;We view that as an act of provocation.&rdquo; He called on the ANC MPs to refuse to be led by opposition parties.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cosatu also condemns those who are attempting to use school kids by calling for school boycotts in order to fight their narrow political fights.&rdquo; Ntshalintshali said they held Zuma responsible and culpable. &ldquo;It is his inattentive and negligent leadership and disruptive actions that have emboldened ratings agencies to interfere in this country&rsquo;s political affairs.&rdquo; &nbsp;Dlamini told journalists that Zuma had called him, asking for a meeting with Cosatu leaders to discuss, among other things, the union&rsquo;s call for him to step down. Dlamini said he appreciated the importance of the call, but that he had hoped Zuma would have consulted with Cosatu before announcing the reshuffle.
