RATINGS agency S&amp;P has moved to downgrade South Africa to sub-investment grade today to reflect its view that the divisions in the ANC-led government have led to changes in the executive leadership.The decision follows a Cabinet reshuffle at midnight on Friday which claimed the jobs of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.This means Mzansi must prepare to tighten its belt even more, as the cost of borrowing money for the government and for citizens is going to go up.The rand reacted immediately to trade at R13.71/$. By 5.53pm it changed hands at R13.67 to the greenback.S&amp;P said the executive changes initiated by President Jacob Zuma have put at risk fiscal and growth outcomes.&ldquo;We assess that contingent liabilities to the state are rising,&rdquo; the global ratings agency said in a statement.www.fin24.com/Economy/breaking-sp-downgrades-sa-to-junk-status-20170403
