HE&rsquo;S just a taxi conductor, but they call him The Minister . . . That&rsquo;s because passengers point fingers at him and say he looks like snappy dresser Malusi Gigaba, the minister of finance.Seneliso Nkonyeni (27) from Bonela, Durban, has been trying to explain to people that he&rsquo;s not related to the minister.&ldquo;This started last month after the Cabinet reshuffle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some passengers asked me about Gigaba&rsquo;s new position, thinking I&rsquo;m his brother.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested in politics, but I saw his picture on the internet and I realised I look like him.&ldquo;I love the man&rsquo;s style. I started following him on social networks. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m inspired to do great things.&rdquo; He said since the lookalike thing became big, he&rsquo;s found his job very interesting.&ldquo;I try to dress smartly, as Gigaba does. This is just me having fun, and passengers love me. The minister is my role model.&rdquo; Gigaba&rsquo;s spokesman, Mayihlome Tshwete, looked at Seneliso&rsquo;s photo and agreed he looked like the minister. He sent the photo to Gigaba, who is &ldquo;flattered and wishes Seneliso well in life&rdquo;.
