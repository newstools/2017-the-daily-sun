THUGS robbed the filling station for the third time in three years. Last year, security guard Sonnyboy Shilubane (38) was lucky when only his hands and feet were tied up. But when a gang of thugs opened fire yesterday, he didn&rsquo;t escape death.The incident happened at a Shell garage in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga at about 4am.Garage boss Lucky Maluleke said one of the thugs emerged from the dark on foot, carrying a 20 litre container, and confronted a petrol attendant who was busy with a customer. Lucky said: &ldquo;The next moment he ran towards a Toyota Avanza parked nearby with a guard inside. Three other suspects jumped from a silver Mercedes-Benz and started shooting at the car. They dragged the bloodied guard from the car and used him to crash through the shop doors. Once inside they blew up the cash safe but they couldn&rsquo;t get their hands on any money. They looted the tills and sped off in the Benz.&rdquo;Captain Ndlovukazi Mashele said anyone with information should contact Warrant Officer Matume Shokane on 076 927 6858 or 013 799 5511.
