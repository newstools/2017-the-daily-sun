SHE was pretty and won beauty contests, but then an insect stung her on the cheek.Now the former beauty has a bump developing on her face.Nurses at the clinic don&rsquo;t know what the problem is, but traditional healer Mahlenzi Dlamini said: &ldquo;I am telling you the woman was despised by her man. &ldquo;He printed her picture and smeared it with muthi, and then hid it in a grave.&rdquo; Speaking from her home in Simunye, Westonaria, Gauteng, the embarrassed 37-year-old woman said when the insect flew onto her face it felt like a slap.She has visited sangomas and churches for help.&ldquo;A sangoma told me a bad spirit came to make me ugly and angry with the world.&ldquo;I have consulted traditional healers as far as QwaQwa but they can&rsquo;t help me.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t attend special events because the bump makes me feel lonely and sad.&rdquo;Dlamini said she needs a sangoma who can cleanse her.
