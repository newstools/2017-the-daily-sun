BAUBA Sekhukhune was happy when he got a piece job to dig a hole for a pit toilet on Monday. But he got the shock of his life when he dug up old bones he believes are human! The 56-year-old from Makgwale Village, outside Jane Furse in Limpopo, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;As I was about to finish digging the pit for the toilet, I saw scattered small bones. &ldquo;I eventually had to stop digging because the deeper I went, the more bones I found.&rdquo; He said he believed the bones had belonged to people killed during apartheid as there were many murders back then. Bauba told the owner of the stand, Mariam Masha (48), of his horrific discovery. Mariam, who works in Joburg, said she got the stand two years ago and wanted to build a nice house for her family there. She has already built a one-roomed structure on the site, which she plans to use as a storeroom to keep building material while the main house is being built. Mariam told the SunTeam: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still shocked that bones were found on the site. I don&rsquo;t know if I should continue building the toilet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also scared more bones will be found when we start digging the foundation of the house.&rdquo; Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe advised the Masha family to report the matter to the local police station so experts can be sent to investigate.
