THE SABC is said to have been battling to pay production companies since March.In a recent twist of events, it has emerged that problems facing the public broadcaster have been piling up.It is alleged that Endemol, which produces SABC3&rsquo;s Isidingo, was not paid last month.Partial payment went to the firm that makes SABC1&rsquo;s Uzalo. And production houses that produce SABC2&rsquo;s Muvhango and 7de Laan are allegedly awaiting payment. Sunday Sun is in possession of a letter dated 31 March, in which the SABC acknowledges not paying some of the production houses on time.Signed by chief financial officer, Audrey Raphela, it reads in part: &ldquo;You will be contacted individually by your SABC counterparts to clarify how our obligation to you will be honoured by no later than the week ending of 7 April.&rdquo;Insiders claim there is no money at the SABC as former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng messed up the public corporation.An industry source said: &ldquo;We are unable to pay our workers, who include presenters, actors and people who work behind the scenes.&rdquo;Another mole said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hearing the same song from the SABC since last year. Those people can&rsquo;t keep their promises.&rdquo;Independent Producers&rsquo; Organisation (IPO) deputy chairperson Bongiwe Selane told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Payment is generally for work that has already been delivered or is in the process of being made.&ldquo;These payments go toward paying actors, directors, the technical crew, caterers, equipment suppliers and car-hire companies.&ldquo;These are the people who work 12-hour shifts to bring some of the country&rsquo;s favourite programmes to life,&rdquo; Bongiwe explained.She said failure to pay puts thousands of people&rsquo;s livelihoods, bond and loan repayments, school fees and other living expenses at stake.&ldquo;The impact on the many thousands of lives is dire. The IPO calls on the SABC to urgently convene a meeting of independent producers to explain to them when and how this failure to meet their contractual obligations will be rectified,&rdquo; she said.When asked to comment, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not engage in the public domain with the people that we work with. That&rsquo;s why we have decided to engage them directly.&rdquo;
