THE cost of petrol in Mzansi is a concern for most vehicle owners.Soshanguve Taxi Association in Block K is planning to open a petrol depot specifically for taxi drivers.Mckeed Mogale, chairman of the organisation, said taxi owners in the area met to discuss the idea.He said the purpose of the depot was to help taxi drivers save time. It will prevent them from waiting in long queues to fill their vehicles.He said taxi drivers face difficulties because petrol is costly and is sometimes finished when they arrive at filling stations. Mogale said the challenges inconvenience them because they can&rsquo;t operate without petrol.The petrol station will be for all drivers in the area and the depot will charge the going rate for petrol. &ldquo;Charging a different price in the same fuel pricing zone is illegal.&ldquo;The petrol price is regulated by government and retailers in each specific zone must comply with the law.&rdquo;He said the depot will start operating from June.Taxi driver Kgothatso Selemele said he was happy with the organisation&rsquo;s plans because waiting in long queues at filling stations held up their business. He said passengers get frustrated when drivers go to fill their vehicles.&ldquo;Hopefully this will be the beginning of many petrol depots for us.&rdquo;
