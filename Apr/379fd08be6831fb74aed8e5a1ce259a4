WE don&rsquo;t have a junk country, we have a junk President!&rdquo;This is some of what DA leader Mmusi Maimane had to say to the thousands of marchers who gathered on the lawns of the Union Buildings in Tshwane today.Maimane went on: &ldquo;We will remove junk so that South Africa can become prosperous!&rdquo;During the speeches by various leaders, the news broke that ratings agency Fitch has followed the footsteps of Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s and also downgraded South Africa to junk status.The downgrading of the country came after former finance minister Pravin Gordhan was sacked on 31 March during a Cabinet reshuffle. It is one of the reasons South Africans took to the streets to demand Zuma&rsquo;s removal as president.&nbsp; The march in Tshwane saw thousands marching from Church Square in the city centre to the Union Buildings. It was one of the bigger anti-Zuma marches and protests held around Mzansi today.Maimane told the marchers that they should remove the junk president and build a prosperous nation that they can give to future generations.&ldquo;This is the beginning of the movement of many more protests to come,&rdquo; said Maimane.Another &ldquo;National Day of Action&rdquo; is planned for Wednesday 12 April.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
