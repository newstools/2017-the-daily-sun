MARITZBURG UNITED plan to be cautious against the unpredictable Chippa United.The teams will battle it out in an Absa Premiership match at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Tuesday (7.30pm).This will be an interesting clash, considering both teams are aiming for a top eight finish.The Team of Choice, who currently occupy eighth position, have a slight advantage as they had a 10-day rest, compared to the Chilli Boys, who only rested for two days.The Port Elizabeth side were involved in the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals match against National First Division side, Jomo Cosmos, at the same venue yesterday.Maritzburg captain, Kurt Lentjies, said they will use a cautious approach to avoid making mistakes.Said Lentjies: &ldquo;Chippa are very unpredictable and dangerous at home.&ldquo;It will be a tough one. But having said that, the game will be a bit tight even though we&rsquo;ll be playing away.&rdquo;United will go to this match without Brian Onyongo and Deolin Mekoa, who will be serving their second match suspension. Evans Rusike is another player that interim coach, Fadlu Davids, will have to do without in this match.But Davids didn&rsquo;t sound worried that much with the absentees as he relied on youngster Siphelele Ndlovu against Baroka.The soft-spoken coach revealed that having the versatile Ndlovu from their MDC team really helped.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only 19 years, but his reading of the match is far better than other 30-year-olds. He&rsquo;s one of a kind,&rdquo; said Davids.
