EVERY DAY, calls for Jacob Zuma to resign as president are multiplying.&nbsp; The multi-party Freedom Movement launched yesterday has many objectives, but its primary aim is to remove Zuma.&nbsp; WE WANT TO RESTORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE, SAID PRINCE MASHELE. Political analyst Mashele, speaking at the launch of the Freedom Movement at Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Hall in Orlando, Soweto, Joburg, said: &ldquo;The movement was started to remove Zuma from office, protect the South African Constitution, restore power to the people of South Africa and protect their hard-won freedom, and to safeguard the state as an instrument of transformation.&rdquo;The launch was attended by political leaders such as the UDM&rsquo;s Bantu Holomisa and the DA&rsquo;s Mmusi Maimane, but the movement stressed that other political parties like the EFF were also on board.The movement also has the support of other civic and religious organisations. Mashele said the political mismanagement of the country had reached boiling point and was threatening the economy. &ldquo;Our country&rsquo;s rating has been downgraded to junk status, which means the cost of living for ordinary South Africans will be unbearable.&ldquo;Many more will lose jobs and food and transport costs will sky rocket.&rdquo; The launch of this movement comes just a week after a wave of marches against state capture and calls for the removal of Zuma. Maimane told the media there would be multiple events going forward to engage ordinary South Africans.He said Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota could not be at the launch as he was busy organising an event in the Free State.Holomisa said events in the country require South Africans to close ranks and stand together.&ldquo;We must swallow our pride irrespective of our political affiliation and put the country and its citizens first.&rdquo; The Movement will gather at Freedom Park, Soweto on Freedom Day next week. Mashele said the gathering had received the support of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. The movement called on all South Africans to use Freedom Day to take a stand against corruption.
