She was awarded the Best Early Childhood Development Publication 2015: Special Mention Category by the National Development Agency of South Africa for her Smelly Cats.&nbsp;Last year, she won the 5th East Wave Radio Nelson Mandela International Day Community Leadership Award Ceremony, Young Leader 2016 &ndash; for her leading motivational and inspirational roles, and Academic Achievements and Initiatives 2016 &ndash; for her writings.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what other kids are saying about my writing, all I know is I&rsquo;d like to inspire and urge them to do the same,&rdquo; she said.Although already a prolific author, Stacey said she had other big dreams such as a being a doctor when she finished school.&ldquo;I know most people would like to see me being a journalist or a full-time author, but I want to be a doctor,&rdquo; she said.She revealed to Sunday Sun that she had already written three more books that were waiting to be published.&ldquo;It seems once I start writing, my creative juices never stop flowing.
