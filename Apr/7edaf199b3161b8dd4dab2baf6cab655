AFTER one of his church members was murdered last month, Pastor Karabo Moleko vowed to make sure her killers were found. And on Monday, he became a hero to his community when he led the cops to the man he suspected. The suspect was arrested at his home in Fochville, near Carletonville in Gauteng.The victim, Puleng Tuba, was a Sunday school teacher and a full member of the church. She left home on the fourth of last month but never returned. Two days later, her body was found.Pastor Moleko told the SunTeam: &ldquo;Puleng was one of the smartest people at our church. My heart was broken when I heard she&rsquo;d been killed, so I decided to help the cops. &ldquo;I know our area very well and I had three suspects in mind. Two were written off but the last was bust after all evidence pointed to him. &ldquo;I would like to thank the community for all their help.&rdquo; Puleng&rsquo;s aunt Noma (44) said: &ldquo;I became worried when a night passed and she didn&rsquo;t return home. It was unlike her not to call us to say where she was.&rdquo; She said two days after Puleng&rsquo;s disappearance, the cops phoned the family to identify a corpse. &ldquo;When we went to the mortuary with the cops we found out the body was Puleng&rsquo;s. Her death angered the pastor, who said he would leave no stone unturned. Thanks to the pastor and cops, we have found some closure. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy a suspect was bust, although that won&rsquo;t bring Puleng back.&rdquo; The suspect is in custody and a case of murder was opened at Fochville Police Station.
