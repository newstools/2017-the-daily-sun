MANY people will be going home for the long weekend, but with rising transport costs, some plan to hitchhike. But KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele has urged residents to stop asking for lifts and motorists not to pick up strangers on highways. Mbhele said her warning comes after police noted an increase in hijacking, murder and rape cases over the public holidays. &ldquo;Thugs use the strategy of asking for a lift to hijack cars. Many victims have been robbed and hijacked at gunpoint by people they picked up on freeways. Most female victims were raped by motorists they got lifts from.&rdquo;In an incident earlier this month, a 45-year-old woman from Mtubatuba in northern KZN took a lift from a private car and was taken to the bush, where she was raped and robbed. &ldquo;The woman was going to Pongola, but the motorist drove to Mkuze, telling her he was going to a petrol station,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;On the way to the garage, he stopped near the bush, tied her to a tree with rope and raped her the whole night.&rdquo;In another incident earlier this month, a truck driver was murdered at Mfekayi Reserve in Mtubatuba. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s suspected the driver was shot by people who asked him for a lift and tried to hijack the truck,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re appealing to residents of KZN to please catch taxis at taxi ranks.&rdquo;
