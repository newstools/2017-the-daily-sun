&ldquo;HE MUST rot in jail for lying to me!&rdquo; said a mum whose lover got her 13-year-old daughter pregnant! The 37-year-old mum from KwaFelekisi near Amanzimtoti told Daily Sun she trusted her lover and never thought he would make a girlfriend of her daughter. &ldquo;She lives with her gogo nearby, but she often visited us. &ldquo;They would always have good chats and I thought he saw her as his daughter, but it turns out he was bluffing,&rdquo; said the furious mum. She said she noticed last week that her daughter could be pregnant. &ldquo;I asked her gogo to pay attention and ask her what was going on as they are very close. It came out that she&rsquo;s three- months pregnant.&rdquo; The mum said she was very disappointed in her daughter and defended the man. The girl apparently told her mum the man promised to pay damages and look after the baby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confused how my daughter could believe his lies as she knows that I have a five-year-old with him and he hasn&rsquo;t paid damages for me,&rdquo; said the mum. She opened a case against her boyfriend and he was arrested. &ldquo;He must rot in jail for the pain he has caused me and for taking advantage of my daughter.&rdquo; KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a cause of statutory rape was opened at the KwaMakhutha Police Station. &ldquo;A 34-year-old suspect was arrested and appeared in the Umbumbulu Magistrates Court on Thursday,&rdquo; she said.
