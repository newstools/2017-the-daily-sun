Jose Torrealba, who starred for both Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs, has pledged his allegiance to Amakhosi ahead of Saturday evening's league clash between the two sides.The 36-year-old Venezuelan forward, who started his career in Mzansi with a two-year spell with Sundowns before later spending three seasons at Naturena, has revealed his heart is with the Glamour Boys in what will be a crucial contest in the Premiership title race.He told the club's official website, "It&rsquo;s another huge game, probably a close second to the Soweto Derby. However, especially for me, it was an immense clash, as I had played for Sundowns."A player never wants to lose against his former side and the same was true for me. So, for me, the Chiefs and Sundowns match felt like the Soweto Derby."Thanks to all for keeping me in their minds. I will love your forever and I hope that I can visit you soon. I wish it will be good game on Saturday. I will definitely be vying for Kaizer Chiefs."
