The players, the captain, they have been truly supporting, and my family as well.&nbsp;"This I just want to dedicate it to the supporters, we haven't been getting points as much as we have wanted.&nbsp; &nbsp; "I hope this is the beginning of the victories and the way we want to play.

"I haven't been scoring goals since I came back and I always want to score goals to help the team.&nbsp; &nbsp; "We haven't been scoring goals as a team. So we have been working very hard with the coach, extra training with the strikers. I am happy I scored as it was predicted by the skipper," he added.
