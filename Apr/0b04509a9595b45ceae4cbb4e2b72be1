PHUMZILE Mcambi arrived at her uncle&rsquo;s home at KwaGwebu in Nongoma, northern KZN straight after the schools closed for the Easter holidays.The 16-year-old from Mtubatuba intended to return to her village next week, because schools open on Tuesday. But while swimming with friends near Iwela River near her uncle&rsquo;s home on Tuesday, she tragically drowned in a deep trench.Uncle Alson Mngomezulu (50) said when the girl left his house she was on her way to fetch water, carrying a bucket.&ldquo;She was accompanied by her younger cousins and when she got to the trench, there were other girls there. I heard she decided to swim when she got there and unfortunately she drowned. &ldquo;Other young girls who were there failed to save her,&rdquo; he said.Mngomezulu added that after hearing loud screams, he and neighbours rushed to the trench. &ldquo;After nearly two hours, my niece was found under the water. She was already dead and there was nothing we could do to save her life.&rdquo;Mngomezulu added that the trench had been dug years ago by residents who wanted to access underground water.&ldquo;Because we do not have tap water in this area, digging a trench on the shores of the river helps us get clean water from under the ground that we can drink. The trench gets deeper and wider when it rains and children sometimes swim there, although it is against our will. &ldquo;We had another incident where a child drowned two years ago. &ldquo;My heart is very heavy. I never expected her to swim and drown here,&rdquo; he said.KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele confirmed the incident and said an inquest docket was opened.&ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,&rdquo; she said.
