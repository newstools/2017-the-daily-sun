SOME people love to blame others for the bad situations they find themselves in. But Madodanele Cebanto (33), from Block 9 in Lower Crossroads, Cape Town hates playing the blame game. Cebanto said he dropped out of school when he was in grade four because of financial problems.Last year he decided to start a welding company called Ace Welding. &ldquo;I make burglar gates and bars.&ldquo;I realised I need to use my hands to survive because God gave me a gift, even though I am uneducated. &ldquo;I cannot afford to go to bed on an empty stomach,&rdquo; he said. The father of two said his job helps him put food on the table for his kids. The cost of his services ranges between R150 and R1 500. Madodanele made a bike with four wheels that he calls Five Circle. He uses the bike to make deliveries.&ldquo;I decided to build this bike so I could cut the cost of paying someone to deliver to my customers.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saved a lot of money since I built Five Circle.&rdquo; Madodanele said people who are forced to drop out of school should try to use their talents to provide for their loved ones. &ldquo;We all have a gift. All you need to do is find out what it is.&rdquo;
