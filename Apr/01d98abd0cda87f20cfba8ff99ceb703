THE Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality faces critical water shortages.This has prompted the municipality to tighten water restrictions and roll out programmes to educate residents on saving water.But residents have pointed out that the metro&rsquo;s plans do little to help when ageing infrastructure is wasting thousands of litres every day!Residents accused the metro of failing to fix leaks and of not responding quickly enough when pipe bursts occur. Wells Estate residents said an underground pipe that burst in 2007 has still not been repaired, pointing to a dam of water that has formed in the kasi.A river of water flows from the leak, flooding Qaqamba Street.Resident Regina Ngoqo (66) said: &ldquo;We used to complain to the municipality but later gave up because they didn&rsquo;t take us seriously. We have to close our windows and doors early, before sunset, as an army of mosquitoes comes from there. Some inconsiderate residents also keep throwing rubbish in the water. This has become a sick part of our life.&rdquo;Gogo Regina&rsquo;s house, where she lives with her five young grandchildren, is located right next to the stinking dam. She said she struggled to stop her grandkids playing in the muddy water.Another resident, David Lubisi (37), said he was planning to move to another place as soon as he got the opportunity.&ldquo;Home should be a place of comfort but instead, we fear coming home from work.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Miki said keeping the city clean and the infrastructure in good order would only be achieved by a joint effort between the municipality and communities. He said drains were often blocked because residents threw foreign objects such as tyres down stormwater drains.&ldquo;However, we will send a team to assess the affected streets in Wells Estate.&rdquo;
