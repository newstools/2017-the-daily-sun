Dear MizzBI am a 27-year-old man and I am stressed.When I was eight years old my uncle sexually abused me and sometimes had sex with me. I am filled with anger whenever I see him and I can&rsquo;t stand any physical contact with him or any other man. When I date women I am short-tempered but I do not want to lose the woman that I love and am with at the moment. How do I stop feeling so angry?&nbsp;- Young Man&nbsp;Dear Young ManSodomy and rape are the most traumatic violations any individual can face but holding onto resentment will only bind you to that person. Forgiveness does not set your uncle free but it gives you your freedom because anger imprisons you as the survivor. Do not pay for the choices that your uncle made.It is not your fault and there is nothing you did as a child which encouraged him.Please call us and speak to a counsellor.
