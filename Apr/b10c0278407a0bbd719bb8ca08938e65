SUPERSPORT&rsquo;S quest to develop rugby in townships, through the inaugural Rugby Challenge, seems to be bearing fruit as over 11 082 converged at the Wolfson Stadium in between KwaNobuhle and KwaZakhele kasis in Port Elizabeth yesterday.The interesting match of the day was between the giants Eastern Province Kings and Western Province, which ended 30-18 in WP&rsquo;s favour.But before this one earlier in the day, in a tournament dubbed&nbsp;&nbsp; #BorntoRugby, the Border Bulldogs came from behind to beat the Boland 28-25.Also in the day, Port Elizabeth&rsquo;s Harlequins beat African Bombers 45-34 in the Gold Cup qualifier where a number of tries were scored by both teams to kick off the exciting day of rugby.Back to the EP against WP, both teams went to the half time break with Kings leading 13-10 with tries from Stefan Ungerer and Siyanda Grey while the other side hit with Harlon Klaasen.So tight was the match that around the hour mark WP were leading 25-18 following additional tries from Grant Hermanus and Luke-Joseph Stringer (Province) and Jixie Molapo.It was a pulsating last 10 minutes of the match as EP did everything in their power to cover up but the WP backline stood firm denying them any space to manoeuvre through their try lines.It was such a good game that EP fans stood until the last bell went, as they hoped they would score a last minute try to level matters but it was not to be.&nbsp;On Saturday the Griquas beat Sharks 28-7 while Valke went wild 50-33 against Welwitschias, Leopards defeated Griffons 29-17 and Blue Bulls won 23-31 against Pumas.&nbsp;SunSport is official media partners to the SuperSport Rugby Challenge
