MPUMALANGA&rsquo;S most notorious thug, Douglas Mogakane, who is serving a 96-year jail term, is appealing his conviction and sentence. He not only wants magistrate Elmarie Theron, who sentenced him, to grant him leave to appeal, but is also shifting the blame for most of the 22 crimes he was convicted of onto fellow gang members. Among his crimes, Mogakane raped a 12-year-old girl while her cousin (35) watched in horror at Islington Village in 2011. He and a friend also broke into a spaza shop in Thulamahashe in the same year, and held the owner and her lover at gunpoint.They took cash and airtime vouchers, and then dragged the couple to the bush where the woman was raped while her lover had to watch. Mogakane&rsquo;s application for leave to appeal comes just a year after he began serving his sentence on a variety of charges including rape, robbery, armed robbery, hijacking, kidnapping and assault. Mokgakane was sentenced last April, after he begged Theron to sentence him as he was tired of the endless trips to court. Although he pleaded guilty, he now says he did not commit all the crimes. Magistrate Theron postponed the matter to 25 May for a decision. Mogakane remains in custody.
