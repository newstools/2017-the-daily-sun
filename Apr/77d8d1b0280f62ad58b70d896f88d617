THERE are serious problems at Orlando Pirates!And Bucs&rsquo; Swedish coach, Kjell Jonevret, did not hide the fact that they face an uphill battle when he spoke to SunSport after their morning training session at Rand Stadium in Joburg yesterday.Jonevret believes their position in the Absa Premiership table shows Bucs are struggling.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the league table lies,&rdquo; he emphasised.Pirates dropped to unfamiliar 11th spot in the table following a 3-2 defeat to Free State Stars at the weekend. The clubs meet again in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 round at the same venue on Saturday (8.15pm) The Soweto giants are edging closer to involvement in the relegation battle, seeing that only five points separate them from bottom club Baroka FC. The last time Pirates won a match was on 22 November last year when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in Port Elizabeth.Said Jonevret: &ldquo;The team is in 11th place right now and the standard of the team is at that level too. &ldquo;There are a lot of clubs that don&rsquo;t believe it until they are in this situation. A lot of teams are playing well &ndash; Stars were better than us. &ldquo;This season has been a problem for the club. But we can turn the situation into something positive and climb up the table a bit more.&rdquo;Jonevret also took the unusual step of suggesting his predecessors, Muhsin Ertugral and Augusto Palacios, may have played a role in Bucs&rsquo; downward spiral. He said: &ldquo;Many players left and maybe we haven&rsquo;t found stability. Maybe the previous coaches tried to play a type of football that we didn&rsquo;t have the players for. I don&rsquo;t know why we are where we are right now.&rdquo;Despite the setback, Jonevret insisted he is not feeling any pressure: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough for everybody who works here, but I still see an opportunity to do something positive. Hopefully we will win our next few games and not have to talk about it any more.&rdquo;Pirates defender Thabo Matlaba blamed their leaky defence: &ldquo;Things are not looking good. We have been conceding silly goals &ndash; it happened again in our last game. It has been a problem that has not been solved. &ldquo;We lost focus and they scored in the opening three minutes of the game! We are hurting more than the fans &ndash; this is our work, we get paid to play football.&ldquo;We have been trying to find solutions to ensure we don&rsquo;t concede again on Saturday. Luck is not on our side but we are doing our best for the team.&rdquo;
