LINDIWE Dlamini (39) has big dreams.She wants to become one of the most respected fashion designers in the country.The woman from Ngcongangconga in northern KZN runs a clothing business, Lindiwe Fashion Designs.When she was younger, she would turn the clothes that her mum bought her into something else.&ldquo;My mum would buy me a simple skirt, and I would tear it and change it into something different,&rdquo; Lindiwe told Daily Sun. &ldquo;At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know I had talent. I also didn&rsquo;t know anything about fashion designing. &ldquo;I only took notice after reading about a fashion designer in a magazine.&rdquo; When she matriculated in 1997, she didn&rsquo;t have money to further her studies. But that didn&rsquo;t stop her from pursuing her dream. &ldquo;In 2005, I went to Durban and befriended people who had studied fashion design,&rdquo; Lindiwe said. &ldquo;They taught me a lot about designing and clothes. In 2006, I went back home and my mum bought me a sewing-machine. That&rsquo;s when I started making clothes. &ldquo;I specialise in traditional dresses and school uniforms. I have a lot of customers in my area.&rdquo;She then asked a customer, Nelisiwe Mhlongo (35), to work for her.&ldquo;I taught her all about sewing, and since then she has not looked back,&rdquo; proud Lindiwe said. They have a good working relationship.&ldquo;My business is growing and I hope to employ more people in five years&rsquo; time,&rdquo; she said.
