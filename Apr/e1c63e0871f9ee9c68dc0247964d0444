A WANTED thug, who vowed he would not be killed by the community without taking two of them with him, was set alight by a furious crowd last week. Before the incident happened in Maniini, the victim was apparently chased from Thohoyandou, Limpopo, after fellow Zimbabweans accused him of many crimes, including a murder at a tavern last weekend. The man had been on the run for some time and fled Thohoyandou after he was spotted by residents, who formed a large group and tried to catch him. He ran to Maniini, where he barged into a house and ordered the homeowner to phone the police. After a fierce battle with the crowd, the man was dragged out of the house and beaten with weapons before being set alight. But before he was killed, he managed to stab a drunk resident, who was left with his intestines hanging out of his stomach! The ugly scene left the house he was hiding in full of blood and badly damaged. Homeowner Sharon Nedzamba said she was doing chores when the man burst in. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think twice before rushing out. The crowd wanted blood and I just stood helpless on the street as the man refused to leave my house.&rdquo;The man who was stabbed was taken to the local hospital with severe injuries. Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe confirmed the incident.&ldquo;A 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with this incident. He has been charged with murder and will appear in court soon,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.
