AJAX Cape Town midfielder Mark Mayambela is an ambitious man with a long-term vision.&nbsp;This as the footie has boldly ventured into the entertainment business.&nbsp;And according to insiders, the left-footed dribbling wizard was targeting the events and marketing sectors, through his inventive company.&nbsp;Said the source: &ldquo;Mayambela is a very smart fellow, who knows that there&rsquo;s life after a football career.&nbsp;&ldquo;Initially, he wanted to design his own fashion brand because he&rsquo;s enthusiastic about fashion. But that sadly didn&rsquo;t speak to his real passion.&nbsp;&ldquo;This guy is driven and wants to build a lasting legacy he can be proud of, both on and off the field.&rdquo;&nbsp;A second source claimed Mark was hard at work on and off the field.&nbsp;This as his &ldquo;successful&rdquo; company was set to host the Taste Of Culture event at the Rands in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, next week.&nbsp;Asked to comment, Mark told the People&rsquo;s Paper he got into the business because he saw there was a gap for his brand of creativity.&nbsp;Said Mark, affectionately known as Professor: &ldquo;As much as I live and breath football, I &rsquo;ve realised that I couldn&rsquo;t play soccer forever &ndash; regardless of my passion for the sport.&nbsp;&ldquo;I needed to be busy with other stuff on the side, so my children and I would benefit in the long run.&rdquo;&nbsp;He confirmed that the Khayelitsha event, to be hosted on 27 April, would be attended by the likes of Sjava, Amanda Black and Nolitha Lindwa, who were billed to perform among other local great musicians.&nbsp;The soccer star told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The business is all about handling corporate marketing and events.&nbsp;&ldquo;In terms of events, it&rsquo;s about lifestyle, fashion, music sessions, wine and beer-tasting in the heart of the township.&rdquo;&nbsp;
