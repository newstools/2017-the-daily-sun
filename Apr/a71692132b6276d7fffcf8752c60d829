ALLEGATIONS that more taxpayers&rsquo; money will be spent on Nkandla emerged yesterday. Although the presidency denied claims that President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s private homestead will be undergoing renovations, there were reports that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula had confirmed it. Presidential spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said: &ldquo;The presidency wishes to emphasise that there are no renovations of the private houses at the president&rsquo;s residence at Nkandla currently. No government department has indicated any proposal for renovations.&rdquo;However, Sunday Times reported that when asked whether he had been briefed about future upgrades, Mbalula said yes.Public works director Barnie Ntlou also revealed to the newspaper that processes have begun to have parts of the homestead repaired. He was quoted as saying government couldn&rsquo;t allow a presidential residence to be run-down. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said: &ldquo;We reject any upgrade to the president&rsquo;s Nkandla home, regardless of how it is described or categorised by national government. We maintain that not another cent of taxpayers&rsquo; money must be spent for the benefit of one man.&rdquo;Maimane was reacting to reports that the public works department had already started the process, which would see millions of rands being spent on repairing bad workmanship at the homestead and addressing security concerns. Maimane said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shameful that a man who has single-handedly plunged our country into junk status should live in a palace of luxury.&rdquo;Last year the Constitutional Court found that Zuma had failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution. He was ordered to pay back a portion of the money that was spent on building his Nkandla home. He paid R7,8 million after getting a loan.
