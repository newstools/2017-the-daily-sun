RESIDENTS of New Rest in Lower Crossroads, Cape Town, have been breathing filthy air for more than 15 years . . .Now the community wants something to be done about the stream of kak flowing in their neighbourhood!Nomasotsha Jubejube (54), a resident, said: &ldquo;We are forced to keep our doors and windows closed because of the smell. &ldquo;The septic tanks in the area are overflowing with human waste. &ldquo;The situation is bad because we live with our children.&rdquo;Said another resident: &ldquo;Our kids have developed rashes because of this situation.&rdquo; Councillor Mboniswa Chitha has reported the matter to the City of Cape Town. He told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The City of Cape Town should use big sewerage pipes to deal with this smelly water. No one deserves to live under these conditions.&rdquo;City of Cape Town spokesman Simon Maytham said the municipality is aware of the situation.&rdquo; &ldquo;The area is experiencing frequent sewage overflows because of blockages such as rags, rubbish and cooking oil in the sewerage system,&rdquo; said Maytham.He said residents are not allowed to throw substances that will interfere with the free flow of sewage into the sewerage system. &ldquo;Discussions are under way to try and find a solution to the situation,&rdquo; said Maytham.&ldquo;But the city will not be able to do this alone.&ldquo;Residents must abide by the law, otherwise any interventions on the city&rsquo;s part will not be a permanent solution.&rdquo;
