ON SUNDAY they prayed together at the United Apostolic Faith Church. But as Kelebogile Koenaesele (30), from Thaba Nchu left the church yard in Botshabelo, she was allegedly attacked.A church leader&rsquo;s son accused her of sleeping with his father. Kelebogile was apparently hit with a stone and tried to run away and is now recovering in the local hospital. She said on Friday she got an SMS from an unknown number. &ldquo;It said they wondered why Kelebogile prayed, but being the bitch she is, she will pay for her evil deeds. &ldquo;The son of a church leader accused me of dating his father. On Sunday when we left church, a stone hit my back and I fell down. He threw stones at my face. I don&rsquo;t know why he accused me as I am a married woman and the man is also married. &ldquo;Now I see why they chose to speak about adultery. Even the church founder spoke about women dating married men. I&rsquo;ll open a case as soon as I am discharged.&rdquo;The church elder said: &ldquo;When my son beat Kelebogile, I was not at church. I am not dating her. I help her and her family.&rdquo;Church founder Archbishop Malefatsane Ramahodi said: &ldquo;I heard about the members who fought. I spoke to the leader about the matter and when Kelebogile comes out of hospital, we will resolve it.&rdquo;
