SOUTH African wheelchair tennis ace Lucas Sithole got his SA Open campaign off to a fantastic start, with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Michael Mahlanya at the Ellis Park Tennis Stadium yesterday.Mahlanya was clearly outclassed from the start and struggled to match the power of SA&rsquo;s No 1-ranked quads player, who is looking to regain the title he last won in Joburg in 2015.While there was little resistance offered on court, Sithole was pleased to have had his first hit of the ball at the SA Open as he now looks ahead to playing compatriot Ronewa Mudzanani in today&rsquo;s semifinal.Fourth-seeded Mudzanani earlier also claimed a trouble-free win in his opening match, beating Nkosanye Nkosi 6-0, 6-0 to set up the Sithole showdown.Speaking after his match, Sithole said: &ldquo;It was just one of those matches where everything is slow &ndash; where you need to focus a lot. I was working more on my placement, especially on my serves and trying to keep my movement going.&rdquo;As for his semifinal clash with Mudzanani, he added: &ldquo;I have never played him but I watched him play at the camp last week in Soweto and he has improved, so I just need to keep my game up and kill each and every ball that hits my racquet. &ldquo;Being the top seed doesn&rsquo;t mean anything &ndash; I could lose tomorrow and go out &ndash; so the only thing I need to do is make my game more solid and then definitely I&rsquo;ll go all the way.&rdquo;Speaking about taking on Sithole for the first time, Mudzanani said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting. I&rsquo;m happy because it&rsquo;s my first time but it&rsquo;s a big challenge, so I will do my best.&rdquo;As for his chances of actually beating Sithole, the Limpopo athlete added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tennis, so I think there&rsquo;s a chance.&ldquo;If I lose, I don&rsquo;t want it to be an easy score. I want it to be tough and give him a challenge.&rdquo;
