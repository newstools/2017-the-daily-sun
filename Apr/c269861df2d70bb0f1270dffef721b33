BLACK Leopards midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase might have thrown in the towel on getting automatic promotion to the Absa Premiership, but vowed that the team would do all to collect 18 points from their remaining matches to secure a promotion play-off spot.Lidoda Duvha are currently third in the National First Division on 40 points, the same as Stellenbosch who are placed fourth and only divided by goal difference, with Leopards a match behind.They sit 10 points behind runaway leaders Thanda Royal Zulu, who only need nine points in their remaining five games to get promotion. Leopards will be hoping to close the gap and move to second position today when they visit Jomo Cosmos at Tsakane Stadium (3pm). A victory for Lidoda Duvha will see them close the gap between them and the leaders to seven points.Ntshangase said: &ldquo;We depend on other teams if we want to win the league. Finishing in the promotion play-offs is what we want. Everything is still on track.&rdquo;Ezenkosi on the other hand are in trouble having been charged by the Premier Soccer League Disciplinary Committee.
