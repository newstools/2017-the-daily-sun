POLICE have been hunting for this man for years!Luck was on his side and he always managed to be one step ahead.But the 44-year-old suspect&rsquo;s good luck ran out this weekend when cops pounced on him in Tembisa.According to the police, he was involved in hijackings and robberies in Tembisa and surrounding areas.The man targeted victims by using a stolen police card and many were duped into thinking he was a policeman.Ekurhuleni spokesman Wilfred Kgasago said they are happy with the team&rsquo;s performance.&ldquo;A man that has been on the run for some months, and suspected of several hijackings in and around Tembisa, was finally apprehended.&ldquo;The arrest took place on Friday night in the Tembisa area,&rdquo; said Kgasago.He said an efficient team was behind the arrest. &ldquo;EMPD tracing unit members missed arresting the elusive suspect by a hair&rsquo;s breadth in mid-February, when two hijacked vehicles were recovered and one of his alleged accomplices was arrested.&ldquo;The 44-year-old suspect was found with a suspected stolen SAPS member appointment card and a driving licence not in his name,&rdquo; added Kgasago.
