AFRICAN languages have been seen as less important than English and Afrikaans at academic and educational institutions in South Africa. But more academics and graduates are recognising the important role indigenous languages play in promoting all 11 official languages.This was the case during a recent graduation ceremony at the Gordon Institute of Business Science at the University of Pretoria.PhD graduate Anastacia Mamabolo proudly read her speech in Sepedi, which is one of the university&rsquo;s official languages of communication. Her mother tongue is also Sepedi.She obtained an MBA degree at the university in 2012, winning the Best Student and Best Research Report awards. Professor Nicola Kleyn, the institute&rsquo;s dean, said: &ldquo;Anastacia is a hard worker and a great achiever. She is a role model for women in the academic world.&rdquo; For Anastacia, her PhD is just the next step on her journey. She told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Being a woman means having great strength and ability. It means moving past stereotypes and expectations, embracing yourself and striving for a better future. &ldquo;I look forward to passing my knowledge on to other women.&rdquo;
