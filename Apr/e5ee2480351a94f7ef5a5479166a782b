TEBELO&rsquo;S business is growing and he believes it is because of the 34 rabbits he keeps in his yard.Tebelo Molotsi (45), from Khayelitsha, Mangaung, said his luck changed when he was given a pregnant rabbit six years ago. Only a month later he had nine little rabbits hopping around his shack. &ldquo;My rabbits bring me luck and unlike dogs, they are quiet at night.&ldquo;I have been a businessman for years but nothing was going right,&rdquo; he said.A friend gave him one of his own rabbits, which was pregnant at the time.&ldquo;I named her Selina. Shortly after she arrived, my business of selling snacks and my salon started booming. &ldquo;My rabbit family is also growing,&rdquo; he said.He lives with his wife and she doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with his little friends.&ldquo;Rabbits are clean animals. They are easy to take care of. I feed them twice a day and they eat everything I cook in my shack. I built a cage using wire and a piece of fencing just to keep them in my yard so that people who see them as a piece of meat can&rsquo;t get near them. At night they sleep under my shack in a hole they dug to keep warm.&rdquo; Tebelo said at one stage he had 200 rabbits but they took up too much space in his small yard. &ldquo;I had to sell most of them so those remaining had space to run around and play. One day I want to own a rabbit farm because they bring joy to my heart, just as babies make other people happy. &ldquo;Most black communities kill these beautiful animals to eat. But if they stopped killing them, luck would follow, as it has followed me.&rdquo;
