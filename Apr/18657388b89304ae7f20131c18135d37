AS many as 30 000 people from diverse political homes joined forces in Church Square, Pretoria today to demand that Jacob Zuma steps down as president.The Tshwane CBD was painted red and blue by dancing and singing supporters of the DA and EFF during the National Day of Action, although the red shirts were in the majority.The march started at Church Square and went on to the Union Buildings where supporters were addressed by their leaders. Speaker after speaking criticised Zuma and demanded that he step down. The president of the UDM, Bantu Holomisa coordinated the march. He said they have gathered to send a signal to the governing party. But it was the EFF&rsquo;s Julius Malema who stole the show when addressing the crowds, firing shots as Zuma and the ANC MPs.He labelled the ANC MPs as cowards, who will vote against the motion of no confidence on Zuma just to save their jobs.The vote had been scheduled for 18 April but has now been postponed.&ldquo;I worked with all of you. You are cowards, I know all of you. But don&rsquo;t worry, we are arranging it so you won&rsquo;t be exposed when we vote next time,&rdquo; said Malema.Malema was referring to a move to allow the vote of no confidence against Zuma in Parliament to be a secret vote so that people could vote with their beliefs, not with how their parties tell them to vote."When the state of South Africa is threatened, we put aside our differences, we unite for the purpose of winning back our beautiful country. When we are united, we will never be defeated by an illiterate president," he said.He thanked Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe for previously sending a message to MPs to put the interests of the people first when voting in the motion of no confidence."This office belongs to the people of South Africa and not a clan of Namalala. This is not a Nkandla compound, he must go back to the village to look after the cattle because that is the only job he can do," Malema said.He said the marchers didn&rsquo;t have a memorandum to present to the ANC or Zuma.&ldquo;The man hates books and therefore a memorandum can&rsquo;t be read by this clown occupying this office.&rdquo;He said the march was not a once-off event and that there are plans to take protest action nationwide.Zuma has lashed out at the marchers who took to the streets against him last Friday, accusing some of them of being racist based on some of their placards.&ldquo;If not wanting Zuma is racist, then we are proud racists. We don&rsquo;t care whether you are white, Indian or black, we are here to defend the future of our children,&rdquo; said Malema.He said anyone who finances a fight against corruption is a patriot.He said the ruling party is misleading the public by suggesting that the country's credit ratings downgrade has been exaggerated by white people."They are misleading you and they say this issue is an issue of white people. It is not an issue of white people alone, it is an issue that is going to hit the pockets of the poorest man in the street," he said.Malema thanked the protesters for their disciplined conduct.Among the parties that participated in the march were the DA, the EFF, the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), the African Independent Congress (AIC), the African People's Convention (APC), Agang SA, Cope and the IFP.&nbsp;
