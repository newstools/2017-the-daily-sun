PREMIER League leaders Chelsea are focused on getting results in their remaining nine games as they fight for the title, instead of dwelling on Saturday&rsquo;s 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace, manager Antonio Conte has said.The defeat was only Chelsea&rsquo;s second in 10 league games and their first home loss in the Premiership since September. The defeat has cut the Blues&rsquo; lead at the top of the table to seven points, after second-placed Tottenham Hotspur defeated Burnley 2-0.&ldquo;There are nine games to play and we have to think step by step,&rdquo; Conte said.&ldquo;At the end (of the season), if we deserve to win the title, we will be very happy.&ldquo;When you lose this type of game, in your mind you ask a lot of questions looking for solutions. But it&rsquo;s very difficult to find a reply to this result.&rdquo;Chelsea host fourth-placed Manchester City tomorrow. Their last home win against the Manchester side in the league was in 2013.&ldquo;They (Man City) have a really strong squad but I think it&rsquo;s right to think about ourselves, to go game by game,&rdquo; the Italian manager said. &ldquo;In England, every game is tough, whether the name of your opponent is City or another team.&rdquo;City drew 2-2 with sixth-placed Arsenal on Sunday and will be hoping to end their three-game winless streak at Stamford Bridge.Meanwhile, injured Stoke City striker Peter Crouch is doubtful for tonight&rsquo;s trip to Burnley, with midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri and defender Geoff Cameron also unlikely to be ready in time for the match, manager Mark Hughes has said.Crouch hurt his knee during Stoke&rsquo;s 2-0 defeat at the hands of Leicester City on Saturday, while both Shaqiri and Cameron are short of match fitness.&ldquo;We have a few bumps and bruises from the weekend,&rdquo; Hughes said.He said ninth-placed Stoke would focus on recovering in time for the trip to Burnley after a disappointing performance against Leicester, adding that his side&rsquo;s target was to finish in the top half of the table. &ndash; REUTERS
