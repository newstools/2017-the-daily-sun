AFTER he once again helped Golden Arrows progress to the semifinal of the Nedbank Cup, Nduduzo Sibiya says there is no club that can stand in their way of winning the trophy. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende beat Platinum Stars 1-0 on Saturday to book themselves a spot in the last four of Ke Yona. Nduduzo&rsquo;s assist from a corner saw Musa Bilankulu score the only goal of the match at Princess Magogo Stadium in Durban. In the previous round the 21-year-old also scored the only goal that helped Arrows see off Mamelodi Sundowns to set up a meeting with Dikwena in the quarterfinals. Said Sibiya: &ldquo;The team spirit is there and you can see everyone is working towards one goal and that is to win this cup. &ldquo;It was a hard fought win against a strong Platinum Stars, but we knew we were going to win. &ldquo;After having beaten them, Maritzburg United and Sundowns we see ourselves going the whole way. &ldquo;No one can stand in our way now.&rdquo;The skillful winger was still a development player at Arrows in 2009 when the club won its first ever silverware &ndash; the MTN8 trophy. He said since then he&rsquo;s been longing to get his hands on the trophy in Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende colours. He added: &ldquo;This is our time. Most of us here were still in the development setup when the team last won a cup competition. That includes myself. &ldquo;Now we are in the senior side and we want to win this competition.&rdquo;The right winger added that they weren&rsquo;t worried about which team they would face following the semifinal draw tonight. Head coach Clinton Larsen said his wish was to get a home draw. &ldquo;At this stage of the tournament you can&rsquo;t really choose who to play against. &ldquo;Every game is difficult now. The only thing we wish for is the home draw,&rdquo; said Larsen.
