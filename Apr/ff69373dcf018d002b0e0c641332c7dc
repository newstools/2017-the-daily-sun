Kaizer Chiefs striker Bernard Parker is optimistic that his partnership with newly-arrived Amakhosi marksman Gustavo Paez will prove a very fruitful one. Venezuela-born Paez, signed in the January transfer window, has become an increasingly influential member of the team - featuring more regularly, and getting on the score-sheet. Parker has also enjoyed a rich vein of form as Amakhosi have shot up to within one point of the summit.In Chiefs' last five matches, Parker has scored twice and Paez three times, and although the pair have not yet played too many minutes together, Parker is excited about the potential their partnership could hold."With Paez coming in, he has understood us quickly. He is very a mobile player and with his mobility and my experience, I get to spot him all the time," said the Boksburg-born marksman.Parker says the South American reminds him of previous Chiefs strikers he enjoyed a strong understanding with."He reminds me of similar strikers we had in the past like Knowledge Musona, Lehlohonolo Majoro and Kingston Nkhatha which I also spotted and assisted for them. Upfront I think our combination has grown stronger game by game and I hope it continues," Parker said. Chiefs take on SuperSport United in in a Nedbank Cup quarter-final match this Saturday. They then face Cape Town City and SuperSport in the league.
