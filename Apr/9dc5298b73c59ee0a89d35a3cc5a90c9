NEW Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba already knew on Friday that South Africa had been downgraded to junk status. Credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor announced its decision on Monday.Gigaba said he couldn&rsquo;t reveal the information because it was shared with him confidentially.He said at a press conference in Tshwane yesterday that when he walked into the office on Friday, S&amp;P had already made its decision.&ldquo;The reason I didn&rsquo;t say anything was because the agency had taken me into its confidence. I had to afford it the courtesy of not revealing the information.&rdquo; He said the downgrade was due to the recent executive changes that came with the cabinet reshuffle.Gigaba said a country only reached junk status when two of the three credit rating agencies downgraded it to that level.&ldquo;Moody&rsquo;s is still reviewing South Africa and Fitch will announce its decision soon. But the country has no reason to be unhappy.&rdquo;He said former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Jonas Mcebisi offered their help, should he need it.&ldquo;I will take their offer if needs be.&rdquo; When asked about his relation to the Guptas, Gigaba said he had met a number of business people at various places.&ldquo;But meeting somebody doesn&rsquo;t mean they have an impact on your decisions. Ultimately, I make my own decisions.&rdquo;
