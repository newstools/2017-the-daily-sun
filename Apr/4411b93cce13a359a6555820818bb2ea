TRUCKS bearing banners saying "Zuma must go" have blocked traffic on some of Cape Town's main highways, as part of nationwide protests against President Jacob Zuma today.Photographs of a few of the trucks show the vehicles in groups of three, driving next to each other, with several cars backed up behind them.City traffic spokesperson Maxime Bezuidenhout confirmed that some of the trucks had blocked the Airport Approach road, towards the N2.She confirmed that another set of trucks were being driven very slowly on the N1 incoming, after Sable Road.A third set was on Jakes Gerwel Drive, just before the N1.Traffic along these routes was moving very slowly.However, other routes, including main ones into the city centre, were free-flowing.Meanwhile, several anti-Zuma protesters had started gathering outside St George's Cathedral in the city centre.More were expected to march to, and gather outside, Parliament later today.&nbsp;Cape Town #ZumaMustFall #AntiZumaMarches #NationalShutdown pic.twitter.com/J4mS6xVWHg&mdash; Athi Mtongana (@Artii_M) April 7, 2017http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anti-zuma-truck-go-slows-block-traffic-in-cape-town-20170407
