KAIZER Chiefs look to have been handed an Absa Premiership title boost with a spirited 2-1 victory over champions Mamelodi Sundowns.Amakhosi still have more work to do and no time to waste if they are going to wrestle the league title away from the Brazilians.But their thousands of supporters, who came to the FND Stadium in their big numbers on Saturday night, have every reason to be optimistic.Sundowns have games in hand, but games in hand do not guarantee points.At the rate the Brazilians continue to drop points in the title race, their games in hand might not be enough to see them retain their league title.An own goal by Bangarly Soumahoro late into the match gave Amakhosi a big win against the African Champions.The game was destined to end in a draw after Bernard Parker cancelled a Khama Billiat strike in the first half.Sundowns are winless in four matches as Amakhosi revived their title challenge to move to a second position on the log table with 39 points from 22 games. Sundowns are fifth with 34 points from 18 matches, but they are dropping points at an alarming rate.After a two week Fifa International break, a big crowd of more than 45 000 turned out to provide an electric atmosphere at the 2010 World Cup Stadium.Amakhosi have struggled to attract a good crowed in their home matches apart from the Soweto derby, but the fans came in their big numbers to get behind their team against the defending league champions.The crowed provided some colourful scenes in the stands.After missing several games due to injury the Brazilians talisman Billiat returned for this pick of the weekend match.Billiat made his presence felt as his shot deflected off a Chiefs defender to give his side an early lead.The Zimbabwean super star was dearly missed by the Tshwane giants in the three matches that they failed to win without him in the team.But Parker leveled matters before the interval for Amakhosi.The opening half was a great advert for local football as both teams played their hearts out.It was an entertaining half that kept the excited fans on the edge of their seats.The Brazilians defeated Amakhosi 2-1 at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria in their first round meeting.
