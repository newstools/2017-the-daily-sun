PLATINUM Stars have no intention of taking their foot off the pedal in the CAF Confederation Cup.Dikwena have been drawn with MC Alger from Algeria, CS Sfaxien from Tunisia and Mbabane Swallows from Swaziland in Group B of the CAF Confederation Cup. Speaking to Platinumstars.com from Cairo where the draw was conducted, Dikwena general manager Senzo Mazingiza stated the club&rsquo;s ambitions in the CAF competition: &ldquo;We are going to give it our best. We are happy with the draw. It was conducted well. &ldquo;Our first match is at home against Alger. That&rsquo;s good because we&rsquo;re playing Maritzburg United around that time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s balanced since we have two North African teams and two from Southern African. We won&rsquo;t take Mbabane Swallows lightly. The fact that they&rsquo;ve reached this stage of the competition says a lot about them.&rdquo; Dikwena are involved in the Confed Cup and the Absa Premiership, where they are not in a desirable position. But Mazingiza said they would strike a balance to do well in both competitions. &ldquo;We are well prepared. We know that North African teams are always ahead in terms of experience in these competitions. We will give it our best. We need to be realistic. We have to do a balancing act. &ldquo;We are happy with the experience we are getting. We&rsquo;re building a new team and are excited to be at this stage of the competition,&rdquo; he said ahead of Dikwena&rsquo;s PSL clash with Ajax Cape Town at Cape Town Stadium on Sunday. Dikwena&rsquo;s first Caf Group match is at home against MC Alger on 13 May.Meanwhile, in the Champions League, Mamelodi Sundowns have been circled in Group C against Ethiopian side Saint George, AS Vita Club of Congo and Tunisian giants Esp&eacute;rance de Tunis.The Brazilians will start their group matches at home against Saint George on the weekend of 12-14 May, followed by Vita Club away on 23-24 May and Esperance on 2-4 June.
