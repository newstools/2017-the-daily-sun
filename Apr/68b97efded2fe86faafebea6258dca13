THE court battle between a young king and his prince uncle is not over yet.On Wednesday the Grahamstown High Court again postponed the matter where Thembu Prince Mthandeni Mankunku Dalindyebo is challenging Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle&rsquo;s decision to recognise Azenathi Dalindyebo as Thembu king.Azenathi, who was crowned in December last year, is jailed king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo&rsquo;s son. His uncle Mankunku has been contesting for the throne, backed by the Ngangelizwe royalty, a faction of the jailed king&rsquo;s enemies.Last year Corporate Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen set up the Tolo Commission to help the Thembu nation choose an interim leader between Azenathi and Mankunku.The commission recommended that Mankunku become the interim Thembu king, but that the final decision rested with Premier Masualle. Azenathi&rsquo;s faction disregarded this finding and crowned him as king. Earlier this year, Masualle also recognised Azenathi. Mankunku and his faction then rushed to court to challenge Masualle&rsquo;s &ldquo;wrongful recognition&rdquo;, arguing that the premier failed to consider the Tolo Commission&rsquo;s findings.On Wednesday Azenathi, one of the respondents, in a surprise move filed a counter application to set aside the Tolo Commission&rsquo;s findings. Chief Thanduxolo Mtirara, chairman of the Ngangelizwe royal family, said Azenathi was causing delays and confusion.&ldquo;He cannot as a respondent file a case against another respondent. The court gave him 10 days to rectify his application. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t understand why he is going for the Tolo Commission when the premier ruled in his favour,&rdquo; said Mtirara.
