DORCAS Vooi was shocked when she gave birth to triplets after doctors told her she was expecting twins. The 34-year-old from Graceland in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, told Daily Sun she believes the surprise is a gift from God! Dorcas went for a scan while pregnant and doctors told her she was expecting twins. &ldquo;I was shocked then, but I got an even bigger shock when I delivered triplets last week,&rdquo; she said. Dorcas said she already had two children, aged four and six. She said although she wasn&rsquo;t prepared for three kids she felt God knows better than she does. &ldquo;Things are getting more expensive every day, especially food for babies. I&rsquo;m sure God has a plan for me and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not too worried.&rdquo; Dorcas said her biggest worry is that, although she is married, her family is still living with her elderly parents and the house is rather cramped.&ldquo; There are already seven people living in the house so you can imagine how it will be with the arrival of the triplets.&rdquo; Her mum, gogo Johana Tsatsi (81), said: &ldquo;These triplets will bring poverty to my family. We didn&rsquo;t expect this. I&rsquo;m shocked and worried about who is going to feed these kids. Although I have fears, I love my grandkids and they are a blessing from God.&rdquo; Dorcas&rsquo; niece, Khanyisa Hlumelo (13), said she dreamed earlier this month that her aunt would have triplets. &ldquo;I told the family and aunty Dorcas but she didn&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo; Dorcas would greatly appreciate and welcome any help to support the three girls. She works for the government and her husband works at an old-age home.
