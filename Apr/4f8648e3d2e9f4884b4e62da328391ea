GOLDEN Arrows coach Clinton Larsen has shifted his focus to the Nedbank Cup Last 16 round where they face a limping Mamelodi Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. Larsen&rsquo;s confidence got a boost when they defeated relegation-threatened Highlands Park 2-1 at the weekend to amass more points.In fact, he said the win was a huge moral booster for the players ahead of their cup match against Sundowns. Said Larsen: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a good feeling going to a meet a team like Sundowns fresh from a win. Our main objective for these remaining games is to try and win them all. You need such fighting spirit when your next opponents are Sundowns.&rdquo;Victory for Arrows via goals from Zimbabweans Knox Mutizwa and Kudakwashi Mahachi were enough to see Arrows regain sixth place in the table.Said Larsen: &ldquo;I think Pitso (Mosimane) put it very well when he said it was time to smash and grab as far as points are concerned. This is what we did against Highlands. Now we will be playing a team fighting to get their form back.&rdquo;These are trying times for Larsen&rsquo;s team as their next assignment after Sundowns will be Bidvest Wits in the league on 11 April.
