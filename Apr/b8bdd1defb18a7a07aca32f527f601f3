&ldquo;OUR councillor is too busy for us!&rdquo; These were the words of residents of ward six in Mtubatuba, KZN, who claim Councillor Sandile Manqele is not serving them. Residents said he was always around when he was campaigning during the election but these days he was only there on weekends. One resident claimed he had gone to the councillor&rsquo;s office on a number of occasions to talk to him but he was never there.&ldquo;He works as an administrator at the local cop shop and he&rsquo;s always there. &ldquo;Whenever I go to talk to him his helpers tell me to leave a message and they&rsquo;ll pass it on. &ldquo;This is heartbreaking because we voted for him to take care of our needs and not to prioritise his career.&rdquo; Another resident said it looked like Manqele had bitten off more than he could chew. &ldquo;Leading the community takes serious dedication,&rdquo; said the resident. When the SunTeam called Manqele he denied the allegations and said haters and opposition members were spreading lies. &ldquo;Yes, I work as an administrator at the cop shop but I know how to manage my two positions well.&rdquo; Manqele said his office was always open and he had helpers who were very competent. He said his ward committee members were also very helpful. KZN Co-operative Government spokesman Msawakhe Mayisela said they were not aware of the situation but they would investigate. &ldquo;If those allegations turn out to be true, we will be disappointed because when people campaign they promise they will always be there for the people and we expect them to keep their promises.&rdquo;
