KIANGA the tortoise is never really alone!The two-headed African spurred tortoise belongs to Rony Rykoort, in Belgium, and was hatched in 2012.According to Rony, Kianga has a dominant head. The head on the left started eating days before the one on the right. And it still makes most of the decisions, such as where to go and what to eat!A scan has shown Kianga&rsquo;s spine is shaped like the letter Y, splitting into two separate spinal cords and two heads. Each head has a perfectly formed brain, but the tortoise has one set of lungs and one heart. She also has two throats leading to her stomach! Two-headed tortoises are rare and rarely healthy, but Kianga seems to be the exception.
