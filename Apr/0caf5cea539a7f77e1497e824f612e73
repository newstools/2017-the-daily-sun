MOST pupils struggle to understand maths. But if they get a little help from their parents, it could help them understand it more easily and learn it more comfortably. Through its Omo brand, the fast-moving consumer goods company Unilever wants to make parents part of the Ready for Life Schools Challenge.Brand ambassadors recently visited parents at more than 400 stokvel meetings nationwide.They were teaching children and parents about the importance of maths to help them reach their future goals and help them register for Fast Kids Maths.Brand building manager Thabani Mpanza said the campaign aims to improve the maths literacy of 200 000 pupils at 350 schools across the country. He said their interactive online learning platform also promotes child development.It may be used on mobile phones, tablets and desktop browsers.&ldquo;Parents are their children&rsquo;s first teachers.&rdquo;Mpanza explained that this partnership during the early childhood development phase is essential to enable a constructive learning outcome.He added that, as important influences in a child&rsquo;s life, parents have the ability to affect a child&rsquo;s physical, mental and emotional well-being positively.&ldquo;The programme can be better managed if parents are involved in the campaign from the beginning, to encourage children to push the boundaries of success,&rdquo; he said. Mpanza added that pupils who take part in the maths challenge stand a chance to win one of 20 bursaries worth R10 000 each.They can also win a trip to the Ready for Life Academy. &ldquo;The programme will be packed with games and fun activities.&ldquo;These are all aimed at getting pupils ready for life.Mpanza said the parents could register at www.omofastkids.co.za.
