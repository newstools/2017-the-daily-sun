Bloemfontein Celtic coach Luc Eymael has been instructed by the Premier Soccer League's Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) to return to Polokwane City, according to several reports on Tuesday.Eymael was announced as Celtic's new coach on March 10, just a day after he had quit Rise and Shine.It was believed that the Belgian had not been seeing eye to eye with City's upper management.Polokwane were unhappy at Eymael's walk-out and took him to the DRC, claiming that a contract was still in place.According to one report, the Limpopo club were asking for R2.8 million compensation for Eymael's sudden resignation.While there has been no official confirmation yet from the league, the DRC reportedly made its ruling on Tuesday afternoon and deemed that Eymael should return to his former employers.Celtic CEO Khumbulani Konco told IOL his club are looking into the possibility of an appeal."We are still studying the document and will revert back on what options to go forward with," Konco said."One of them is that we can appeal the decision taken by the DRC. I think we have seven days to appeal, but I will have to confirm with our lawyers."
