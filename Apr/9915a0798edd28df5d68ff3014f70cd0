City are third on the log with 57 points from 28 matches, 12 points behind run away leaders Chelsea.It&rsquo;s a must-win game for both teams as Arsenal are pushing for Champions League football, while City are hoping to catch up with the log leaders.City were held to a 1-1 draw by Liverpool as they dropped valuable points in their previous league game. Arsenal crushed to a 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich in their last outing. Another defeat in London will increase pressure on the embattled Wenger.Former Arsenal midfielder, Paul Merson, has predicted a City win at the Emirates.Merson says City will be too much for the struggling Gunners outfit that appears to have lost their confidence. But the former English national team junior manager also predicted a high-scoring game.Merson said: &ldquo;This is a big game. I only know one thing for sure, that it won&rsquo;t be 0-0. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Both teams will hurt the other, going forward. But I think City will hurt Arsenal on more occasions. City don&rsquo;t go anywhere and play for a draw.&ldquo;Gunners are so open and lacking in confidence, you dread to think what the score could be if City go 1-0 up early on.&rdquo;Merson is convinced Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s side will have the edge.Swansea City welcome Middlesbrough at the Liberty Stadium (2.30pm) in the first game.
