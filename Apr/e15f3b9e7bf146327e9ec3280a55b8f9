WITH the Easter weekend approaching, many people will be travelling and road accidents are likely to increase. For this reason, Pastor Enoch Phiri has taken time to pray for a peaceful Easter. On Sunday, the leader of Restoration House Church in Protea Glen, Soweto, said Easter is the time people go to church to connect with God. &ldquo;Some people take advantage of this holy weekend to break into other people&rsquo;s homes. &ldquo;For this reason we have decided to pray that God brings peace to communities and encourages people to go to church,&rdquo; he said.Pastor Enoch said he prayed for safety on the roads because many people would be travelling for business, social and religious reasons. &ldquo;People need to learn to put God first. Before they hit the road they need to pray for God&rsquo;s guidance. &ldquo;People who put God first won&rsquo;t drive drunk. &ldquo;If God is guiding them they will do the right thing, especially when travelling.&rdquo; He said the prayer meeting was important because it&rsquo;s always good to look to God and ask him for mercy. Churchgoer Joseph Ngcobo said: &ldquo;The police also attended this prayer service, as they face problems like police killings and work hard at this time to reduce crime and bring peace to communities who are celebrating.&rdquo;
