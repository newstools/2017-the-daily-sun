THE Eastern Cape government has come up with a temporary solution for Sterkspruit residents. Inspectors from the Department of Labour shut the office down on 7 April. The office was too small and a hazard to employees and citizens. Eastern Cape MEC for Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture Pemmy Majodina announced during an imbizo with the Senqu Municipality in Sterkspruit on Monday that a mobile Home Affairs office for issuing birth and death certificates would visit Sterkspruit. Majodina said the Sterkspruit office was found to be too small for processing new smart ID cards. People were forced to travel 110km to Aliwal North for services. Majodina urged community members to work with traditional leaders in addressing issues. She said the roads leading to Mlamli Hospital would be fixed following a R10 million budget allocation. Sterkspruit Home Affairs manager Lucky Motsamai said the mobile Home Affairs truck is operational. The residents will still be required to go to Aliwal North for the ID cards.
