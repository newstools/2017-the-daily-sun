Hello MizzBI am a 22-year-old woman who is frustrated with dating. I am tired of dating men, only to be cheated on. Lately I date men just for sex but I cannot be a sex slave forever. I am starting to hate men.- VivianDear VivianIn life we attract the things we desire. Once you decide what legacy you want to leave behind, it&rsquo;s easy to know the type of people you should keep in your life. When choosing a boyfriend or entering into a relationship, make your expectations clear. Also tell him what you are bringing to the relationship. This will help you understand the purpose of your union. Be careful of having casual sex as you need to avoid contracting HIV, sexually transmitted diseases or even having an unplanned pregnancy. To ensure A GOOD FUTURE, YOU HAVE TO START LIVING the RIGHT way TODAY!
