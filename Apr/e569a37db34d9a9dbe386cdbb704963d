ROGER Sikhakhane reckons nine more points would be enough for Thanda Royal Zulu to seal the National First Division (NFD) title. After sharing the spoils with Black Leopards on Wednesday, Sikhakhane is convinced that winning another three matches of the remaining six should be enough for Amabhubesi. Said Sikhakhane: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be putting pressure on my players. If we can win two and draw two, that would work for us. But to be on the safe side, getting nine points would be enough.&rdquo;The coach said if they won three matches they would get to 58 points. Leopards will have 58 points too if they win all their remaining games. He explained: &ldquo;Even if Leopards win all their matches they will have to win them by big scorelines. We are talking about four goals a match or even more for them to take us out of the top position. &ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think they can manage that &ndash; winning every remaining game and scoring many goals. The goal difference is just too big.&rdquo;The log leaders begin their quest tomorrow to collect the nine points their coach seeks. They visit their inconsistent distant neighbours Royal Eagles for a KwaZulu-Natal derby at Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg (3pm).Sikhakhane said playing against Eagles, who lost 3-1 at home to AmaZulu midweek, was never easy. &ldquo;Eagles are unpredictable. They win today and lose tomorrow.&rdquo; The coach also said his top goal-scorer, Mhlengi Cele, would be fit and ready to face Eagles. Cele was substituted against Leopards after a knock to the head. Sikhakhane&rsquo;s counterpart at Lidoda Duvha, Jean Luscuito, said he would make good use of the time available before their next match against Jomo Cosmos at Tsakane Stadium on 26 April (3pm). Said Luscuito: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for us to go home and relax after a long journey. At least we will have more than enough time to correct the errors made against Thanda. We must keep fighting.&rdquo;
