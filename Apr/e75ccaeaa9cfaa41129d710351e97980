ACORNBUSH United coach MacDonald &ldquo;Bambino&rdquo; Makhubedu is caught between a rock and a hard place ahead of his team&rsquo;s Nedbank Cup Last 16 showdown with Kaizer Chiefs. The third tier amateur side will play the biggest game of their careers at the 8 000-seater Kabokweni Stadium in Nelspruit on Sunday (3pm) and cannot wait to step onto the pitch to face their idols. But Makhubedu is in two minds ahead of the biggest game of his managerial career &ndash; should he field a weak team or a strong one against Amakhosi?The amateurs have also qualified for the national ABC Motsepe League play-offs after winning the Mpumalanga region in the 2016-17 season, which offers them the chance of playing in the National First Division (NFD). But is the coach playing mind games or is he in a genuine predicament? Makhubedu contradicted himself when addressing the media in Parktown yesterday as he contemplated what to do. He said: &ldquo;I want to give fringe players a chance. I have already told the first team players that the bigger picture is the play-offs for us. We have to win the play-offs to stand a chance to get to the NFD. &ldquo;We have two teams &ndash; one for the league and one for cup competitions.&rdquo; Makhubedu seemed conflicted as he continued: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean I will field a weak team (in the cup) &ndash; the players are motivated. The play-offs are most important, Chiefs is just one game. &ldquo;But it is the biggest game of my life too. Should I risk injuries or save the best players?&rdquo; The 34-year-old added that he was looking forward to rubbing shoulders with Chiefs coach Steve Komphela: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to shaking his hand before the game.&rdquo; Acornbush beat Cape Town City FC 1-0 to get to this stage of the competition. Komphela played down Makhubedu&rsquo;s contradictory musings as mind games: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying what he said. We will give them the respect they deserve. &ldquo;The fact that they defeated City means we must take them seriously.&rdquo; Komphela said he did not mind playing Acornbush at the smaller Kabokweni Stadium: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s their home match and we can&rsquo;t choose where we want to play as visitors.&rdquo; Komphela promised to put forward a full strength team: &ldquo;Our game model is close to how we would like to see Chiefs play. We can play in all phases, defence and attack. &ldquo;We have been working a lot on the players&rsquo; mindset because everything starts with the brain. &ldquo;If we think positive thoughts we play the game the right way.&rdquo;
