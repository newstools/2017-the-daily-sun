WHEELCHAIR tennis ace Evans Maripa is hoping to continue his good run when the SA Open starts next week. International players will descend on Ellis Park Tennis Stadium from 10-14 April aiming to claim top honours. Maripa, who has already played in two single finals and three doubles finals this year, said it&rsquo;s his aim to get to the semifinal of the competition. Last year he bombed out of the first round, losing to world No 1 Stephane Houdet of France. The 14th ranked Maripa said recent competitions had given him confidence that he would do better at this year&rsquo;s tournament. Said Maripa: &ldquo;I started the year much better than other years and things are looking good. I am happy with my performance so far, it can only get better. I don&rsquo;t want to say I&rsquo;m confident &ndash; you can physically seem to be confident but if you are not mentally strong or prepared, then confidence won&rsquo;t do anything for you. &ldquo;My goal is to get to the semifinal, the final would be a bonus.&rdquo;However, he realises it won&rsquo;t be an easy feat with all the players looking to collect points and move up the world rankings. He said: &ldquo;It will be another level of competition. We have the top 10 players coming and we all need the points. It will be a challenging tour. I need to be healthy and mentally strong. &ldquo;It will be interesting week for me, Kgothatso (Montjane) and Lucas (Sithole). We have to make our home ground advantage count.&rdquo;Maripa said he would have to be wary of lower ranked players as they could cause an upset. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horrible feeling when it happens and it happens to the best of us. Even Rafa (Rafael Nadal) and Roger (Federer) get beaten by players ranked lower. You have to respect opponents but should not fear them,&rdquo; he said.
