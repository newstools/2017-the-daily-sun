Maritzburg United have themselves to blame for their 2-0 loss to Orlando Pirates on Tuesday, according to caretaker coach Fadlu Davids.The Team of Choice headed to Orlando Stadium hoping to do the double over the Buccaneers, but ended up returning to the KZN Midlands empty handed."I think we have ourselves to blame," former club captain Davids said after the game."In the first half, we unlocked them three, four, five times, but if you don't score goals - you concede a soft goal like you did and then you can only blame yourself."We should have been four goals up with the chances we created. We unlocked them tactically and credit must go to their players."Despite the defeat, United remain in the top half of the league, a single point ahead of the Buccaneers.
