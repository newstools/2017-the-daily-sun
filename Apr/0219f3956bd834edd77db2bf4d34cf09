WENDY &ldquo;Fohloza&rdquo; Tobi has swapped her kwaito microphone for church. The 38-year-old former backup singer was ordained as a pastor of Ebenezer Worship Centre at a ceremony held at Babs Madlakane Hall in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage on Friday night.The emotional ceremony was led by Wendy&rsquo;s spiritual father, Apostle Godfrey Nolands. The hall echoed as dozens of bishops and pastors prayed over Wendy in tongues for almost 30 minutes.The singer, who still feels comfortable being called Fohloza, was dressed in a green robe with a white collar.She was one of three sisters who worked with artists like Mdu, Trompies and Brenda Fassie more than 15 years ago.She told Daily Sun she had accepted her calling and will not look back.&ldquo;The gifts I have been blessed with are healing and prophecy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to preach to people who don&rsquo;t know the door of the church.&rdquo; Wendy was raised in the Methodist Church but spent most of her life at Assemblies of God.
