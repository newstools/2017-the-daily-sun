THE family still has unanswered questions, although two people have been sentenced for killing their brother Vusi Ntombela.Ntombela, who was a teacher at Luvisi Primary School and the speaker of Nquthu Municipality, was killed in front of pupils in June 2015.His family believes justice has not been served.This was revealed after the Madadeni High Court sentenced Mbhekiseni Khambule (40) on Thursday. He is the former bodyguard of ex-mayor Emily Molefe.Khambule was given a life sentence for the murder. He was also given 15 years for killing pupil Elizabeth Nhleko (12) and five years for attempting to kill Bongumusa Cele (12), who was hit by bullets when Ntombela was shot. Khambule and the gunman, Sibongiseni Mdakane (34), were arrested shortly after Ntombela was killed.Mdakane pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years for Ntombela&rsquo;s murder, 18 years for Nhleko&rsquo;s murder and five years for the attempted murder of Cele. Mdakane turned state witness and told the court Khambule promised him R15 000 if he killed Ntombela.Ntombela&rsquo;s brother, Simphiwe Ntombela (47), said his family was hoping Khambule would reveal in court who asked him to organise the murder.
