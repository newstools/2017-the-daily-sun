METERED taxi drivers have officially declared war on their competitor, Uber. They took to the streets yesterday and said they were claiming their industry back from Uber drivers. This comes after clashes between metered taxis drivers and Uber drivers were reported on Saturday and Sunday in Sandton, Joburg. Gauteng metered taxi representative Andre Zello said they had tolerated Uber too long. &ldquo;We have been tolerating these blood-sucking animals called Uber for a while now and it is time to put this to an end,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On a number of occasions, metered taxis have been impounded and issued with ridiculous fines for expired permits or lack of permits, yet Uber has been permitted to operate without permits.&rdquo;Reuben Mzayiya of the Meter Taxi Association said they wanted to dominate the market again. &ldquo;This is the beginning of metered taxi drivers reclaiming their territory and their business.&rdquo; The police have been monitoring the tense situation across Gauteng. Provincial head of visible policing Brigadier Calvin Joseph said: &ldquo;All units have been sent to the area to ensure stability.&rdquo; JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said police visibility had been increased. &ldquo;Officials were sent to some areas where violence could be predicted, but we cannot confirm any impounding of taxis or Uber cars during the operation.&rdquo;
