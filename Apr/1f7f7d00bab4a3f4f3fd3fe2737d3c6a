ANDANI Thovhakale (21) had heard about people being killed in ritual murders.But he never thought he ran the risk of becoming a victim until last week. Andani from Maniini outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo said he visited friends in Muledane, just a short walk away across the road on Saturday.But on his way home that evening, as he was crossing the road, a bakkie pulled up with three men in the front and five at the back.&ldquo;They were carrying knives. And instead of giving me a lift home, they took me in the direction of Tswinga,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I got the fright of my life when I overheard them whispering to one another, saying they were going to cut off my balls.&rdquo;That&rsquo;s when Andani threw himself out of the speeding bakkie. &ldquo;I imagined myself being cut up alive and decided it was better to die on the road than be cut up piece by piece while still alive.&rdquo;Despite his open wounds, Andani said he ran to his village and a neighbour helped him to call the police. The police took him to the hospital.&ldquo;I want to warn others about the dangers of walking alone at night,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;There are evil people out there waiting to grab whatever victims they come across.&rdquo;He said he did not open a case as he could not recognise any of his attackers. Vhembe is known for ritual murders, with 2006 being the worst year.Captain Ndidzulafhi Nelufule, a Limpopo police spokesman, said the man is still free to open a case at his local police station. &ldquo;There is no such thing as an old crime, a case can be opened at any given time.&rdquo;
