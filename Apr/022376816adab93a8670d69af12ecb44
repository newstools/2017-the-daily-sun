BOXING promoter, Lebo Mahoko, says he considers taking his fighter Nkululeko &ldquo;The Bulldog&rdquo; Mhlongo to campaign with other world sanctioning bodies after the World Boxing Federations (WBF) Executive Committee turned their appeal down.The Free State-based promoter has launched a complaint with the WBF after Mhlongo suffered a six round controversial defeat against Rafael Bejaran at the Gross Freiheit 36 in Hamburg, Germany three weeks ago.Mhlongo&rsquo;s camp wants the WBF to order a rematch with Berajan before he could be approved for any other defence.But the WBF Executive Committee turned down their appeal, saying the charges levelled by Mhlongo&rsquo;s camp are unsubstantiated. The KZN-born fighter who holds SA and WBF intercontinental belts was challenging for the vacant WBF world junior middleweight title against Bejaran from the Dominican Republic native based in Germany. The contest was stopped after sixth round due to a bad cut over Berajan&rsquo;s left eye in the second round from an accidental clash of heads. The Dream Team boss believes that it was serious injustice for not giving rematch after the controversial decision.&ldquo;It was really a serious injustice for our appeal to be turned down and I&rsquo;m considering Mhlongo to campaign on other credible sanctioning boxing bodies. For now I cannot mention names as we are still on with negotiations,&rdquo; said Mahoko.Mahoko said: &ldquo;To be honest, we&rsquo;re unhappy with the decision as they didn&rsquo;t do a proper investigation. They used edited footage that is why they came to that ruling.&rdquo;WBF president Howard Goldberg said: confirmed that the executive committee had turned down the appeal but promised to give the South African fighter another world title shot. &ldquo;The decision was technically correct, after the clash of heads from four rounds we go to judges score cards. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that Mhlongo was behind on points. I&rsquo;ll make sure he gets another title shot before the end of the year.&rdquo; Goldberg said he will challenge on super welterweight and the fight is expected to take place here in South Africa.
