THE two men were watching a soccer match when a car stopped nearby and bullets started flying. They were shot dead at a soccer field in Westbury, Joburg, yesterday morning.Angry residents claimed the incident was drug related, and cops were not doing anything to help. &ldquo;What is happening in the area is sad,&rdquo; said resident Craig Armstrong. &ldquo;We live in fear because of these gangs. The cops are working with these thugs.&rdquo;He said police knew who was responsible for the shootings.&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t arrest the thugs because they get bribes from them.&rdquo; Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said there&rsquo;s an ongoing investigation into the shooting.&ldquo;Police are looking at the possibility of gang violence, which may be related to drug trafficking,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The cops are continuing to arrest suspects but it is suspected that the druglords don&rsquo;t live in the area. &ldquo;They use people from the community, who eventually become their victims. &ldquo;In the past week, three people were fatally shot and murder cases are being investigated. &ldquo;No one has been arrested, even though police are following several leads. &ldquo;We are also talking to the people, especially the community policing forums, to try and establish the root cause of the problem.&rdquo;The cops are appealing to anyone with information about the shooting incident to come forward.
