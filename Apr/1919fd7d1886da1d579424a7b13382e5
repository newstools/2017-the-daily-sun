TWO policewomen were arrested in Polokwane on Tuesday for allegedly asking a woman for a bribe. The suspects apparently demanded R2 000 from the undocumented foreigner, who had given them some cash. Both suspects, as well as their alleged victim, are women.The woman apparently promised that her husband would deposit the money and settle the balance, but the police were informed. The cops were arrested by the Hawks at the Mall of the North just after getting the money they had allegedly demanded from the woman.Limpopo Hawks spokesman Captain Matimba Maluleke said when the cops demanded the money, the woman told her husband, who alerted the police. &ldquo;The husband then deposited the money and after they had the money, the Hawks arrested them. Maluleke said they cannot tolerate corrupt officials in service who do not do the country justice. &ldquo;We want to send a clear message to government officials who continue corrupt activities that their day will come. We are going to arrest them and ensure we are left with only law-abiding officials. We will not stop until we squeeze crime to zero. &ldquo;The two officers will be appearing in Seshego Magistrates Court on charges of corruption soon.&rdquo;
