Thando let them down by double-booking herself to another event on the same date.&rdquo;The source claimed: &ldquo;No one knows why Skhumba missed the event. He was unavailable on his phone. Organisers tried to get hold of him, but to no avail.&rdquo;Said the source: &ldquo;Organisers asked Thando for a refund, since she had failed to pitch for the event. And she later paid back the money.&rdquo;The source also alleged that organisers were fuming when Skhumba also failed to pitch.&ldquo;They had to come up with a plan. It was clear they weren&rsquo;t going to make it.&rdquo;But event organiser, Julius Mekwa, denied the two failed to pitch and were replaced.He said: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t agree on terms with Skhumba and it happened that Thando was flying out of the country.&rdquo;Mashabela Galane replaced Skhumba, with Dineo Moeketsi as co-host.Dineo said: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t informed of that. I was approached on time to host. I don&rsquo;t know anything about being the replacement.&rdquo;Thando, Skhumba and Mashabela were not available for comment
