Thulani Hlatshwayo and Daine Klate are injury doubts for Bidvest Wits' CAF Confederation Cup first leg, play-off round match against Smouha on Saturday.The game at the Bidvest Stadium is set for a 3pm kick off.The Students began their continental adventure for 2017 in the CAF Champions League, but were demoted to the Confederation Cup after being edged out by Egyptian giants Al Ahly over two legs.And while the Johannesburg side are still very much in the mix to challenge for league honours (they are only a point behind log leaders Cape Town City), they were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup by second tier side Jomo Cosmos on Tuesday night.Having fielded a largely second string side in the Cosmos stalemate, head coach Gavin Hunt will likely change his line-up considerably and may decide to give a start to Phakamani Mahlambi, after he came off the bench to good effect midweek."It's just that final ball that we couldn't get in there but we had to be a little bit better, more crafty, more inventive with our inter-playing."Phaka (Mahlambi) did great, he goes past the first man and then he's got to pass it, but he did great and changed the game for us in the second half," said Hunt.Smouha meanwhile approach Saturday's encounter on the back of a morale-boosting 2-0 league win over Zamalek last week, while in the previous round of the Confederation Cup, they got the better of &nbsp;Kenyan side Ulinzi Stars with a 4-3 aggregate victory.The Egyptian club, currently in fifth place on the Egyptian league standings, have never won the domestic league title, while this is their second time playing in Africa, having reached the group phase of the 2015 Champions League.&nbsp;
