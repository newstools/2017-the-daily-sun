UNEMPLOYED Celumusa Mabizela (36) needs to get up early in the morning to go and look for a job. But for the past four months, he has been sleeping late &ndash; he is too tired to get up.And it&rsquo;s all because a kota-eating tokoloshe with bad manners is keeping him awake!Celumusa, from Orange Farm extension 2 in the Vaal, told Daily Sun the tokoloshe sits in the corner next to his wardrobe eating a kota. It chews so loudly that he cannot sleep.He said the tokoloshe has big, scary eyes.&ldquo;It wears nothing. It chews and smiles at me &ndash; looking directly at me with its big eyes.&ldquo;Sometimes the tokoloshe comes when I am hungry. The kota smells so good, I sometimes wish I could ask for a bite!&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid the kota could do bad things to me if I eat it,&rdquo; said the father of two.Celumusa said the tokoloshe didn&rsquo;t visit him every night, but that he was tired of it and needed urgent help.&ldquo;A sangoma once gave me muthi to sprinkle in my room. The creature stayed away for a week, but soon returned.&rdquo; Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said the tokoloshe was sent by evil people who didn&rsquo;t want Celumusa to do anything with his life.&ldquo;They want him to do nothing but stay at home without work for the rest of his life. He needs a powerful sangoma to cleanse him properly.&rdquo;
