IT WAS meant to be a peaceful drive back home after a visit to a relative. But the road trip turned into a nightmare when the Ngobeni family were ambushed by five unknown men on Buitekant Street in Soshanguve on Friday evening.Sydwell Ngobeni (33) said he was driving with his father, Joseph Ngobeni (59) and son, Kutlwano Nkgatho (14) at about 7pm.&ldquo;A white bakkie overtook me and stopped in front of my car. Five men jumped out and surrounded my car, demanding I open the doors,&rdquo; Sydwell said. &ldquo;I reversed, made a U-turn and fled. I thought they were going to hijack me and I feared for the life of my father and son.&rdquo;He was surprised to see three police vehicles chasing him.&ldquo;I did not stop because I was not sure if they were real cops, but I was forced to stop when they fired at my car, hitting my father and son. They accused me of having stolen the car and refusing to stop,&rdquo; Sydwell said.&ldquo;The bullet nearly killed my son as it was lodged close to his heart.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Captain Zanele Mtsweni said attempted murder cases had been opened against two police officers.
