MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane says she has been left devastated by the brutal killing of five-year-old Tinyiko Mongwe.&nbsp; The Gauteng Community safety MEC said she didn&rsquo;t expect humans to behave like the 21-year-old who is accused of stabbing the little boy while he was playing soccer with friends in Orlando East, Soweto, on Monday. The suspect is also accused of drinking the boy&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; She said people shouldn&rsquo;t act like animals and then expect to be treated normally.&nbsp; The suspect was scheduled to appear in the Orlando East Magistrates Court on Tuesday, but he couldn&rsquo;t go as he was receiving medical attention.&nbsp; Nkosi-Malobane said it was tragic that an innocent child had been robbed of his chance to live.&nbsp; Speaking during a visit to Orlando East this week, she said: &ldquo;The purpose of our visit was to communicate our heartfelt condolences but also to assess if there is any assistance the family might need from us.&nbsp; &ldquo;We established there are Good Samaritans who have offered to help with the burial of the boy. As far as we know, the burial and tombstone have been covered. We will add on whatever is needed.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said the government was taking security in the area very seriously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a briefing with the police and they understand their mandate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The issue of visible policing is key.&nbsp; &ldquo;An hour should not pass on the streets without a police vehicle being seen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The MEC said for the protection of the suspect, her office would be opposing bail.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have since organised counselling for the family of the child and the other children who witnessed this horrible crime.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mum almost suffered a stroke after the gruesome incident and as a mother, I can only imagine what she&rsquo;s going through.&rdquo;
