GOODWILL Ngwenya (61) is fuming.He said he&rsquo;s fed up with his neighbours in Honeydew stealing his family&rsquo;s clothes from the washing-line.&ldquo;At this rate we will be left with no clothes soon. Every time I hang my clothes on the line they vanish. This happens on a regular basis,&rdquo; the frustrated father and madala told Daily Sun.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried changing the location where I hang my clothes but nothing seems to work. It&rsquo;s as if they&rsquo;re targeting me specifically. &ldquo;My children and grandchildren&rsquo;s clothes keep vanishing. We are now left with only a few items of clothing each. &ldquo;To make things worse they broke into my shack on Tuesday and stole my clothes and belongings.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if they are just jealous of me or hate me in this neighbourhood. I no longer feel safe here. &ldquo;My clothes keep disappearing but no one in the community sees a thing.&rdquo;Neighbour Alfred Mofokeng said he knew about Goodwill&rsquo;s problem. &ldquo;But we are not the ones stealing his clothes. The people who steal his washing specifically target him. We also leave our clothes on the line but nothing happens to them.&rdquo;Captain Balan Muthan, Honeydew police spokesman, said a case of theft was opened and police were still investigating.
