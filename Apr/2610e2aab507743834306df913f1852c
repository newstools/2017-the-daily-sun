#NationalDayofAction marchers paid no attention to the pouring rain as they gathered in their numbers this morning at Church Square in Tshwane.Cope leader, Mosioua Lekota said: &ldquo;The people of South Africa are not made of sugar or salt, so they won&rsquo;t melt.&ldquo;I think that the issues that they are thinking about are of such importance, I don&rsquo;t think they will walk away.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this campaign before and I&rsquo;m still here.&rdquo;He said that experience has taught him that nothing will get in the way of people when they are determined enough.Meanwhile people sang and danced in the rain as the DJ switched between house music and struggle songs.Cops are also out in force to ensure the march remains peaceful. Songs and dance continues at Church Square ahead of the march. #NationalDayofAction @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/E4ZaU2cJVQ&mdash; Christopher Moagi (@ChrisMCMoagi) April 12, 2017 While they're going sing "Happy Birthday" for Zuma in Kliptown, this is what's happening at Church Square. #NationalDayofAction @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/Jx3AGX3mUd&mdash; Christopher Moagi (@ChrisMCMoagi) April 12, 2017 Parties unite for the removal of Zuma as President. #OppositionMarch @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/SzXs0zuZWF&mdash; Christopher Moagi (@ChrisMCMoagi) April 12, 2017Song and dance as marchers continue to fill up Tshwane Church Square. #OppositionMarch @dailysunsa pic.twitter.com/7pF4BT8Pli&mdash; Christopher Moagi (@ChrisMCMoagi) April 12, 2017 &nbsp;
