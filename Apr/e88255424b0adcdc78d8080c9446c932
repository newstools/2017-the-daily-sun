MINISTER of Police Fikile Mbalula has allegedly recommended that people download the Touch HD and Cliff Central apps. News24 reported that he made the suggestion at a briefing in Tshwane yesterday to tell the media of his plans for his first 100 days in office. However, the minister later tweeted to the news website that he had only given the app as an example. He said he planned to launch an app for members of the public to report crime. His comments came after it was reported on Monday that court papers revealed North West businessman Wandile Bozwana had instructed a Bloemfontein law firm to pay Tbabo &ldquo;Tbo Touch&rdquo; Molefe R1 million, which was earmarked for Mbalula. News24 claimed a reliable source said the payment was made shortly before Mbalula and Tbo Touch left for a controversial trip to Las Vegas in the US to attend a boxing match between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in May 2015. Bozwana was gunned down in Tshwane in October 2015.When Mbalula&rsquo;s spokesman Esethu Hasane was asked about the allegations, he said News24 was making unfounded accusations. Speaking yesterday about the app he planned to launch, Mbalula said: &ldquo;People should download that app and it will also help to show how many police stations are in your area. It will be useful.&rdquo;He said crime had taken over South Africa and President Jacob Zuma had told him to deal with all sorts of crime.
