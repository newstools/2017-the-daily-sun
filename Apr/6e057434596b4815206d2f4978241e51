THE sun was hot as two sad gogos sat on chairs wearing masks at the quiet graveyard yesterday. They were about to witness one of the saddest moments of their lives, the exhumation of madala Edward Lucas. One by one, pieces of the coffin were removed from the grave at Matanzima Cemetery in KwaNobuhle kasi in Uitenhage, as tears streamed down the gogos&rsquo; faces. The 85-year-old was reburied with dignity after his disgraceful funeral over the weekend, during which the coffin cracked and his body fell into the grave. Edward&rsquo;s wife Nonyameko Lucas (65) and his daughter Nomakhosazana Makeleni (57) clinged to each other as they watched workers opening the grave. Gogo Nonyameko said: &ldquo;My husband will finally rest in peace as the funeral parlour has reburied him with a new coffin provided free of charge. &ldquo;This was the saddest moment of my life, but I thank Ponana Tini Funeral Directors for keeping their promise. &ldquo;We also thank Daily Sun for being by our side and helping us make sure that my husband was buried with dignity.&rdquo; Themba Tini of the funeral parlour said: &ldquo;This has never happened before. We thank the family for understanding. It was due to negligence by some of our staff.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the funeral parlour followed necessary procedure.
