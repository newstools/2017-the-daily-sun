COPS are looking for a Ben 10 who allegedly killed his lover with an axe yesterday morning. Nobengazi Matshoba (50) was found dead in front of her new RDP in Missionvale kasi, Port Elizabeth, at 5.40am. According to her family, Nobengazi met the Ben 10 &ndash; who is believed to be about 40 and from New Brighton &ndash; three years ago while he was living in a backyard shack in her yard. Nobengazi&rsquo;s daughter Ntombizandile (20) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My mum and her boyfriend had been fighting for the whole week because she had dumped him and told him to leave her property. &ldquo;Yesterday morning we were woken by residents who saw her body outside.&ldquo;We found our mum lying in a pool of blood near the gate. She had deep wounds on the back of her body and the axe was lodged in her head.&rdquo; Nobengazi left behind six kids, aged between eight and 35, and three grandkids. It&rsquo;s alleged the Ben 10 phoned her daughter and her employer to tell them what he had done. Ntombizandile said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all unemployed and she was supporting us with the money she earned as a domestic worker.&ldquo;She was a good mum. We never condemned her affair, even though her boyfriend smoked drugs. &ldquo;This evil man ran away with her bag, containing her money and cellphone. &ldquo;He called us from her cellphone and told us to forgive him. He also phoned her employer to say she wouldn&rsquo;t be at work.&rdquo; Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said a murder case was opened but no arrest had been made.
