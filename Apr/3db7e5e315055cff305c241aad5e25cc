Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, madala Elious Hanabe (63) said he had been forced to sleep next to his three dogs and all his belongings the night before. &ldquo;The municipal officials told me to demolish my shack and dropped my girlfriend and I off next to a toilet. They said they could not load all my belongings on the truck. They said one trip, one family.&ldquo;I ended up sleeping next to my belongings that were left in an open field in Taliban, next to my three dogs.&rdquo;Gogo Ntombizodwa Gukana (65) said she has been living in a backyard shack for more than 15 years.&ldquo;This relocation is painful because we have no budget to pay people to build us new shacks. We were expecting to get RDPs but we have been dumped next to toilets and we have to build our new shacks on our own.&rdquo; Zoliswa Bayeni (40) said she had left a four-roomed shack for nothing.&ldquo;I have been waiting too long for an RDP but we will make a plan because we have been living in shacks for years,&rdquo; she said.Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;The councillors of their wards were informed of the relocation.&ldquo;There are budgets involved so we must work together in this process of relocation. RDPs will be built in Gunguluza as part of phase one in area 1.&rdquo;
