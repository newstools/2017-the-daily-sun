KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela claims that Amakhosi&rsquo;s hopes of winning the Absa Premiership title are no longer in their own hands.Komphela made this statement after his charges were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals by SuperSport United following a 5-3 defeat on penalties at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. The sides ended 1-1 after extra time. The outspoken mentor seems to be playing mind games, with his charges one point behind leaders Cape Town City who they meet in their next league game at Cape Town Stadium tomorrow (7.30pm). Amakhosi are tied with second placed Bidvest Wits on 45 points from 24 matches, but the Students have two games in hand. The league is Komphela&rsquo;s last chance to win his first trophy since he joined Chiefs before the start of last season.Said Komphela: &ldquo;The sad part is that we still have to depend on other teams dropping points. &ldquo;The Nedbank Cup was better because once you win you can go on, you don&rsquo;t depend on somebody&rsquo;s results. &ldquo;We will have to change focus and, unfortunately, hope somebody drops points. We have no margin for error. We have to win our remaining matches.&rdquo;Komphela is aware it won&rsquo;t be easy to overcome Eric Tinkler&rsquo;s City who have had a fairytale run. To make matters worse, Chiefs might play without their influential keeper Itumeleng Khune who got injured while trying to save Mandla Masango&rsquo;s penalty kick.&ldquo;City are lethal on transition and we know what they&rsquo;re all about. They can come straight at you. We shouldn&rsquo;t play into their hands. &ldquo;It will be a challenge, but we need to focus and fix our mistakes. &ldquo;Itu fell bad, has a bruise and the medical team will assess the injury before we make a decision whether he will play or not. &rdquo;Komphela is disappointed that his charges lost Ke Yona on penalties.Said Komphela: &ldquo;We came into this match knowing our fate was in our hands, but unfortunately the result didn&rsquo;t favour us. Whatever we did counted for nothing. &ldquo;As much as it was a lottery (penalties), we lost it. It&rsquo;s just disappointing that we had to go out in this manner.&rdquo;
