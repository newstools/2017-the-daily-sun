WAR TALK is usually reserved for derbies, but this weekend&rsquo;s match between Chiefs and Cape Town City FC is building up to be a clash of note. The Cape Town side has had a fairytale run in the Premier League, but many pundits are wondering whether the wounded Chiefs will vent their Nedbank Cup frustrations on the Citizens following Amakhosi&rsquo;s shock exit at the weekend. The two top Absa Premiership teams vie for three points at the Cape Town Stadium at 7.30pm tonight.The clash has all the elements of a &ldquo;war&rdquo;, with City determined to retain their position at the top of the table, while Chiefs want to keep out of Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; reach who are gradually closing down the gap.The top of the table clash will act as a barometer to gauge City&rsquo;s readiness for the championship and it should also give glimpses of Amakhosi&rsquo;s seriousness in fighting for the title.All eyes will again be on Citizens captain and top scorer with 12 goals, Lebogang Manyama, while Lehlohonolo Majoro and Bhongolethu Jayiya with six goals each, as well as Aubrey Ngoma and Judas Moseamedi can be nuisances if left unattended.Jayiya told SunSport yesterday they were aware of the challenges ahead against Chiefs, but that their goal was to suck three points out of the Naturena side tonight &ldquo;and nothing else&rdquo;. He said the team wasn&rsquo;t talking about the league title as yet: &ldquo;We are focused on one thing at a time. &ldquo;We know Chiefs are going to come at us guns blazing, but our eyes are glued on victory.&rdquo;Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is also under pressure as he knows Amakhosi fans will start losing faith in him again if he doesn&rsquo;t deliver the league title at the end of the season.Their Nedbank Cup exit was painful for fans and they need to be consoled with a win against City and maybe move a notch up in the points table.Technically Amakhosi are still unbeaten in a number of league matches &ndash; a fact that can act as morale booster for the Naturena lads.Meanwhile striker Luyolo Nomandela has left City.
