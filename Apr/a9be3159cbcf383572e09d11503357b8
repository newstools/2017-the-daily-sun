WHAT would a race be without the endearing people of the area where it takes place?This question was not difficult to answer as I tackled my first Two Oceans marathon this past Easter Saturday. Whether we were running through Muizenberg or Imizamo Yethu, Capetonians from all walks of life were there to cheer us on. There are runners, some older than 50 or 60 years old, who have been running the ultra-marathon for years. One of them is Peter Taylor, who runs barefoot and has just completed his 30th Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon.Running this ultra-marathon, 56km to be exact, is not easy but it&rsquo;s possible to finish within the cut-off time of seven hours, I&rsquo;ve discovered. After the early start on Main Road in Rondebosch, my legs carried me all the way until we reached Chapman&rsquo;s Peak, which is 26km away and a little more than 2km shy of the halfway mark.While taking in the beautiful views Chapman Peak offers, the sub 6:30 bus I was with pulled ahead of me. Towards the end of this stretch, I got on the sub 7:00 bus, which also left me as we approached the viciously challenging twists and turns of Constantia Nek. I walked throughout this ascent &ndash; and it was then that a fellow-runner told me we had been running for 5 hours and 40 minutes already. That was a confidence booster at the right time as I have been avoiding looking at the time. It was here that I forced my aching legs to carry me. The determination was there like never before that I could finish the race in time and get the much-vaunted medal. Unmistakably, Cape Town is a world class city. And there is no doubt that this is indeed &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most beautiful marathon&rdquo;. Along the tough course, you get to interact with fellow-runners from the African continent and international runners from countries like Brazil and Italy. In the end, I finished the race in a time of 06:57:48 &ndash; I just made it!
