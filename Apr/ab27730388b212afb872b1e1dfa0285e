THE Dladla family was woken from their sleep on Monday by flames swallowing their seven-roomed house.Luckily all 10 of them escaped unharmed, and for two hours they battled to save their home in Cotton Lands, near Verulam.The shock set in later when they realised there was no explanation for the fire other than vutha! The family said the mystery surrounding the cause of the fire makes them fear for their lives.Ntombifuthi Dladla (25) said there were no electrical connections or anybody sleeping in her mum&rsquo;s bedroom where the fire began.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe in muthi and witchcraft stories, but this incident was strange. The windows were closed and showed no sign that something like a petrol bomb had been thrown in. &ldquo;When we put out the blaze in my mum&rsquo;s room, it suddenly started in other parts of the house. We battled it for nearly two hours.&rdquo; Ntombifuthi said the fire left parts of the house badly damaged and had made family members panic.&ldquo;Neighbours told us that it could be vutha.&rdquo; She said six kids had been left without their school books and uniforms. &ldquo;We need all the help we can get. We are grateful for the donation of beds, clothes and food we have received so far. &ldquo;The damage to the roof poses a danger, but we are using the remaining rooms for now. &ldquo;Two bedrooms, our kitchen and dining-room were completely destroyed,&rdquo; she said.Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said it was possible that the fire had been caused by vutha. &ldquo;The Dladlas should consult a traditional healer so they can get muthi to get rid of the fire. It may come back if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;Captain Nqobile Gwala said the incident was reported at Verulam Police Station but no case was opened.
