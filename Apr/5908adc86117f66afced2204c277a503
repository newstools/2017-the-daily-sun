THE family of Khayalethu Tobela hoped he would recover from his gunshot wounds and point out who attacked him on Thursday. But tragically, the speaker of Umzimkhulu Municipality, KZN, died in hospital yesterday. According to the family of the 47-year-old, while he was being shot he was heard screaming: &ldquo;I see all of you and I know all of you!&rdquo; Khayalethu&rsquo;s brother, Sibongiseni (50), said he believed the shooting at his brother&rsquo;s home in Emfundweni was connected with the ANC Harry Gwala conference due to take place in June. &ldquo;We believe the shooting was political, as he was deputy secretary of the region. It seems politicians are fighting for his position. They could have killed him because he was likely to be re-elected to the position.&rdquo; Sibongiseni said Khayalethu was very important to his family. &ldquo;We have lost a breadwinner and we don&rsquo;t know how we will survive.&rdquo;Mayor Mphuthumi Mpabanga said there were ongoing fights in Harry Gwala. He said: &ldquo;We may not know the motive behind his shooting, but we suspect it has something to do with faction fighting. Things are getting ugly as the conference approaches.&rdquo; ANC regional secretary Sindi Msomi said they don&rsquo;t know the motive for the killing yet. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;A case of murder is being investigated.&rdquo;
