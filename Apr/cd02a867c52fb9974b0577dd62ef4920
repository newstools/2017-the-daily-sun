MTUBATUBA mayor Qhina Mkhwanazi has issued a strong warning to business people in the municipality.This was after a group of people who claimed to be from various KZN government departments allegedly tried to scam locals.Mkhwanazi said the alleged scammers used the ward councillors to ask for business people&rsquo;s contact details.&ldquo;They told them they were from government departments and would be hosting events around Mtubatuba.&rdquo; He added there are no events they know of. &ldquo;Business people must be cautious at all times. If there is an upcoming event, we will communicate with them about it,&rdquo; said Mkhwanazi.Councillor Siya Khumalo said the alleged scammers had called him. &ldquo;They asked me to give them contact details of a catering company in my area that they wanted to cater for an upcoming event. But they failed to give me more of their details.&rdquo;Khumalo said he learned they wanted to get access to the company&rsquo;s business accounts by fooling them into thinking they would pay them before the event.Another councillor, Jeff Khoza, said they told him they were organising an Arrive Alive campaign and needed a catering company to cater for the event.&ldquo;We are worried they will ask residents for their personal details.&rdquo;KZN social development spokesman Vukani Mbhele said they weren&rsquo;t aware of the matter. &ldquo;If people receive calls, they must report it to their local office or cop shop because we don&rsquo;t have any events taking place in Mtubatuba at the moment.&rdquo; KZN transport spokesman Nathi Sukazi urged residents to report the matter to their local cop shop because the department also knows nothing about the matter.
