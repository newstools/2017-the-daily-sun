A MAN was allegedly assaulted by cash-in-transit security guards, who accused him of trying to rob them. Mongezi Jwaga (26) of Pelzvale farm near Randfontein, west of Joburg, was on his way to a fast food outlet in Randfontein when he parked behind the G4S vehicle. It was blocking the way, so he apparently asked the driver to move his vehicle so he could pass. &ldquo;The driver just gave me attitude and said I must not tell them how to do their job.&ldquo;Trying to avoid an altercation, I drove behind them. They were driving very slowly, and I decided to overtake them,&rdquo; he said.He said that move proved almost fatal as the G4S vehicle followed him and started chasing him down the road. &ldquo;I pulled up on the side of the road and asked why they were following me. Without warning, a man got out of the vehicle and dragged me out and started to beat me.&rdquo; His sister Conny Jwaga (38), who was a passenger in the car, saw the incident. She said: &ldquo;They accused my brother of wanting to rob them.&ldquo;They punched and threw him on the ground and continued to kick him. When I tried to stop them they threatened to beat me as well.&rdquo;Police spokesman Aubrey Moopeloa said police are investigating a case of assault.G4S spokeswoman Odette Maree said: &ldquo;We received a complaint from the SAPS about the incident. Our guards informed us about a suspicious car which followed them everywhere they went. &ldquo;Our security officers have reported to the police station and we are also conducting our own investigations.&rdquo;
