BETTY Tshesane and her grandkids had a taxi ride from hell on Thursday.The 89-year-old gogo from Mamelodi West, Tshwane, called a meter taxi to go to town. She wanted to buy groceries with her two grandkids, aged five and seven. When the black VW Citi Golf came, there were two women passengers. &ldquo;At first the driver went towards town, but then he increased speed and changed direction. &ldquo;When I asked where he was taking us, one of the women slapped me in the face,&rdquo; she said.Gogo Betty started screaming and the women responded by beating her. &ldquo;They also beat the kids. When I tried to call for help they took a handkerchief and shoved it in my mouth.&ldquo;The thugs demanded all the money I had on me. After they had taken the cash, they threw me and the kids out of the car.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Jan Sepato said cases of robbery, abduction and assault were opened. Four Plus One Meter Taxi Association chairman Jabu Madola (40) said they didn&rsquo;t know who robbed the gogo. &ldquo;It must be thugs pretending to be working with us. But we&rsquo;ll find them,&rdquo; he said.
