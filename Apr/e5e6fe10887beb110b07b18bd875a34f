A BATTLE for survival!It would not be wrong to classify the clash between bottom side Baroka FC and fellow strugglers Free State Stars at the New Peter Mokaba Stadium tonight (7.30pm) as a relegation battle. Getting knocked out of the Nedbank Cup could work in both Baroka and Ea Lla Koto&rsquo;s favour, however, as they can focus on collecting league points in their bid to retain their PSL status.Only four points separate the sides, with Baroka on 18 points and Stars 14th with 22 points. Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane is hoping for a home victory tonight as they are skating on thin ice and in danger of losing their top flight status. Thobejane will have his fingers crossed that they can pull off a miracle similar to when they beat SuperSport United at Mbombela Stadium a week ago.Said Thobejane: &ldquo;We are waiting for them to come give us our first three points at home. We have waited too long for our first win at home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working on our attack, our finishing has given us sleepless nights. &ldquo;In the Nedbank Cup (against Platinum Stars) we had three clear cut chances but could not score. I know there&rsquo;s no way to score with every chance you create but goals should come against Stars.&rdquo;Baroka haven&rsquo;t lost a league match since February when they lost to pace-setters Cape Town City. &ldquo;We have to save our status. Football is not easy, you can&rsquo;t get away from that. &ldquo;We got three points from SuperSport and if we win on Tuesday, we will have got two wins in a row. We will get there,&rdquo; Thobejane said.
