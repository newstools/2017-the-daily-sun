UKHOZI FM may soon be a hive of serious activity when it allegedly kicks off its major changes. According to the grapevine, the isiZulu radio station will set off a reshuffle in a bid to make shows more appealing to listeners.&nbsp;Insiders claimed the Vuka Mzansi breakfast show would be a one-man affair when co-host and actress, Zama Ngcobo, is separated from Sipho &ldquo;DJ Sgqemeza&rdquo; Mbatha.&nbsp;Said the first source: &ldquo;Following public outcry over her behaviour, Zama will be redeployed in a night-time show.&nbsp;&ldquo;Many complaints were received by the station last year alone. At some point, listeners created a Facebook page where they demanded that she be removed from the show and the station.&nbsp; &ldquo;As much as she has been there for more than three years, it was too much for the station&rsquo;s management to stomach.&rdquo;&nbsp;But a second insider was adamant that Tshatha Ngobe and Selby Mkhize, co-hosts of the Woza Nabangani Bakho show, would not be disbanded.&nbsp;&ldquo;Those guys are the pillars of Ukhozi FM. Their show is currently doing well . The same goes for Dudu Khoza of the Amajukujuku show,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Those people are able to reach out to the young and mature audience, as well as listeners from suburban and rural areas. They&rsquo;ve worked hard to draw the right listenership to the station, so if Ukhozi were to let them go, it&rsquo;d be a big blunder.&rdquo;&nbsp;Claimed a third source: &ldquo;Those who will be affected by the reshuffle include Sigiya Ngengoma co-host Ngizwe Mchunu, being moved to a midnight show.&rdquo;&nbsp; But his co-host Bheka Mchunu would have to wait for Ukhozi management to learn who his female co-host would be.&nbsp;&ldquo;The female DJ is said to be from a community radio station. There are no new presenters in the show, except for the female DJ who will work with Bheka.&nbsp;&ldquo;Nethezeka host Mroza Buthelezi is likely to be joined by&nbsp;Sbu Buthelezi.&rdquo;&nbsp;SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago refused to comment on the matter, saying the public broadcaster would make an announcement about the changes scheduled to take place on all the radio stations soon.&nbsp;Zama did not respond to our questions at the time of going to print.&nbsp;
