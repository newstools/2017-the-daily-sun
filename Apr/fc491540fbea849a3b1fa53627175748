S&rsquo;KHUNJULIWE Mhlongo died in a fire on Friday after trying to burn impepho to talk to his mother&rsquo;s ancestors! The 30-year-old from Ndwedwe, near KwaDukuza was found on his knees next to a pot of umqombothi, in a rondavel.At the time of his death, his mum&rsquo;s family, the Khuzwayos, were preparing for a traditional ceremony that was supposed to take place on Saturday. His sister, Thandeka, said the ceremony was postponed after her brother&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;My brother was drunk when he died. He wanted to burn impepho but we prevented him because as a nephew of the Khuzwayos, he&rsquo;s not allowed to do that. His father&rsquo;s family, the Mhlongos, are Christian and don&rsquo;t burn impepho,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;We suspect S&rsquo;khunjuliwe went to burn impepho while we were all asleep. It looks as if he was also drinking traditional beer.&rdquo; She said the family was woken by huge flames coming from the rondavel. Thandeka said she believed her brother couldn&rsquo;t run or scream because he was too drunk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Christian and I don&rsquo;t believe my brother was punished by the ancestors. &ldquo;I believe everything is planned by God.&rdquo; Thandeka said she wouldn&rsquo;t apologise to the ancestors because she doesn&rsquo;t believe in them. &ldquo;We need to accept what happened and move on.&rdquo; The SunTeam tried to speak to the Khuzwayos but they referred all questions to Thandeka. South African Traditional Healers Association president Sazi Mhlongo said S&rsquo;khunjuliwe might have been punished for burning impepho because he&rsquo;s a nephew of the Khuzwayo family. &ldquo;Families have only one member who burns impepho. Someone else might also die or have bad luck if they do it.&rdquo;KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said an inquest docket was opened.
