ORLANDO Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret reckons their 2-0 win over Maritzburg United that ended a 12-match winless run on Tuesday is a strong foundation to build on.Ayanda Gcaba and Dove Wome scored the goals that moved Bucs away from the relegation zone and brought a smile to their fans&rsquo; faces. Pirates are now in ninth position in the table on 26 points from 22 matches.Said Jonevret: &ldquo;I was a bit worried after the opening 10 minutes. I thought we looked a little tired. I think the Nedbank Cup Last 16 game against Free State Stars (4-1 win) took a lot out of the players, both mentally and physically. &ldquo;Players felt they really wanted to win that one, as it was our second game against them in the same week. &ldquo;I am glad they handled this game well. It was nice that we scored from a corner (via Gcaba). We could relax a little after that and were lucky not to concede in the first half, because Maritzburg played smart.&rdquo;The Swedish mentor said he didn&rsquo;t care how his charges played as long as they collected points. Bucs face bottom club Highlands Park in their next league clash at Makhulong Stadium in Tembisa on Saturday. Added Jonevret: &ldquo;Their two red cards (Deolin Mekoa and Brian Onyango) helped us a little bit. But in the end I don&rsquo;t care that we missed chances and I don&rsquo;t care that everything didn&rsquo;t look perfect. &ldquo;We won today, kept a clean sheet, got three points and that was absolutely crucial. Now we have something to build on &ndash; it was nice to win again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more relief than happiness. I am happy the supporters are happy and it&rsquo;s two down, one to go this week. We have three days to prepare.&rdquo; Gcaba was delighted that their defence, which has conceded 33 goals so far, is more solid. The tough-as-teak defender is confident they will qualify for the MTN8 Cup.He said: &ldquo;Our confidence was a bit low but we told ourselves we&rsquo;re in this position now, so we just need to work hard and soldier on. We never gave up and now we&rsquo;re fighting for that top eight spot. &ldquo;And let&rsquo;s wait and see how far we go in the Nedbank Cup.&rdquo;
