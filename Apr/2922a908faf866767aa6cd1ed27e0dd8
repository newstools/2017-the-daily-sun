NEITHER SuperSport United nor Kaizer Chiefs are taking the upcoming Nedbank Cup quarterfinal match casually. Both sides are capable league title contenders, while the cup competition offers another a path to continental competitions &ndash; and they would like to win everything on offer. Matsatsantsa a Pitori have been struggling in the league lately but progressing to the Last 8 and the group stages of the Caf Confederation Cup has given captain Dean Furman the confidence that they will do well in their cup clash at FNB Stadium tomorrow (6pm).He doesn&rsquo;t believe having a number of former Chiefs players in their team gives them any special tricks up their sleeve.Said Furman: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always special going to your old club, whether you left as a hero or not. The guys we have from Chiefs are highly professional. &ldquo;They know what it takes to be successful and they want to win this game as much as they wanted to win the last round. &ldquo;We are looking to take the trophy back to SuperSport, that&rsquo;s our end goal.&rdquo;Amakhosi will go into the match with fresher players, having last played last Saturday, while SuperSport have played in the Confed Cup and a league match against neighbours Mamelodi Sundowns. Chiefs coach Steve Komphela said they were trying to manage their players well and keep them fresh ahead of each game. He said they would not read too much into SuperSport&rsquo;s most recent league results: &ldquo;There are people who thrive on challenges and Stuart is one of them. &ldquo;We have to forget the run we&rsquo;ve had, it counts for nothing. We have to fight for every match, for every competition.&rdquo;
