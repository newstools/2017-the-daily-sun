GOLDEN Arrows attacking midfielder Kudakwashe Mahachi believes they have what it takes to pile the pressure on Mamelodi Sundowns this weekend.Sundowns have not won a league match in four outings but have proven to be a different side when it comes to cup games. They have knocked Mariveni United out of Nedbank Cup and registered a 2-1 win against Kampala City Capital Authority in the Caf Champions League.Now the Brazilians, who just lost 2-1 to Kaizer Chiefs in the league at the weekend, have a Ke Yona date with Arrows on Saturday in the Last 16 stage of the tournament at Lucas Moripe Stadium.Despite making it clear that he has nothing to prove against his former club, the 23-year-old Mahachi will carry Arrows&rsquo; hopes and spearhead their bid to pump in the goals against the reigning PSL champions.This also has the makings of a grudge match after Downs defeated Arrows 3-0 in the league in November last year. In addition to their cup clash on Saturday, they have league date on 28 April.The Zimbabwean is in his second season at Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende after a somewhat unsuccessful spell with the Brazilians. Said Mahachi: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going there to play my normal game, to play like I&rsquo;ve been playing this season.&rdquo; Mahachi was on top of his game when Arrows beat neighbours Maritzburg United 3-1 in the Last 32 of the Nedbank Cup, scoring their third goal.He also scored a winner for Arrows in their previous league match on Saturday, a 2-1 victory over Highlands Park. He added: &ldquo;Sundowns are not a small team. Playing them will always be difficult. They are not a team to be underestimated, despite going through a rough patch. &ldquo;We know they are difficult to beat at home but we are going there to try and change that.&rdquo;
