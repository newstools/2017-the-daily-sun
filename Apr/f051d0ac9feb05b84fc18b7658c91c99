THE four smugglers thought they could outsmart the cops. But their plan, like their crime, was plain stupid!They were bust in Mpumalanga, at the Mahamba border post between Swaziland and Mzansi, on Thursday.Cops said the suspects, who were travelling in a silver Mercedes-Benz, tried to drive past the vehicle checkpoint.Cops and defence force members searched the inside of the car, as well as its four passengers, and asked the driver to open the bonnet.The driver claimed the bonnet was broken, but cops forced him to open it.They found two huge rhino horns hidden in the engine compartment!The driver tried to evade arrest by running into nearby bushes, but even that plan failed . . . Cops caught him and bust him, together with the three occupants of the car!They were charged with unlawful possession of rhino horns.
