WHAT was an ordinary day at a mall soon turned into a shoot-out when five thugs stormed a jewellery store at Festival Mall in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni on Monday. According to witnesses, the thugs headed straight for a jewellery store. Security guards responded and there was a gun battle. Police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubele told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The armed men barged into Technogold Jewellers and smashed the glass case where the jewellery was kept. When the owner came out, the men pulled out guns and began shooting at her. &ldquo;She was also armed and shot back but the thugs managed to flee with some jewellery. Mall security tried to stop the thugs exiting through the boom gates and a security guard was shot and wounded.&rdquo; The security guard and the owner of the store are in a stable condition in hospital. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said paramedics found the security guard in the parking lot of the mall. &ldquo;He had been shot in the chest and was in a critical condition.&rdquo; Makhubele said the store owner was shot in the leg. &ldquo;The centre management has video footage of the incident and is working closely with the police to bring the suspects to book,&rdquo; he said.
