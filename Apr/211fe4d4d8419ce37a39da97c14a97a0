PEOPLE took to the street yesterday to express their anger over a contract to build a new dam in their area. Mpho Mahatsa from Eldorado Park, south of Joburg, said they closed down the construction site because locals had not been hired.&ldquo;Residents were promised by the councillor that they would benefit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Instead, we are sitting here, unemployed, while outsiders are working.&rdquo; The company responsible for the project is Umzinyathi Construction. Owner Sodesani Nike said: &ldquo;These people are lying. I have nothing further to say about the matter.&rdquo; Councillor Oupa Ngwenya said it was sad that those who complained about being jobless had shut the project down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying my best to have the site reopened so people can get jobs. We were told it could possibly open again after Easter.&rdquo;
