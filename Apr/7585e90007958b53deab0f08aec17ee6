NOMALI Mhlongo claimed she hasn&rsquo;t received her social grants for nine months, but officials denied this. The 54-year-old mum from F section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, now believes Sassa workers at the Bridge City offices stole her money. &ldquo;Last July, I went to renew my grant, but when I went to the ATM the next month there was no money,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I went to the Sassa offices to ask what was going on, and they said someone with the same ID number as mine was collecting my grant. &ldquo;I asked the official to give me more details about the ID situation, but she refused.&rdquo; When she returned in September she was told she had already been paid. &ldquo;I have not had a problem with my ID in other places. I didn&rsquo;t go to Home Affairs because I suspect they&rsquo;re lying.&rdquo; She was supposed to get a R1 500 disability grant because she has diabetes and arthritis, as well as R1 500 for her child who is living with a disability, and R360 for child support every month. Mbizeni Mdlalose, Sassa spokesman, said they were investigating the matter. &ldquo;I have contacted the woman and I&rsquo;m helping her,&rdquo; he said. Thabo Mokgola, Home Affairs spokesman, said her ID number had never been identified as a possible duplicate case.&ldquo;The possibility exists that a third party may be using her ID to fraudulently access social grants at Sassa.&rdquo; He advised Nomali to have an online verification done at one of the department&rsquo;s offices to prove she&rsquo;s the rightful owner of the ID number. He said Sassa and Home Affairs would have to match the fingerprint samples they had on their records.
