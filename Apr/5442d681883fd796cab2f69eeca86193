AJAX Cape Town held Golden Arrows to a 1-1 draw in an Absa Premiership match played at Princess Magogo Stadium yesterday. Ajax striker Prince Nxumalo cancelled out Nkayiso Mngwengwe&rsquo;s goal to ensure his side snatch a vital point to occupy tenth spot on 26 points from 24 matches.&nbsp;Arrows remain in sixth position on 31 points from the same number of matches.&nbsp;Ajax were looking for back to back victory since December last year having beaten bottom club Highlands Park 1-0 in their last league clash played in Cape Town on Wednesday.&nbsp;They were eager to continue their dominance over Arrows having beaten them 1-0 in the first round at home on 3 December.&nbsp;On the other hand, Arrows were hoping to put behind their poor performances which saw them get hammered 3-0 by Bidvest Wits in their last league game midweek.&nbsp;The Students brought Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende down to earth after they booted out Caf Champions Mamelodi Sundowns from the Nedbank Cup with a 1-0 win.&nbsp;Arrows coach Clinton Larsen was hoping his defence will stop leaking goals as they have the third worst defence in the Premiership having now conceded 34 goals.&nbsp;Ajax had the upper hand early on playing a quick passing game hoping to get an early goal. Veteran striker Mark Mayambela seems to have left his scoring boots at home as he shot wide with only Arrows keeper Nkosingiphile Gumede to beat as early as the second minute.&nbsp;The former Orlando Pirates player could not believe it as his goal in the sixth minute from inside the penalty box was ruled offside by referee Cedric Muvhali.&nbsp;However, Arrows defender Mngwengwe took advantage of a blunder by Ajax goalkeeper Jody February to grab the lead with a clinical finish in the 13th minutes.&nbsp;The Urban Warriors never gave up fighting as they continued to pile pressure on Arrows defence after the break.&nbsp;The visitors got rewarded in the 78th minutes when Nxumalo headed home Thabo Mosadi corner. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
