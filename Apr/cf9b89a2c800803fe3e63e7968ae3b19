THE Eastern Cape government has spent R1,6 billion on building a new state-of-the-art wing at the Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane kasi.Premier Phumulo Masualle visited the hospital recently and instructed Health MEC Pumza Dyantyi to continue with plans to move in the first group of patients. The facility has been fitted with new equipment valued at about R300 million, including a scope room where specialised cameras will capture patients&rsquo; internal images, and children&rsquo;s and general wards have also been built. The facility will be digitally connected to Victoria Hospital in Alice, Butterworth Hospital and Idutywa Community Health Centre. Speaking at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital during his visit on Thursday, the premier said: &ldquo;This is part of our effort to improve healthcare services in our province. &ldquo;We will not be demolishing everything at the old building, because there are other things it can be used for.Dyantyi said Cecilia Makiwane&rsquo;s operating theatre would provide relief to some of the province&rsquo;s other hospitals. &ldquo;Rural hospitals will also benefit because their patients are going to be helped here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We urge people to look after this hospital. They must make sure they take care of it.&rdquo; Eastern Cape Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said people would soon be moved to the new building, which was expected to open as early as next month.
