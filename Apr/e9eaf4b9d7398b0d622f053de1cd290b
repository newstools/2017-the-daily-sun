PASTOR Mboro is furious with a bank he claims mistreated him. The controversial pastor of Incredible Happenings Ministries was kicked out of Absa Bank in Alberton, Ekurhuleni, on Tuesday. The pastor, whose real name is Paseka Motsoeneng, said all he wanted was his money back. He said the bank processed illegal debit orders and other fees he had never agreed to. After he confronted bank staff, he was kicked out by security guards and not allowed to enter the bank again.Angry Mboro said: &ldquo;All I wanted was my money. I cannot sit and watch while my account is being milked.&rdquo;He claimed that close to R1 million has been taken from his account.Mboro said the problem started in 2012 after he changed from a small business to a medium business account to avoid queues when visiting the bank. &ldquo;Since then there have been questionable transactions and debit orders but the bank does not care.&rdquo; The pastor opened cases of intimidation, harassment and fraud at Alberton Police Station, which were confirmed by cops. Liezl Squier, Absa&rsquo;s relations manager, said: &ldquo;We are investigating the matter as we are trying to find out what happened that day. &ldquo;We still need to view the CCTV footage.&rdquo; She said it could take some time to find out what happened.
