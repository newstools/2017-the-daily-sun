A NEW viral video shows women shaving their faces for the purpose of easier make-up application. The practice of taking a micro-razor to remove&nbsp;&ldquo;peach fuzz&rdquo; (soft hair) became a much-talked about and hotly- contested subject.A common Japanese trend&nbsp; This practice is not that fringe, though. According to Refinery29.com kao sori (dermaplaning or face shaving) is common in Japan. And in the US, dermaplaning has been employed for a few years to treat fine lines and wrinkles. Why so strange?&nbsp; The thought of straight women shaving their faces seems pretty weird. It&rsquo;s funny how normal waxing seems &ndash; when we have our pubes ripped from their follicles in a process that feels like being struck by lightning. Women already wax, pluck and thread the hell out of their faces, so why not go for the seemingly more painless option of shaving &ldquo;down under&rdquo;. The Guardian&rsquo;s Anita Bhagwandas notes that &ldquo;&hellip;regrowth as the result of a razor &ndash; compared with waxing, threading and depilatory creams &ndash; is a colossal pain.&rdquo; And she also challenges the idea that shaving leads to more youthful-looking skin. Men have more collagen than women. So comparing a man shaving his face to a woman shaving her face is basically like comparing an elephant to an oyster. Shaving can cause skin damage and faster aging as well as stubble, ingrown hairs and razor burns. So weigh up the odds before you decide to shave. But if you do, at least make-up will go on smoothly!&nbsp;
