THEIR marriage has been going strong for 17 years, and they say it&rsquo;s because of Kofifi tsotsi taal. &ldquo;When I get angry, Ronnie uses Kofifi scamto to soften me up,&rdquo; said Lydia Masilo (53), who is from Uptown section in Bekkersdal, west of Joburg. &ldquo;He uses words like &ndash; thimlela, my sweet ding and my liefie &ndash; and that&rsquo;s how he charms me.&rdquo; Thimlela means &ldquo;Let it go&rdquo;. On Saturday, Ronnie Masilo (60) and Lydia invited guests to celebrate their 17th marriage anniversary and Ronnie&rsquo;s 60th birthday. Lydia said Ronnie speaks Kofifi tsotsi taal almost all the time. The couple&rsquo;s daughter, Monki Serobatse, said her father is a great dad. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t take life too seriously. He is an ardent jazz lover and he calls people, &lsquo;oumati&rsquo; which means my friend,&rdquo; said Monki. &ldquo;When we are out of line, he comes with his tsotsi taal to keep the peace. &ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t tolerate disrespect in his house.&rdquo; Lydia is originally from Ga-Motlatla near Ventersdorp, but she is proud of their scamto lifestyle which has kept their marriage together all these years. Ronnie&rsquo;s other two kids, Tshepo Masilo and Naniki Serobatse, kept laughing when Ronnie tried to keep a serious face during the celebrations. Ronnie works as a street sweeper in their kasi and Lydia is a professional nurse at the local clinic. They live in a nine-roomed house and are blessed with six children and six grandkids.
