NATIONAL First Division leaders Thanda Royal Zulu could take a giant step towards promotion to the Absa Premiership when they host second placed Black Leopards at the Umhlathuze Sports Complex tomorrow (3pm).Thanda, on 48 points, have opened up a nine-point gap on Leopards after they drew 1-1 with Jomo Cosmos at Tsakane Stadium at the weekend.Bad news for Leopards was their shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Real Kings in Thohoyandou.Lidoda Duvha remain second on 39 points and have to beat Thanda tomorrow to stand any chance of pipping them to the post.Thanda, however, now need no more than four victories and one draw to return to the top flight after a seven-year absence.With only seven games remaining Amabhubesi, who have been leading since day one, look set to be crowed NFD champions and book their place in the top flight next year. Thanda have another important game that could determine the outcome of the title race when they play third placed Stellenbosch FC at home early next month. Stellenbosch, previously known as Vasco Da Gama, are another former PSL side looking to return to the Premiership. They moved to 37 points after beating Witbank Spurs 2-1 at home at the weekend.Thanda coach Roger Sikhakhane said: &ldquo;We are still on the right track. A point away against Cosmos was not a bad result. At this stage we know what we need to get right in order to be promoted.&rdquo;Leopards surprised everyone when they climbed from seventh place to second at the beginning of the second round under new coach Francois Losciuto. The Belgian mentor has done well since he arrived at Leopards but says it is too early to entertain any promotion talk, athough they are determined to make a fight of it.Said Losciuto: &ldquo;We still have many games to play and we will fight until our final match.&rdquo;
