THE Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor had a rude awakening during his kasi tour yesterday. Mongameli Bobani visited the KwaDwesi Police Station with his delegation, only to find the gate locked. His delegation was told to go home because the station commander was not there. Bobani was visiting the station following the fatal shooting of a man who tried to enter the troubled station. As he was leaving the station, he was called back by Warrant Officer Nomachule Sali, who welcomed him. Bobani then left the cop shop and headed to his next stop &ndash; KwaDwesi Extension in Port Elizabeth. There an RDP owner told him to voetsek! &ldquo;Get out of my house! I have been promised heaven and earth by the municipality. Five ward councillors promised to fix my house but up to now, I&rsquo;m still stuck in this crumbling house,&rdquo; screamed Lulama Tyali (41). &ldquo;My RDP is falling apart and has big cracks and holes all over. I&rsquo;ve had enough of liars like you. I don&rsquo;t want to be deceived again, please leave me alone&rdquo; A disappointed Bobani and his delegation left.However, Bobani said he understood where her outburst came from and promised to be back once Lulama had calmed down.Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;Her plight had been registered with the Eastern Cape provincial priority disaster programme. We are going to intervene very soon.&rdquo;
