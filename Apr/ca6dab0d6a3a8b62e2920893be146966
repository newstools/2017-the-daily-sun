THESE former students are angry.About 20 students who did a course in home-based health care at Workforce Solutions claim their certificates are useless.Yesterday, they protested outside the centre at Pier 14 in North End, Port Elizabeth.Nosiphiwo Mani (37), spokeswoman for the students, said: &ldquo;We had an appointment with the centre principal, Patrys Wolmarans, today to sort out the problems about our fong kong certificates, but she refused to talk to us.&ldquo;We only learnt last month that our certificates were useless, when some of us were rejected by Lilitha Nursing College at Dora Nginza Hospital. We were told the course we studied wasn&rsquo;t registered with either the department of education or health.&rdquo; Wolmarans said: &ldquo;We have been running the centre for 17 years without problems, and we have placed 17 000 people in jobs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also placed our students at a provincial hospital and Livingstone Hospital, and they are satisfied with what we are offering.&rdquo;Daily Sun couldn&rsquo;t get comment from the health and education departments at the time of going to print. However, deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani, who is also chairman for health in the metro, said: &ldquo;We will investigate the matter.&rdquo;
