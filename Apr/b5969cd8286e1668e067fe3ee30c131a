WHEN SANGOMA Janet dreamt she was living in a shack, she should have known it was a warning from the ancestors.&nbsp; Because soon after that, her raging Ben 10 allegedly destroyed her house and stole her possessions!&nbsp; NOW JANET IS LIVING IN A BACK ROOM AND THE BEN 10 IS BEHIND BARS. JANET Letswalo (56) told Daily Sun she didn&rsquo;t know she was heading for trouble when she took a Ben 10, aged 35, into her 10-roomed house and her double bed 15 months ago. &ldquo;At first life was great, but then I realised our relationship couldn&rsquo;t last because we had too many differences. &ldquo;So when I went to see my family for a family gathering last Friday I told him to pack his things and get out of my house.&rdquo; But before she even reached the gathering, she got a call from a neighbour. &ldquo;I was told my house was on fire,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; She claimed the Ben 10 had set her house alight. Her dining-room, three bedrooms, kitchen and bathrooms were all burnt down. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even determine the cost of my loss. Everything I worked for over so many years has gone up in smoke,&rdquo; said Janet, sitting in the back room of her house in Sebokeng, in the Vaal. After the fire, she remembered the warning dream the ancestors had sent her a week before. But Janet is not entirely satisfied that the warning she got was clear enough. &ldquo;I wish my ancestors had been more specific about what was going to happen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I rely on them for guidance. &ldquo;Dreaming about a shack didn&rsquo;t tell me much because I thought they were showing me something else.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never thought they were talking to me about myself. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m living in the backyard of my own house. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need help. I&rsquo;m not working anymore.&rdquo; A case of arson has been opened at Sebokeng Police Station. Sebokeng cop shop spokesman Captain Tebogo Lephotho confirmed that a case has been opened. &ldquo;Police are still investigating the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;We confirm that a suspect who could be linked to the incident has been arrested in Evaton after allegedly fleeing from the Sebokeng area,&rdquo; said Captain Lephotho.
