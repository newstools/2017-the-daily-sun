ONE moment the river was green, the next it was clear and clean.This was not because the river flowing past the Gold Rush Morula Sun Hotel in Mabopane, Tshwane, had been cleaned . . . It was because the river snake living in the waters was pleased!An annual traditional ritual was being performed at the river bank by sangomas on Wednesday afternoon.This year&rsquo;s ceremony was held to introduce the new hotel owners to the snake.Traditional healers, led by sangoma Mapula Rakale (62), helped by the SPCA and hotel staff, slaughtered a cow.In the early hours of Thursday morning, a live goat and chickens were thrown into the river to introduce the owners so their business would do well.The SPCA&rsquo;s Inspector Meshack Matlou wanted to make sure the cow was killed in a humane way.
