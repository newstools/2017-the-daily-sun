RESIDENTS of Amalinda Forest in East London live in fear . . . The street lights aren&rsquo;t working, and this has led to an increase in crime! When darkness falls, thugs come out to terrorise the people.Madala Mthuthuzeli Nkohla (70), a resident, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible in this area at night because our street lights are not working. &ldquo;The problem started in December and I reported the matter to our councillor and the mayor, but nothing has been done. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know. Maybe lighting is a privilege and not a right. People have been robbed and stabbed in this area ever since the lights went off. &ldquo;Our councillor only cares about certain areas. As we speak, there are lights in his area. Maybe many people will have to die here before they come and help us.&rdquo; Another resident, David Tempi (40), said the bad guys were taking advantage of the situation. &ldquo;These guys rob you and run away because they can hide in the dark. Housebreakings have also increased.&rdquo; Councillor Mzukisi Relu said the problem was caused by illegal power connections. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not only street lights that are affected by illegal connections,&rdquo; Relu told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;Appliances have also been damaged by izinyoka. &ldquo;The municipality is trying to come up with a solution to stop izinyoka.&ldquo;Municipal workers come and fix these street lights, but before long the lights go off again.&rdquo;
