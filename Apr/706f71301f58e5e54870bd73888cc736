THE ANC in Gauteng wants its branches and regions to come up with a battle plan to fight state capture.News24 understands that the party made the decision at an extraordinary provincial working committee meeting yesterday. The meeting was held to discuss the current political dynamics in the country.Divisions in the ANC have taken centre stage following the &ldquo;midnight massacre&rdquo; of the national executive by President Jacob Zuma last week.Three of the ANC's top six leaders have criticised how the change in the executive was implemented by the president, with Zuma's deputy Cyril Ramaphosa describing the axing of ministers as "totally unacceptable".ANC Gauteng spokesman Nkenke Kekana confirmed the meeting had taken the resolution."We will fight state capture in whichever way it manifests itself," said Kekana.The phenomenon has increasingly become a topic of discussion, amid claims that close associates of the president, the Gupta family, have captured the state through undue influence.In her State of Capture report, former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela recommended that Zuma institute a judicial commission of inquiry into the matter, but Zuma is appealing the recommendation.When asked about the province's views on recent events, Kekana said Gauteng would wait for political direction from the national ANC's extended national working committee, which meets tomorrow.He said Gauteng would also convene a provincial executive committee meeting tomorrow to give its own executive feedback."We will articulate the views of Gauteng that have been canvassed in the last year or so on state capture," said Kekana.Provincial ANC chairman Paul Mashatile said last year Gauteng wanted to stand with South Africans fighting corruption and state capture."If there is any individual who defends state capture in the ANC, we are prepared to fight that person."State capture is actually the enemy of our revolution," he said.South Africans should all be focusing on fighting state capture, Kekana said.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/we-will-fight-anyone-in-our-party-who-defends-state-capture-gauteng-anc-20170404
