FOR the first time, the Port St Johns&rsquo; Magistrates Court was filled to capacity. All the Kwantsila villagers and those from surrounding areas appeared to have come out in numbers to attend the case of a man accused of chopping up and eating his nephew. Yesterday the small rural courtroom overflowed with people hoping to catch a glimpse of the accused. Those who could not squeeze in waited outside, to hear from those who managed to get inside. When the 30-year-old man finally appeared he seemed dazed.He appeared for under 10 minutes and was formally charged with murder.On Wednesday the SunTeam ran a report about a four-year-old boy, Kamvelihle Ngala, whose body parts were discovered by his gogo on Easter Monday inside the man&rsquo;s flat at the family homestead.According to police, the man served a seven- year sentence for murder in Joburg and was &shy;released in August. He will appear in court for a bail application on 2 May.
