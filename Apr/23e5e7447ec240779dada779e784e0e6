AYANDA MABULU&rsquo;s recent controversial painting has angered both the ANC and the Nelson Mandela Foundation! The painting, which has caused mixed emotions, depicts President Jacob Zuma in a sexual act with the late former president.The artist released the work last Thursday &ndash; and not everyone was happy!The Nelson Mandela Foundation said they found the painting distasteful.&ldquo;The foundation would like to express that it respects Mabulu&rsquo;s right to freedom of expression. However, we find this painting distasteful.&rdquo; The ANC is considering taking the legal route if necessary.ANC spokeswoman Khusela Sangoni said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve requested an opinion from our legal representatives. But we&rsquo;re also calling on the ANC structures, as well as the people of South Africa in general, to confront and challenge these things.&rdquo; In his defence Mabulu said he could not have put the message across any other way.&ldquo;This is the true reflection of how South Africa has become today, only because of one man. This is meant to show that Zuma belongs in a rubbish bin because he has failed the country.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not the first time Ayanda has made headlines with his art. He is the man behind the Spear Down My Throat painting as well.
