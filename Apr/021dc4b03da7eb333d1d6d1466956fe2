THE nightmare started when their daughter disappeared on Friday &ndash; and it seems the cops haven&rsquo;t made it any easier for the family!When Nqobile Sibiya (33) from Katlehong, Ekurhuleni went to report that her daughter Anetha (13) was missing, the cops at Katlehong Police Station apparently told Nqobile she was probably with her boyfriend.The next day she went back to the police station. &ldquo;I was again told to come back later,&rdquo; said Nqobile.Another day went by and the police allegedly still refused to help her. On Sunday, she went to an inyanga who threw the bones and told her he could help.He had a tortoise which directed them to a shack in Mandela squatter camp. They went there with the inyanga but her hopes were shattered when they returned home with nothing. &ldquo;There was no one in the shack. The people in the area told us the occupants of the shack had recently moved out.&rdquo; When Daily Sun visited Nqobile yesterday, residents had gathered on the street to discuss the matter and the cops were called.Luckily, they arrived.Katlehong SAPS spokesman Captain Mega Ndobe told Daily Sun there will be an internal investigation to see if procedure was followed.Ndobe explained that a file was opened for the family but there was a misunderstanding between the cops and the family about tracing the phone the girl was carrying.&ldquo;That has been sorted out and the police will begin the investigation,&rdquo; he said.
