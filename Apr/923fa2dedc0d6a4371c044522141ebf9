THE family of a man and a woman who were burned in their house after being accused of evil deeds are traumatised and feel unsafe. The wife (58) died during the incident at their house in Copesville in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, on Sunday and her husband (65) died in hospital on Tuesday. Family members said they have been receiving death threats from residents since the incident and they had been warned not to reveal the identities of those involved in the crime. A family member said residents claimed the victims kept a baboon in the house. &ldquo;Residents claimed there was a mark made by a baboon&rsquo;s hand on a window of the house. They then gathered to kill the victims, accusing them of evil deeds,&rdquo; said the family member. &ldquo;They hit the victims with sticks and stones before burning down the house with the people inside. The police later found the handprint on the window had been left by a person with glue on their hand.&rdquo; Another relative said they didn&rsquo;t live with the victims, but they saw what happened to them as they live nearby. &ldquo;Some of the residents told us we will die if we reveal their names to the police. We are scared and have nowhere to go,&rdquo; said the relative. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a case of murder was opened. &ldquo;No arrests have been made at this stage but police are investigating,&rdquo; she said.
