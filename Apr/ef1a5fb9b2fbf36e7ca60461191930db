Bidvest Wits head coach Gavin Hunt lamented his sides display that saw the Premiership title chasers dumped out of the last-16 round of the Nedbank Cup on Tuesday evening.The Clever Boys fell to a 5-4 defeat to National First Division side Jomo Cosmos on penalties as the game ended in a 1-1 draw after 120 minutes of play.&nbsp;Cosmos' Linda Mntambo's opening goal was canceled out by Botswana international forward Magokologi Ngele just after the hour mark and Hunt's second-choice side failed to capitalise on their dominance in possession within regulation time."It's difficult to play against Cosmos, we knew what we were up against and all credit to them &ndash; they did what they had to and got through," Hunt told Supersport, after making nine changes to his starting XI from the side who beat Platinum Stars 2-0 on Saturday evening."Tomorrow, no one will remember how they got through but that they did so. I don't know how much possession we had in and around their box, but a lot of players that I gave a chance to weren't there tonight."You learn a lot about people when given a chance and they don't do it for us. So we'll regroup and start again but I'm very disappointed because I thought we did enough to try and work [our way through]."It's always difficult to play against Jomo [Sono] and we knew that, so we should have been better."
