TWO separate shooting incidents have left cops at Ivory Park Police Station traumatised. The first involved a woman who was allegedly shot and injured by her boyfriend in Kaalfontein while the second happened just a few hours later, when a 38-year-old man in Clayville allegedly shot his girlfriend before killing himself. Brigadier David Ngcobo, the commander of the police station in Joburg, told Daily Sun staff were deeply disturbed by the two incidents. Station spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said an inquest docket had been opened after a man who allegedly shot his girlfriend commited suicide. He said cops were called to the couple&rsquo;s home after neighbours reported hearing gunshots. On arrival, they found the couple lying in a pool of blood. &ldquo;The woman told the police she had been shot by her boyfriend, who showed no signs of life by the time cops arrived. He was certified dead at the scene by the paramedic and the woman was taken to hospital,&rdquo; said Matimulane. He said a case of attempted murder was also being investigated.
