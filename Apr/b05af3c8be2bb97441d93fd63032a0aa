FOR years, gogo Adelaide Twala made sure she saved her earnings as a landlord, keeping the cash hidden in her house. After decades of making sure her kids and grandkids&rsquo; school fees were paid, gogo Adelaide said she had saved an amazing R250 000. But now it&rsquo;s all gone! Apparently a relative stole it all and vanished! Gogo Adelaide (83), from Alexandra, north of Joburg said she had no intension of ever seeing the relative again. &ldquo;He had nowhere to stay so I took him in. I used to give him R2 000 every month but he never appreciated that and instead stole my life&rsquo;s savings.&rdquo; The gogo claimed he stole from her last year and that she hasn&rsquo;t seen him since. She opened a case at Alexandra cop shop. &ldquo;Police should hunt him down. He is cruel and heartless,&rdquo; said the heartbroken gogo. Gogo Adelaide said this was not the first time she had been robbed. &ldquo;A man fixing my roof in 2012 stole R14 000 from me. &ldquo;He was busy in the house when he opened a bag I kept money in. &ldquo;He took the money and ran away after pushing me over.&rdquo; She said she opened a case but nothing happened. &ldquo;Instead, I saw the man getting a lift from a cop! &ldquo;Who will help us if the police fail us?&rdquo; Alexandra police spokesman Captain Allie Kodisang said cops were investigating cases of theft. He said police would visit the gogo and update her on the progress of the cases.
