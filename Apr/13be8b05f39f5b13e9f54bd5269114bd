MNQUMA municipal manager Sindile Tantsi&rsquo;s funeral became a springboard for ANC officials to get party issues off their chests.Top regional and national ANC officials, as well as Tantsi&rsquo;s business associates, gathered in Chibini Village, Ntabankulu, Eastern Cape to attend his funeral on Friday.Tantsi (46) met an untimely death when his Mercedes-Benz collided with a bakkie near Harding, in KwaZulu-Natal.At the funeral, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize called for calm and peace.Mkhize warned against using sombre occasions like funerals to address party issues. He said the ANC was bleeding because they had lost a man of honour who fought for the development of his people. Former PSL referee and ANC official Ace Ngcobo, who served with Tantsi in the Amathole Municipality, did not mince words. He slammed the ANC.&ldquo;Tantsi left us at a time when we are being led by weaklings. Our party is now suffering from political dustbin syndrome. We need men like Tantsi, who have backbone,&rdquo; he said. Ngcobo said Tantsi was a man of honour, unlike the party consumerists. The packed tent cheered him as he made calls for people to save the ruling party.Tantsi was one of the first senior officials to be bust by the Hawks for corruption after its head Berning Ntlemeza declared war on corrupt Eastern Cape municipalities.He had been bust for fraud and money laundering and was out on bail.The municipal manager was due to appear in court on 8 May with his co-accused, businessman Sive Nombembe. The two were facing charges related to a R10 million tender awarded to Nombembe two years ago. Lawyer Mvuzo Notyesi said their friend&rsquo;s death left behind a puzzle that still has to be solved and the people with whom he was initially charged have to face justice.Notyesi said: &ldquo;My friend died with the stigma of being accused of stealing millions. His death was not the will of God and is something that needs to be thoroughly investigated.&rdquo;
