FOUR months ago, Tshidi Semema thought she had met the man of her dreams . . . but he allegedly raped and killed her baby boy!&nbsp; The 27-year-old mother from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni says the tragedy happened two weeks ago, when she left her son, Nhlakanipho, in the care of her lover.&nbsp; While she was away, the mother claimed he raped the six-month-old boy and put him in boiling water to get rid of the evidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left my kid with my boyfriend because I had to go to school,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I got home my baby was burned and my boyfriend said it happened while he was playing. When we went to the hospital he told the same story.&rdquo;&nbsp; After spending a few days in hospital, little Nhlakanipho tragically died. Tshidi went looking for her boyfriend to question him but he had disappeared. Pastor Paseka &ldquo;Mboro&rdquo; Motsoeneng was called by the devastated mum to help with funeral arrangements.&nbsp; &ldquo;This place is spiritually in trouble. It&rsquo;s time for residents to turn to God to fight evil,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; The police said the suspect is being sought for rape and murder.
