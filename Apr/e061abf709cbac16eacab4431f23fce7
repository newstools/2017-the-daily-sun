BERNARD MORRISON is in trouble over a car!

The Ghanaian professional footballer, who joined Orlando Pirates last year, has been detained at Douglasdale Police Station in Randburg, Gauteng where he faces charges of robbery. Provincial SAPS spokesman, Captain Mavela Masondo, confirmed the star would appear in the Randburg Magistrates Court late yesterday.
