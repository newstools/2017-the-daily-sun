Just before &nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs&rsquo; historic 2-1 Absa Premiership win against Mamelodi Sundowns at FNB Stadium at the weekend, Vodacom and the #AmakhosiFamily, held a roadshow at Jabulani &nbsp;Mall on Saturday. &nbsp;Fans enjoyed various activities that were lined up for the day, like taking Selfies with Chiefs players in attendance - Camaldine Abraw, Keagan Buchanan and Siphelele Mthembu.&nbsp;Fans also enjoyed challenging each other at the Football and PlayStation areas, while continuously being entertained by the mobile Vodacom Gig Rig. The main event of the afternoon was a draw for an all-expenses paid for #AmakhosiFamily trip to Sun City. This great prize was won by Itumeleng Mbhele and Surprise Phophi. More fans at the stadium were also instantly upgraded to the VIP suite.&nbsp;
