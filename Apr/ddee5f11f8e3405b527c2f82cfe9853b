HUNDREDS of pupils struggle to learn after angry winds blew their school away two months ago! When schools opened yesterday, Nkantsini Senior Primary School pupils in Lujizweni Village near Mthatha had to find shelter at local churches. Principal Gcobani Bango said they pleaded with church members to allow them to use their churches.&ldquo;Our pupils have had a hard time studying in these conditions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The churches have been good to us but there are no toilets, which means kids have to relieve themselves in the bushes.&rdquo;He said the Libode district office promised to provide temporary classrooms but instead sent a contractor to demolish the remaining five classrooms. Nolundi Nomandela of the SGB said the department didn&rsquo;t care about pupils as it was the second time their school had been damaged, yet they did not get help. Linamandla Ncazelo (10) said things had been better since they got a temporary classroom. &ldquo;We used to study outside and it was hard, especially on rainy and hot days.&rdquo; Malibongwe Mtima, provincial education spokesman, said at their level they were not aware of the school&rsquo;s challenges.&ldquo;It should be reported to the district and then to us, should they struggle to resolve the matter. But now that it has reached us through you as the media, we will have to follow up on the matter.&rdquo;Thandeka Vikilahle, the district director, could not immediately respond to queries.
