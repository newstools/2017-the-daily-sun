CRISTIANO Ronaldo asked for immunity from the boos of the ever-demanding Santiago Bernabeu crowd after his hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday fired Real Madrid into the semifinals of the Champions League for a seventh consecutive season. His double in Munich had given Real a 2-1 lead in the first leg. After a couple of wayward shots in the first half provoked whistles from the home supporters, the prolific Portuguese made the difference in an eventual 4-2 win over Bayern after extra time, setting up a 6-3 aggregate victory. His header cancelled out Robert Lewandowski&rsquo;s goal late in the second half and he then finished off Bayern with strikes in either half of extra time after Sergio Ramos&rsquo; own goal had levelled the scores on aggregate &ndash; although his last two goals were from offside positions. Ronaldo&rsquo;s third goal of the night and fifth of the tie saw the Portuguese superstar become the first player to reach 100 goals in the European Champions League, and the four-times World Player of the Year put his finger to his lips to the supporters who had booed him earlier. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking them to name streets after me, the only thing I ask is that they don&rsquo;t boo me here,&rdquo; Ronaldo told Spanish TV station Antena 3. &ldquo;I want them to stop booing me because I always give my best and even when I don&rsquo;t score, I try to help Real Madrid.&rdquo; Manager Zinedine Zidane lavished praise on the team&rsquo;s all-time top scorer but reminded Ronaldo that all of Real players had to get used to the relentless pressure from supporters of the 11-time European champions. &ndash; REUTERS
