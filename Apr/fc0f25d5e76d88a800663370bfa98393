WHEN news broke that Mpume Hlabisa was now a recording gospel singer, it&rsquo;s alleged some gospel artists didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp;Sources claim some gospel stars thought Mpume would stand a better chance of scooping an award at the Crown Gospel Music Awards because of her close relationship with the founder, Zanele Mbokazi-Nkambule, and her husband Bishop Nkambule.&nbsp;According to sources, artists said they knew Mpume attended Bishop Nkambule&rsquo;s World of Hope Ministries and was one of his favourite church members.&nbsp;One source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;What you should know is most gospel artists are jealous. So, when they heard Mpume had recorded an album, they hated it. Some thought she&rsquo;d reduce their chances to shine at the awards.&rdquo;&nbsp;Another source said Mpume found out what other artists were thinking.&nbsp;&ldquo;She found out some artists were unhappy for her and her debut album. So, she decided not to enter the awards. She knew if she won, other artists would think favours were done,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;A third source said Mpume recorded the album after she was convinced by the church members.&nbsp;But she was hesitant because she wanted to use her talent only at church.&nbsp;&ldquo;Several church members talked to her and encouraged her to record her music. Even Zanele encouraged her to us make her voice to be heard outside the church. And she finally changed her mind last year,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;Mpume has released her debut album titled, Ogama Lingu Jesu.&nbsp;When contacted, Mpume confirmed she wouldn&rsquo;t be entering the awards.&nbsp;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t enter because I don&rsquo;t want people to think I won because of my relationship with Mam&rsquo; Nkambule. But I&rsquo;ll enter other awards,&rdquo; she said. She denied hearing about other artists&rsquo; jealousy.Zanele was not available for comment, but Crown Gospel Awards spokesperson Wendy Sithole said they didn&rsquo;t have a problem with her entering the awards. &ldquo;As long as she meets the requirements, she is always welcomed,&rdquo; said Wendy. She said they were aware of the relationship between her the awards founder, but that didn&rsquo;t mean anything like getting special treatment, or a nod ahead of others.&nbsp;
