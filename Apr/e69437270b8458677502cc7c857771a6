TV and radio presenter Bonang Matheba&rsquo;s sour relationship with her alleged former BFF, Somizi Mhlongo, is officially over. That&rsquo;s according to eyewitnesses who attended the Cape Town Polo last month.&ldquo;Queen B&rdquo; allegedly refused to be in the same space as &ldquo;SomG&rdquo; at the event, where she was accompanied by her rapper boyfriend Kiernan &ldquo;AKA&rdquo; Forbes.Last week, Somizi told host Anele Mdoda on her SABC3 Real Talk with Anele, Bonang owed her an apology after their fallout last year, but refused to dwell on the details.According to sources, at the Polo, Queen B requested to be moved to another lounge.Sources said Queen B, who turned heads in a skimpy purple number, arrived in Cape Town with AKA, followed by their camera crew who are shooting her upcoming reality show.But many were not surprised when Bonang asked to be removed from where social media influencers and other celebs &ndash; such as her alleged former BFF SomG &ndash; were located.This allegedly happened hardly minutes after she entered the marquee.&ldquo;She nicely asked to be moved into another marquee as Somizi was sitting there. Whatever Queen B wants she gets. She made it clear Somizi wouldn&rsquo;t feature in her reality show, not even as an extra,&rdquo; said the source.&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t breathe the same air and don&rsquo;t even greet each other. It&rsquo;s like they were never friends.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange because, As friends, we&rsquo;re caught in the middle of it,&rdquo; said another source.Both Somizi and Bonang could not be reached for comment.Jay Sibanda from DNA, Bonang&rsquo;s management, said Bonang is overseas and wouldn&rsquo;t comment on the matter.
