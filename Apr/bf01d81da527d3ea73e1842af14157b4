Highlands striker Collins Mbesuma could feature against former club Orlando Pirates in Tembisa on Saturday night after recently returning from a long-term injury.A full strength and increasingly confidentv Pirates side head to the Makhulong Stadium to do battle with relegation-threatened Highlands Park, 20H15 kick-off on Saturday night.In midweek action, Pirates beat Maritzburg United 2-0 to end a 12-match winless streak in the league, while the Lions of the North missed a host of chances in their 0-1 defeat away at Ajax Cape Town. Those results left Highlands bottom of the standings, while Bucs are ninth, although only six points clear of Saturday's opponents. The Buccaneers have also advanced to the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals, although head coach Kjell Jonevret is cautious to jump the gun when asked if his side has rediscovered their optimal form. "We were a little all over in the beginning but I think we've found the recipe of that they know what to do," he was quoted saying by&nbsp;KickOff. "But if we can do that every week [the win over Maritzburg] it'll be better. At least right now, I hope that the players feel that we are happy again, but it's difficult to say [if Bucs have turned the corner]."They have been tough games for us, we played many of the top teams and now we are playing teams around us," he added.Highlands Park head coach Gordon Igesund is starting to run out of time to save the PSL rookies from relegation.He does at least have seasoned striker Mbesuma back in the mix after the Zambian made an appearance off the bench against Ajax to mark the end of a nearly four-month injury absence. Both Igesund and Mbesuma were formerly at Pirates.The Tembisa-based side have lost two and won two of their last four league matches. They are only two points from safety, with seven matches to play.Neither team has any suspensions, and apart from Thabo Rakhale and Thabo Qalinge who are still making their way back from injury for Pirates, both coaches should have full strength teams.The first round league encounter ended 2-2.
