THINGS might be falling apart in the National First Division for Jomo Cosmos, but they are having the time of their lives in the Nedbank Cup. Ezenkosi are like a fish out of water in their league campaign, but they are hitting all the right buttons in Africa&rsquo;s richest cup competition. Ezenkosi claimed a big scalp when they stunned Bidvest Wits 5-4 on penalties to advance to the next stage. Goalkeeper Lesego Modiba was the hero as he saved two penalties by Cuthbert Malajila and Sfiso Nhlati. Cosmos are eight in the league and don&rsquo;t look like they will return to the Premiership this season,but Ezenkosi produced one of the best results of the last 16 stages at Tsakane Stadium last night to send Premiership heavy weights Wits packing to book a spot in Ke Yona quarterfinal. Cosmos defied the odds to eliminate one of the form teams in the country at the moment. Linda Mntambo&rsquo;s first half stoppage time goal was cancelled out by Mogakolodi Ngele midway through the second half. The Clever Boys defeated National First Division outfit Cape Town All Stars 2-0 in the Mother City, while Ezenkosi drubbed 3-0 third tier minnows Rovers United at the same venue to get to this stage of the competition. The Clever Boys edged Ezenkosi 1-0 in a league game in the 2015/216 season in Potchefstroom in their last official meeting, but Ezenkosi got their measure of revenge this time. Cosmos were relegated that season as Wits finished in second place. In their last 14 meetings, Wits won five matches, lost three and drew six matches. Ezenkosi gave Wits a good run for their money in the first half as they kept their defense on their toes. Ezenkosi asked all the questions as the Clever Boys battled throughout the opening half. It didn&rsquo;t happen for Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s boys as they struggled to find their rhythm in an unforgettable game and Cosmos were full value for their win in the lottery.
