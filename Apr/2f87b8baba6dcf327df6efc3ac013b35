Dear MizzBMy 15 year-old son is abusing drugs and alcohol and he is skipping school. My husband left our home and moved in with a neighbour down the road and does not support his kids.But we always see him with plastic bags full of groceries on his way to our neighbour&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;Please help me save my son.Dear MomYou are doing a great job taking care of your children after your husband walked out. Your son&rsquo;s drug problem is probably a symptom of inner conflict. He may be using drugs to avoid feelings of sadness. It is important not to insult your husband because your son might take it personally. Reassure your children that they are not to blame for their father&rsquo;s actions. Organise counselling sessions for your kids so they can learn how to cope with the painful situation they are going through.
