MANY people think taxi drivers are uneducated and illiterate. But Joe Ndhlovu has proved them wrong. The 38-year-old taximan from Soshanguve, Tshwane, graduated with a diploma in public management from the Tshwane University of Technology on Wednesday. He told Daily Sun he had always had a dream to one day see himself in a graduation grown with a diploma in his hand. He said the journey wasn&rsquo;t easy, but he got to his goal through dedication and hard work. Joe said driving a taxi wasn&rsquo;t an easy job but it was the only way he could pay his fees. He passed matric in 2001 and enrolled at the university in 2003 but he had to drop out because of financial problems.&ldquo;I decided to become a full-time taxi driver because it was a way to earn money. &ldquo;Although it took me over 10 years to raise enough money to go back to school, I wasn&rsquo;t discouraged.&rdquo; Joe said he went back to university in 2014 but found the curriculum had changed and he had to add an extra two years to his studies to graduate. &ldquo;After I went back to college I realised the money I had saved wasn&rsquo;t going to be enough, so I had to juggle my studies and driving taxis.&ldquo;But it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.&rdquo;Joe reached out to his friends on social media.&ldquo;I received a helping hand from Ruben Serumula, who paid off all my debt. I plan to continue driving a taxi until I get another job,&rdquo; he said.
