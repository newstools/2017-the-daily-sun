RESIDENTS of this small town are angry.The people of Colchester, Eastern Cape claim their municipality is not maintaining the local graveyard.They said some graves were sinking while others had been vandalised because the cemetery has no fence. Madala Thamsanqa Maseti (67) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The cemetery is very old. It is part of our heritage because our elders are buried there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of our culture to respect the dead, but our cemetery is in a bad state.&rdquo; Thamsanqa, who lives near the cemetery, said it is worse when it rains.&ldquo;People battle to bury their loved ones when it rains. Overgrown grass is also a problem at the graveyard. &ldquo;Snakes and other reptiles dominate the place.&ldquo;The municipality must urgently send workers to clean the cemetery.&ldquo;This problem has been going on for a long time, and it&rsquo;s difficult for mourners to bury their relatives.&rdquo;Another resident,who only identified herself as Plaatjies said &ldquo;The state of the graves is not good.This shows that we don&rsquo;t care about our dead.I have two family members who we buried there a few years ago.It upsets me that I live everyday with the reality that their graves are in that condition.If I was employed I would secure their graves by erecting a strong boundary wall around the graves.We even struggled to locate their graves last year when we were holding a traditional ritual for them.We are just desperate that the municipality repair the cemetery because it means a lot for the people of Colchester.We have sentimental memories for our relatives who are laid there.&rdquo; Godfrey Jacobs (30), a former ward committee member, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The condition of the cemetery is not good at all.&ldquo;We have been telling the municipality that we cannot bury our people at the graveyard.&ldquo;The previous municipal leaders once brought a contractor to maintain the graveyard, but he left without saying anything to the community.&rdquo;&ldquo;We have even raised the matter with mayor Athol Trollip, and he promised to send a team to investigate.&ldquo;There was also a time when metal crosses were stolen from the graves. That&rsquo;s the reason we asked the municipality to put a fence around the cemetery.&rdquo;Mthubanzi Mniki, spokesman for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, said: &ldquo;The public health department in the municipality is currently talking to the human settlements directorate and the South African National Parks about the availability of land for burials. &ldquo;A meeting will be organised with the residents of Colchester to report back to them. &ldquo;The matter is on the priority list of deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani,who is also the mayoral committee chairman for public health.&rdquo;
