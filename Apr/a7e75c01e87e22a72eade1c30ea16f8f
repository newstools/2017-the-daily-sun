WHEN a thug offered residents fencing wire he had stolen from the construction site of a nearby bridge, residents jumped at the opportunity to get a bargain. A number of people from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, rushed to buy building material and took out their last cents. But the long arm of the law ended up finding them. Today, two men and a woman are in prison after being found in possession of material believed to have been stolen from the N17 footbridge. When the cops arrived at the suspects&rsquo; shacks on Friday, they found they had used the stolen wire to fence off their yards. They ended up learning the hard way that buying stolen goods is nothing but trouble. KwaThema police spokesman Captain Thabo Sibuyi said the wire was recovered after a tip-off.&ldquo;Police proceeded to an address where they found a 28-year-old woman who named the 22-year-old man she had bought the wire from. &ldquo;Another man with the same fence was approached and confirmed he had bought the material from the accused and his partner,&rdquo; said Sibuyi. About 200 metres of wire was recovered, which the police returned to the rightful owner. The alleged seller and two buyers were arrested and charged. The three appeared in the Springs Magistrates Court on Monday and the matter was postponed to find legal representation. The woman was detained at Joburg Prison while the two men were taken to Modderbee Prison. A case of theft was opened at KwaThema Police Station.
