AS the Easter long weekend begins, Metro cops have vowed to crack down on drivers who don&rsquo;t obey the rules of the road.Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said they will be conducting stop-and-search operations and checking for illegal drugs, weapons, and unroadworthy and overloaded vehicles. Speed cameras will be placed at places of entertainment and motorists who stop on the highway to pick up passengers will be arrested.&ldquo;The influx of people in and out of Gauteng puts a massive strain on law enforcement agencies,&rdquo; said Minnaar.He said it was a period characterised by driver intolerance, manifesting in reckless and negligent driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and speeding. Vehicle fitness was important, as many vehicles had worn out tyres and faulty brakes.There was a 46% decline in road deaths last Easter compared with the previous year.&ldquo;But these figures cannot be celebrated, because one death on the road is one death too many,&rdquo; said Minnaar.Studies indicate that the chance of causing an accident doubles after only a single drink. Six out of 10 drivers who die in accidents have dangerously high alcohol levels in their blood. An investigation into substance abuse indicated that 50% of truck drivers and 30% of taxi drivers involved in accidents had been drinking. Citizens are urged to report incidents of misconduct to the toll-free number 0860 400 800.
