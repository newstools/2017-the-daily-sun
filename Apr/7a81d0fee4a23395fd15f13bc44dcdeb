ARTHUR Mafokate is done with music and is allegedly clearing all traces thereof out of his life.&nbsp;Sunday Sun recently published an article, in which the Sika Lekhekhe hitmaker revealed that he was about to quit the music industry.And this massive clean-up exercise has extended to the retired King of Kwaito&rsquo;s roll of musicians. They were handed clearances to seek refuge at new record labels.But former employees at 999 Music, the now defunct record label owned by Arthur, were more worried about the well-being of Cici, real name Busisiwe Thwala (28), the stable&rsquo;s main artist.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that things had to end like this between them. Arthur&rsquo;s music business has taken a knock,&rdquo; claimed the first source.&ldquo;Arthur tried to recreate his last best artist, Chomee, through Cici. But the plan to get back at Chomee was always flawed, hence it didn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;According to a second source, Cici has moved back in with her sister Sannah in Durban, KZN.&ldquo;Cici made the mistake of relying too much on Arthur,&rdquo; the insider said.&ldquo;Before she came to Jozi, she was dating a doctor who stayed in Westville, Durban. But she dumped the guy, who was really supportive of her career when she had no record label contract.&rdquo;The source claimed Cici&rsquo;s story should serve as a lesson to the musician: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s now jobless and only has her clearance. This is her wake-up call.&rdquo;When called for comment, Arthur said he was in a meeting and should be called later. But he failed to answer our calls. Cici could not be reached for comment.
