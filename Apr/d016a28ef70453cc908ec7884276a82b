Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has urged his players to build on their victory over West Ham United as they aim to finish the season on a high.The Gunners were without a win in their last three Premier League games before cruising past the Hammers 3-0 at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday.Despite the win, Arsenal remain four points outside the top four and Wenger knows they need to keep bagging three points in their upcoming games to challenge for a UEFA Champions League spot."West Ham defended well in the first half and we needed to find a solution in the second half. We were convincing after the break," he told&nbsp;BBC Sport."We come out of a difficult period and our confidence goes quickly and comes back slowly. We are in the final sprint in the Premier League. Consistency will be very important."We have a little handicap on the points front. We have fewer possibilities to drop points."
