Former Orlando Pirates defender Ronnie "Mainline" Zondi believes Kjell Jonevret can endear himself to the team's faithful by winning the Nedbank Cup.The 54-year-old Sweden-born coach, who took over the Pirates hotseat in February, has been tasked to guide the team to a respectable position this season - &nbsp;but with no pressure to perform miracles for the Soweto giants at this late stage of the season.In three league matches and one knock-out tie, Jonevret has managed three draws and one win. The coach's first victory at Bucs came in a form of a 3-1 win over Second Division side EC Bees in the Nedbank Cup Last 32 three weeks back.But the Swedish mentor will be gunning for his debut Premiership victory when battling it out with relegation-threatened Free State Stars in a crucial league encounter at James Motlatsi Stadium on Saturday at 6pm.&nbsp;Bucs will take on the same team seven days later in their Nedbank Cup Last 16 clash at the same venue."It's true that Jonevret is not under pressure to do wonders for Pirates at this stage of the season, since he took over at a later stage," Zondi exclusively told Vodacom Soccer."But, the fact is that Bucs' supporters are hard to please, they are die-hards of South African football."The Bucs' faithful may have already come to terms with the team's slip-up in the league title race, but it's an undeniable fact that they are desperate to see their beloved team clinch the Nedbank Cup to end a turbulent season on a high." Jonevret, who won a league and cup double during his tenure at Swedish giants Djurgardens in 2005, indicated on his appointment, on February 20, that to restore things at the Buccaneers "it will require patience because it is no quick fix", he was quoted by the media as saying."Yes, it will require patience for him to change the team's fortunes, but he must have already realised by now that Pirates is not an ordinary team, but a title-chasing team.&nbsp;"Yes, a top-six finish may be OK for him and team's management this season, but come next season the expectations are likely to be even higher.&nbsp;"So, the man can endear himself to the Bucs' faithful a little bit earlier than expected by winning this only remaining cup, the Nedbank Cup," added Zondi.
