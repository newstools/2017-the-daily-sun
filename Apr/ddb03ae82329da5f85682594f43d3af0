REPORTS have surfaced that President Jacob Zuma, one of his sons, former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe and the Guptas&rsquo; names have appeared on a hit list. Eskom board chairman Ben Ngubane was also on the list seized from a 33-year-old suspect arrested by the Hawks in Midrand, northern Joburg on Wednesday. The Hawks have refused to reveal the names of other ministers and prominent South Africans also on the list. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said all will be revealed when the suspect appears in the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg today. He has been charged with plotting to kill cabinet members. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you names right now. All will be revealed when we go to court. Some think we are just being malicious by making this public but this man has made serious threats against very prominent people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is OK in the head. He is not mad. There is nothing wrong with him. There is a lot involved and people are going to be shocked with what will come out in court.&rdquo;Mulaudzi said there were 23 names on the list and the Hawks would be opposing bail to enable them to investigate the case further. According to the Hawks, the suspect is the co-founder of organisations known as the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance and the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalist Regime. He didn&rsquo;t want to reveal whether the suspect had received money for his project.The man, described as highly intelligent by the Hawks, was apparently bust by undercover cops while trying to get funds from potential donors. Ngubane told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I am unaware of the threat in question but the baseless accusations about corruption can result in security threats. Otherwise, I have confidence in our relevant authorities to deal with the matter.&rdquo;
