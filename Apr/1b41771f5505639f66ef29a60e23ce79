COPS are hunting for a snake inyanga accused of killing his neighbour&rsquo;s wife . Musa &ldquo;Mkhulu&rdquo; Zulu (34) was famous in Alexandra, northern Joburg, for healing patients with snakes, but he disappeared without a trace after Connie Khosa (30) was shot on Thursday. Connie&rsquo;s husband, Sheppard Baloyi, told Daily Sun there was a fight after Musa accused Connie of making his wife sick. &ldquo;He claimed Connie had been involved in evil things and if his wife died, he would come and kill her,&rdquo; said Sheppard. He said Musa&rsquo;s wife died last Saturday. Sheppard claimed: &ldquo;Musa came to our house and said he would not allow my wife to continue living. He shot her but missed and she knelt down and started praying. But the bullets suddenly started raining down on her. She was shot nine times and died instantly.&ldquo;I ran to the police station and Zulu chased me. I managed to jump into a taxi, which took me to Alexandra Police Station.&rdquo; Alex police spokesman Captain Allie Kodisang said the cops were looking for Musa in connection with the killing. &ldquo;He is suspected to be in KZN and police are appealing to anyone with information to call Constable Bheki Mhlongo on 082 345 1141, Sergeant Bongani Mbonani on 082 436 5529 or 011 321 7600, or to approach the nearest police station,&rdquo; he said.
