KWAZULU-NATAL MEC for Arts and Culture, Bongi Sithole-Moloi, was booed by gospel fans before she even got on stage.Bongi attended the third annual Kufeziwe Gospel Celebration as a VIP guest at Umhlathuze Sport Complex, in Richards Bay, KZN on Easter Sunday.The mayor of UMhlathuze Municipality, Mduduzi Mhlongo, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to introduce a special guest, who also made this event possible. I&rsquo;m talking about the MEC for Arts and Culture, Bongi Sithole Moloi. "She&rsquo;ll come on stage and greet you all.&rdquo; But the crowd screamed and booed before she even appeared."&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect this behaviour from Christians,&rdquo; said Mduduzi, and left the stage without calling the MEC.Dudu Khoza of Ukhozi FM, who was also the MC, also tried her luck with the crowd. She called the MEC on stage and again the crowd became unruly. One gospel fan shouted: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not here for politics.&rdquo;The visibly irritated MEC, said: &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re rejecting me simply because I&rsquo;m from Nquthu.&rdquo;Despite this, the crowd continued to boo her.&nbsp;She defended herself, saying: &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to say this, but I&rsquo;m being provoked here. A blessed nation is one that respects its own.&rdquo;At that moment, Dudu asked the crowd to be respectful. &ldquo;Can you please be respectful,&rdquo; Dudu said, but the crowd was uncontrollable and screamed on top of their voices.The MEC left the stage in a huff.After she left, the crowd started enjoying the music.Event organiser, Jabulani Bhengu, said he was not at the event when the MEC got booed.&ldquo;I heard about it and I was disappointed. People should learn to respect leaders,&rdquo; said Jabulani.Spokesperson for the Department of Arts and Culture in KZN Max Makhathi requested us to send an email on Friday but failed to respond.
