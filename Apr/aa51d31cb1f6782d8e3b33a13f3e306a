IT was one golden moment for the Eastern Cape rugby fanatics when three rugby matches were presented to them in one day &ndash; an unforgettable family day.And not only was the inaugural SuperSport Rugby Challenge fever, but there was also the Gold Cup qualifier where African Bombers played Port Elizabeth&rsquo;s Harlequins at the Wolfson Stadium in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage yesterday.The Harlequins ran riot against the out of sorts Bombers who looked to have just honoured the fixture &ndash; only to recover minutes before the final bell could go off with three tries.There was that enthralling moment before the end of the match as the Bombers wanted to play catch up but it was already too late, as the Harlequins won the match 45-34 in a nail-biting finale.The Harlequins kicked off the scintillating day of rugby by slotting in the first try within five minutes into the game after Dale Nel made himself a serious nuisance when he jumped over the try line.&nbsp;Making matters worse is that 26 minutes into the game, then the Harlequins were leading 23-6 after big man Austin Fredericks also made it over the line, for his teammate Roger Louis to make the all important conversion. At the time the Bombers only score two penalties with Siyabonga Ngcaba making all the kicks.&nbsp;Both teams went to the break with &lsquo;Quins leading 25-6 after Louis also put up his name with a try for the local side.&nbsp;The Harlequins were surely running away with the game having gone 42-6 twenty minutes into the second half to the excitement of the fans.But surely the Harlequins fans were left on the edge of their seats biting their tongues in the 77th minute, as Bombers wouldn&rsquo;t allow being bombed out without a serious fight.Bathandwa Cafu, Siyabonga Ngcaba, Luvuyo Ngxeba and Unathi Diamond recorded their names in the scoreboard of try scorers for the Bombers but their contribution was a bit too little, too late. &nbsp; SunSport is official media partners to the SuperSport Rugby Challenge &nbsp;
