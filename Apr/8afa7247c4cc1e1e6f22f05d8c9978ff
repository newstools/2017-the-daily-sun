Bloemfontein Celtic will be looking to extend their six-match unbeaten run when they host Kaizer Chiefs in a Premiership affair at the Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday.Siwelele are currently on a roll having reached the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals and also eased their relegation fears in recent weeks.Celtic are up to 11th on the league standings after winning one and drawing two of their last three league games, with 23 points from 22 matches.Amakhosi, third in the table and three points off the league summit, have hit a splendid run of their own having last lost a match in early December last year.Chiefs have won eight out of their past 12 games, drawing the other four, to stay in the title hunt, and coach Steve Komphela believes the crunch part of the season still lies ahead."It is all about recovery, rest and pre-match practice," said Komphela. "It is a critical phase of the league. I am happy, so far so good."Brilliant Khuzwayo remains out injured for Komphela's side, but Lewis Macha could return, along with Tsepo Masilela and George Lebese.Phunya Sele Sele have not reported any fresh injuries for the clash.
