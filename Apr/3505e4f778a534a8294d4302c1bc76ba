FIRST the tokoloshe stole his underpants and now it has taken the only valuable thing he owns. Zuluboy Mabaso (36) from Thokoza, Ekurhuleni, says the supernatural creature stole his matric certificate! &ldquo;I completed my matric in 2000. I didn&rsquo;t get the best results but I had the certificate,&rdquo; he said. Zuluboy said the certificate used to hang in the rented backroom where he lives and every time he looked at it he was reminded of his days at school. &ldquo;But now it is no more. The jealous tokoloshe took it on Monday,&rdquo; he said. Zuluboy, who is originally from KZN, said he was certain the tokoloshe was responsible because it often took his belongings. &ldquo;It started by taking my underpants, then it took my money and now it has made off with my one and only certificate. &ldquo;When it comes I see it but I can&rsquo;t catch it. Last time it came wearing my red Jockey underpants. It was staring at the certificate on the wall and the next thing I knew, it had disappeared. All I need is someone who can help me track down this tokoloshe so I can get my certificate back. It can keep the underpants.&rdquo; Zuluboy said he has not been able to find a decent job since he left school. &ldquo;I did some part-time jobs here and there but they never lasted. I was still hoping to get a good job with this certificate.&rdquo; Sangoma Jabulani Mthimkhulu said Zuluboy was being followed by bad luck in the form of a tokoloshe. &ldquo;It terrorises him. If nothing is done he will lose his mind,&rdquo; he said.
