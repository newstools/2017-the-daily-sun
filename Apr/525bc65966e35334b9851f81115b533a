WHILE other matric teachers are teaching pupils during the holidays, teachers at Laduma High School in KwaMpumuza, Pietermaritzburg have decided to stay at home.This comes after the killing of an acting principal at the school about three weeks ago. Priscilla Mchunu (55) was shot dead by two men while teaching in her classroom. Thabiso Ndabezitha (39), chairman of the school governing body, said matric teachers have made it clear that they won&rsquo;t risk their lives by coming to school during the holidays.&ldquo;We have agreed that they should stay at home for safety reasons. We don&rsquo;t expect them to come to school when we cannot protect them,&rdquo; said Ndabezitha.He said what&rsquo;s even worse is that the culprits are still at large.Kwazi Mthethwa, spokesman for the KZN Education Department, said they have asked the police to patrol near the school.&ldquo;Knowing that the culprits are still at large, we&rsquo;d like to urge our teachers to remain vigilant, and to report any suspicious people to the police. We ask them to remain calm and put their faith in the cops,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.
