SOUTH African Communist Party deputy secretary Jeremy Cronin has called for the Gupta family&rsquo;s citizenship to be revoked and for them to face a judicial inquiry.Cronin was speaking during the memorial service for the late veteran Ahmed Kathrada at St George&rsquo;s Cathedral in Cape Town yesterday.&ldquo;We call for the revoking of citizenship and residential rights of the Guptas,&rdquo; he said, to people&rsquo;s cheers. Cronin has asked for the family&rsquo;s lifestyle to also be audited. He accused the Guptas of capturing the state and being the cause of the problems faced by South Africa today. Cronin said President Jacob Zuma had already made the decision to sack Pravin Gordhan last year.&ldquo;The president told close officials his relationship with Gordhan was irretrievably broken back in November last year.&rdquo; When the former minister of finance arrived at the memorial, he was given a hero&rsquo;s welcome. Gordhan said the ANC government must implement the radical transformation for the benefit of every South African, not just a few. Speaking of the downgrade, Gordhan said: &ldquo;We shall overcome it. We did not need it but got it because of bad behaviour.&rdquo;Among those at the memorial were the late Kathrada&rsquo;s widow, Barbara Hogan, Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba and former Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom.
