IT was month end and Nophelo Ngqiba (41) bought a chicken from their regular vendor to prepare for her family. Her daughter cooked the meat, dished up as usual and shared some of it with their neighbours. Now two kids are dead and three adults have fallen ill.&nbsp; Family and neighbours couldn&rsquo;t explain what happened because not everyone who ate the chicken fell ill. The drama unfolded in Samora Machel, close to Cape Town on Sunday. &ldquo;We always buy the chicken from the same vendor and have never been ill before. We usually share it with our neighbours,&rdquo; said the daughter. She said one of the kids, Asemahle (4) ate the chicken before joining his friends to play. &ldquo;He was fine but then fainted and died while playing. My father ate his portion and also got sick.&rdquo; She said a neighbour&rsquo;s kid, Anele (6) also ate the chicken. After he ate the meat, he went to a neighbour to ask her to shave his head. &ldquo;The neighbour brought him home and told us that he was sweating and felt dizzy. Anele said he was feeling cold and asked for a blanket, before he started vomitting.&rdquo; A neighbour rushed him to a nearby clinic but later he died there. Neighbour Phathuxolo Jikijela said she smelled the delicious chicken and took a plate of rice to get some meat, but only found gravy left.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ate some with my son and thirty minutes later I started to feel dizzy, hot and weak.&rdquo; Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;Police officials are investigating the incident in which two children died in Samora Machel.&rdquo; Western Cape Health Department&rsquo;s Darren Francis said: &ldquo;One female patient was discharged from Mitchell&rsquo;s Plain Hospital. A male has been kept for observation and another male, Mxolisi Mhaga (54), is currently in a critical condition at Groote Schuur Hospital.&rdquo; Nophelo was too shocked to speak to the media. She also ate some chicken but did not get sick.
