COMMUNITY members barged into Patience Batala&rsquo;s home and dragged her son outside, claiming he had stolen tyres . . .The 48-year-old mum told Daily Sun she was horrified when the mob, led by taximen, took an iron and burned her son Xolani (24) with it! &ldquo;They told me I should come and witness the death of &lsquo;my dog&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Patience, from Motsoaledi squatter camp, Soweto. Xolani said he was sleeping in his shack three weeks ago when he heard the sound of men&rsquo;s voices coming from outside his door. He said: &ldquo;I was with my girlfriend and I told her to tell them I wasn&rsquo;t home. &ldquo;But before she could finish unlocking the chain, the door was kicked into her face.&ldquo;They hit my girlfriend and dragged me outside. &ldquo;They accused me of stealing tyres from a taxi, tied my ankles with rope, and started beating me.&ldquo;A man went to his shack and came back with a hot iron. &ldquo;He burned my feet with it and they later took turns burning other parts of my body.&rdquo;He said the beating went on for hours because he refused to confess.Patience said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re afraid to open a case now because these people are taximen and might kill my family.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair because there are witnesses who spent the whole day with my son and they say he didn&rsquo;t take those tyres.&rdquo;
