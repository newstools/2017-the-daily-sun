BAROKA FC co-coach Milton Dlamini says their recent victories have brought them some relief as the pressure to survive the relegation axe mounts.Bakgaga registered their first win at home since they were promoted to the Premiership when they defeated Free State Stars 2-1 in a relegation battle at Peter Mokaba Stadium midweek. This was the second league victory in a row for Baroka, who defeated SuperSport United 1-0 a fortnight ago. The arrival of Dlamini to work with Kgoloko Thobejane seems to have solved many of the Limpopo based outfit&rsquo;s problems.Baroka visit Maritzburg United at Harry Gwala Stadium tomorrow (5pm) for another relegation dogfight. Talking to SunSport yesterday Dlamini said he came to the club to solve problems. He believes players are responding to their new strategy, which will ensure they dodge the axe.&ldquo;When I arrived the balance in defence and attack was off, but now we are slowly getting there," he said.&ldquo;Winning two games in a row doesn&rsquo;t mean we are safe, there&rsquo;s still a lot of work to do to get there. Another 12 points might see us safe.&rdquo;Bakgaga midfielder Jacky Motshekgwa added: &ldquo;The gap between 10th and 16th in the table is not big. That motivates us.&rdquo;
