OBED Montjane (30) used to be a player, with girlfriends coming and going through his door.But now the once passionate man from Hillbrow, Joburg, is as meek as a lamb. That is because whenever he gets intimate, he has visions of his lover turning into a lion, sending him running!&ldquo;The woman I&rsquo;m with just turns into lion. No one can poke a lion. I see a big lion that looks as if it will harm me if I don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; said Obed.He said he knows very well that the visions are not real but said someone is using muthi to chase away his lovers.&ldquo;The last time I poked was in December 2015.&rdquo;In March last year, Obed visited a sangoma who gave him muthi and told him to stay away from women for a year in order to be healed. &ldquo;I did as I was told. My probation ended last month and I tried again but the horror is still there. I went back to the sangoma but he has since died. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve come to Daily Sun. I desperately needs help.&rdquo;
