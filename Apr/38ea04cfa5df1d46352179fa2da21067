THE family of 30-year-old Jack Malatji is traumatised after he was killed by a scrap metal shredding machine on Thursday. The accident happened at a scrap yard in De Wildt, near Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane, while the victim and two colleagues were trying to move a pile of heavy iron sheets. Jack worked as a steel packer. Apparently, he fell into the machine without his colleagues noticing. By the time his colleagues realised what was going on, it was too late to save his life. Jack&rsquo;s brother Tom Malatji told Daily Sun most of his colleagues were coming back from lunch when they saw blood coming out of the machine.One of the men who was working with Jack said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice he was under the machine when I switched it on.&ldquo;When I put it off it was too late because his body was already inside with his head and leg missing.&rdquo; The manager of the scrapyard said he was heartbroken by what had happened and the company would help the family with funeral costs.A scrap metal shredder is a large machine that turns a car into a large bucket of scrap metal. The machine is often used for reducing the size of scrap metal, which comes to the depot in various sizes.
