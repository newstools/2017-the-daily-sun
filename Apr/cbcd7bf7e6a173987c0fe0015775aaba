Bidvest Wits will be gunning for all three points against Platinum Stars this weekend to further cement their place in the Premiership title race.The Clever Boys, who were recently knocked out of the CAF Champions League by Egyptian giants Al-Ahly 1-0 over two legs, head into this weekend's clash in second place on the PSL standings, just a point behind leaders Cape Town City - and with two games in hand.While they overcame Cape Town All Stars in the Nedbank Cup 2-0, Gavin Hunt's side were held to a 0-0 draw with Chippa United in their last league encounter.Stars, meanwhile, are currently in eighth place, and 13 points worse off than their opponents this weekend.They were successful in their CAF Confederations Cup tie though (a competition Wits have now dropped in to) after defeating Ugandan side Vipers, winning 3-2 on aggregate - and come into this tie on the back of a second-leg 3-1 victory.They were also successful in their Cup clash over AmaZulu, with a 3-2 result, that followed a three-match league winning run, to see them make some significant headway in their rise up the table after flirting with relegation.The two sides face off at the Bidvest Stadium in Johannesburg on Saturday, with kick-off set for 6:00pm.Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs says his side need to focus on the positives as they continue to fight for league honours.Ahead of this game he told SuperSport: "We need to go and get the league and it is hot up there. We have to look at the positives."We have just started to get a team together that in the league can compete."We are not just a top eight team anymore we are not trying to survive relegation. We are a team that is fighting to win things.&rdquo;Stars coach Cavin Johnson added that his side are ready for Wits after beating Botswana's Township Rollers 2-1 in a recent friendly match.He said: "Rollers has a strong team and they always give us a tough time, so this was good preparation for our upcoming games."I wanted to look at some of our players who are not normally in the starting line up."Sometimes when the ball falls for you properly, you are able to score goals. Even last year we were playing well but the ball didn&rsquo;t fall for us."It didn&rsquo;t go in the back of the net. It&rsquo;s falling for us now and we are putting it in the back of the net. We just hope that we continue with the same form."
