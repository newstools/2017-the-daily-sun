WHEN a suspect in the murder of Richmond deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa was taken in for questioning, her family thought they&rsquo;d finally know the truth. But the 36-year-old man was released on Wednesday. Thandazile (39) was found dead at her house in Ndaleni on Sunday night with a bullet wound to her head. It is not clear if she committed suicide or was killed by someone else. There were rumours that she had been fighting with a man shortly before her death.Her uncle, Zachariah Phoswa (50), said the family is still hurting. &ldquo;The release of the man adds more pain. &ldquo;When the police took him in for questioning on Monday we were hoping we would be able to get some answers as to what happened,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell the cops how to do their work. I guess we will have to wait for the police investigation to be completed.&rdquo; Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the suspect was released after two days of questioning due to a lack of evidence linking him to the death.He said the case is still being investigated. Thandazile&rsquo;s memorial service was held at Richmond Agricultural Hall yesterday and her funeral service will be held at Silahla Stadium tomorrow.She leaves behind a 16-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter.Her parents and two brothers died in a political killing in the same house in 1997.
