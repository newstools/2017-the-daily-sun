SUPERSPORT United&rsquo;s 19 match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end yesterday following a 1-0 defeat to bottom club Baroka FC in an Absa Premiership match played at Mbombela Stadium, Nelspruit.Baroka midfielder Phineas Matlakala scored the most important goal in the 57th minute to ease their relegation troubles.The defeat is a huge blow for SuperSport who were hoping to keep up with other title chasers Cape Town City and Bidvest Wits.The Tshwane giants have been on a roll this season in their bid to wrestle the league title away from champions Mamelodi Sundowns.Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s boys had only lost once prior to the match and their first defeat was at the hands of Platinum Stars who beat them by the same margin in Rustenburg on 24 August. Matsatsantsa A Pitori seems to struggle against the PSL rookies who held them to a 1-1 draw in the first round.Baroka, who are still rooted to the basement with 18 points, ended their winless run which saw coach Kgoloko Thobejane being demoted in January and replaced by Jacob Sakala only to be reinstated again in February as results were scarce.Baroka have now won three league games since they gained promotion to the top flight.Their last win was on 15 October last year when they beat title chasers Cape Town City 2-1 in the Mother City.The Limpopo based side approached the game with their heads held high having held Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs to a 2-2 draw in their last league match prior to the Fifa calendar break. SuperSport dominated the first half with a quick short passing game using the width of the pitch to launch their attack.But Baxter&rsquo;s players seems to have left their scoring boots at home as they fluffed plenty of scoring chances they created with Kingston Nkhatha being the main culprit.Although, United continued to pile pressure after the break, Baroka gained momentum relying on counter attack football to penetrate Supersport suspect defence lead by Morgan Gould.Their efforts finally paid off when Matlakala got the better of SuperSport defender Michael Boxall to unleash a thunderous shot past a bemused goalkeeper Reyaad Pieterse.&nbsp;
