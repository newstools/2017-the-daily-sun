THE SA track and field Senior Athletics Championships in Potchefstroom tomorrow and Saturday will see Mzansi&rsquo;s cream of the crop compete for top honours. Much hype surrounds this year&rsquo;s edition of the biggest competition on the SA athletics calendar due to the number of star runners set to feature at the event. Among prominent athletes taking part are Luvo Manyonga, Cornel Fredericks, Gift Leotlela, Clarence Munyai, Wenda Nel and Le Roux Hamman.Field events will feature Khotso Mokoena, Zarck Visser and Rushwal Samaai.Athletes have been sharing their excitement from Potchefstroom using the #fillupPotch hashtag on social media.The majority of SA&rsquo;s big-name athletes confirmed their participation at the championships at the Kenneth McArthur Stadium this weekend. Much will be expected from man of the moment, Olympic silver medallist Manyonga.The lanky long jumper wants to become the first athlete to register a 9m jump but will face tough competition from Mokoena, Visser and Samaai.Manyonga, who is coached by Neil Cornelius at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria, was oozing confidence at a press conference yesterday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident I can do a 9m jump &ndash; I know I can do it,&rdquo; Manyonga said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out there to improve my distance.&rdquo;Manyonga smashed the African record with a leap of 8,62m but is strongly tipped to break through the 9m barrier. He earned silver at both the Olympics and the African Senior championships last year and says he is tired of coming in second: &ldquo;I want gold. I know I will get it.&rdquo;What will certainly drive Manyonga to excel is his public confession last month that he is dealing with the drug addiction he has battled for many years. He will be out to silence any critics this weekend.Manyonga has since enrolled himself in an aftercare rehabilitation programme to help him achieve his dream of becoming one of the world&rsquo;s greatest long jumpers.
