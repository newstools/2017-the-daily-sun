More than 2 000 people attended the rally. Pityana said: &ldquo;We put this government into power in 1994. We demand that Zuma go now!&ldquo;Even the veterans and some ANC leaders say so, and alliance partners Cosatu and SACP support the call. We will not tolerate a leader who is corrupt. The ruling party has the power to remove him. In his speech during his R8 million birthday party the president said he is ready to step down if the ANC recalls him.&rdquo;Former judge Zak Yacoob also slammed Zuma. He said: &ldquo;We need leaders with vision to save the ANC and the country.&rdquo;
