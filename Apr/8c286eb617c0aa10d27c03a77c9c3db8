IT IS rare to find Mamelodi Sundowns having gone six league matches WITHOUT victory, conceding four goals in the process.This turn of events has put pressure on everyone in the Brazilians camp, including fragile coach Pitso Mosimane. The coach has been in a fighting mood lately, clashing with Kaizer Chiefs security officials and, more recently, Gordon Masondo of Golden Arrows.But the pressure is understandable, as Mosimane has built an empire in Chloorkop, winning the Caf Champions League and the Super Cup, not forgetting the PSL title claimed last year.The question now is when will Sundowns return to winning ways and stop causing headaches and high blood pressure for their supporters?Fans hope this happens when they face the lethal SuperSport United in a Tshwane derby at Loftus Versfeld on Thursday (6pm).SunSport has learnt Mosimane might stop gambling with Kennedy Mweene, who has been letting in goals like a sieve.SunSport has discovered that trusted Denis Onyango has started training with the squad and is no longer doing it alone.&ldquo;Onyango trained with reserves last week but had a bit of pain. He was given given enough time to recuperate and is now back to his old self. &ldquo;The coach might throw him in against SuperSport,&rdquo; said SunSport&rsquo;s club informant.Their goal drought saw Downs knocked out of the Nedbank Cup 1-0 by Arrows following a shocking 0-0 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic and a 2-1 loss to Amakhosi in the league.Mosimane must be worried &ndash; time is running out for his team with the draw for the Caf Champions League fast approaching.The draw for the Champions League group phase will be held at the Caf headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, on 26 April, where 16 teams will drawn in four groups of four.In the group stage, each group will play matches on a home-and-away round-robin basis. The winners and runners-up of each group will advance to the quarterfinals.
