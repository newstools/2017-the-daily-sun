AFTER her catering business failed, Kate Makunyane did not give up. The 46-year-old from Atteridgeville, west of Tshwane, tried her hand at selling boiled eggs and ice cold water to motorists at intersections.&ldquo;My friends tried to discourage me, saying it was a man&rsquo;s job and that I would be run over by the cars,&rdquo; said Kate.But she ignored them and went ahead with her plans. &ldquo;I became popular within days. Curious residents would come to the intersection to watch me doing a job usually associated with young boys.&rdquo;Kate said she was the centre of attention.&ldquo;People were amused because they think women can&rsquo;t manoeuvre their way through traffic. I have proven them all wrong.&rdquo; She wakes up at 5am every day to boil eggs and pack her frozen water bottles.&ldquo;After 10am, I go back home to fetch more iced water and boiled eggs.&rdquo; Taxi driver Malesela Kwakwa (27) said Kate is an inspiration. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not lazy. I always tell my women passengers that this is a great example of a hardworking woman. &ldquo;Women should work for themselves and stop depending on blessers and sugar daddies to survive.&rdquo;
