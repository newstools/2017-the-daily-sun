 THE month of May makes me very miserable. This is the cry of a thwasa who lost her connection with the ancestors almost a decade ago. Phumla Khohleni (57), from Motherwell NU29 in Port Elizabeth, told Daily Sun: My life is a mess. I have been a thwasa since May 2008. I thought my ancestors would guide me but as soon as I started training as a sangoma I lost my connection with them. Since that day in May I have only had nightmares and have been robbed of a previously good life. Phumla believes she has been cursed and needs help to get her life back on track. In May 2010 I was evicted from my house. In May the following year my father died, and in May 2015 my mum died, she said. Phumla said she had consulted four sangomas but no one had helped her. I slaughtered seven goats to please my ancestors. I have spent more than R50 000 trying to get connected with my ancestors but they re still not communicating with me. However, she admitted to working at Home Affairs where she was found guilty of fraud, leading to a relative cursing her. I worked for Home Affairs between 1986 and 1997 and was fired after fraudulently receiving a relative s child support grant. What haunts me is that my relative said I would never get my pension because I stole from an innocent child. To this day the money has not been paid out. Eastern Cape Traditional Healers chairman Joe Dlamini said Phumla is a powerful sangoma, but she has been cursed by a jealous mentor. Home Affairs spokesman Siya Majakajaka confirmed that Phumla left the department in 1997.
