He was interested in what I was doing on my show.&nbsp;&ldquo;I hooked up with a few people close to him to understand what he was looking for because he wanted to bring me on board,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Da Kruk added that the Beat London slot meant a lot to him and his craft as a DJ.&nbsp;He said, about the overseas gig: &ldquo;On the slot, I&rsquo;m doing a South African house music news segment. I feel honoured and have put a lot of hard work into my craft.&nbsp;&ldquo;My fans shouldn&rsquo;t get it twisted &ndash; as I&rsquo;m showcasing what&rsquo;s out in the streets of Mzansi and London as far as the house music scene is concerned,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m in the forefront of narrating the South African music scene on this show.&nbsp;&ldquo;On the show, I&rsquo;m working to give the world a South African perspective on the house music scene,&rdquo; said DJ Da Kruk.&nbsp;&ldquo;And that also comes with a huge responsibility for me to sell Mzansi well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
