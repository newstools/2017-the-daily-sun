AWARD-WINNING rapper Emtee is said to be joining GauTV.According to sources, the rapper, real name Mthembeni Ndevu, will host his own show.Insiders say they want to bring him on board as he&rsquo;s popular. One source said Emtee was not invited for auditions.&ldquo;This is a business decision to push for more viewers. It&rsquo;s nothing to do with talent,&rdquo; the source said.The source added that GauTV is a new channel and will keep viewers glued to the small screen.&nbsp;&ldquo;For a new channel, this is expected of them, but they mustn&rsquo;t hold auditions, giving young people false hope if they already know who they&rsquo;ll hire.&rdquo;Another source said it&rsquo;s no surprise for GauTV to bring Emtee on board because even Candy Tsa Mandebele has her own show, but on the day of the auditions she wasn&rsquo;t present. For her part, Candy said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re talking about. I signed my contract with GauTV last year.&rdquo;Emtee said it&rsquo;s not confirmed yet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still in the pipeline. I can&rsquo;t say much as it&rsquo;s a concept,&rdquo; he said.Said the second mole: &ldquo;They had two days for auditions and on both days I was there and I didn&rsquo;t see Candy. Those who were there were young talented people who wanted a chance. It&rsquo;s pointless to hold auditions if you know who you want for the show.&rdquo;&nbsp;When asked about the auditions, he said: &ldquo;This show is my concept, if everything comes together and it is approved then I&rsquo;ll talk about it. I&rsquo;m an overall artist, I can be a presenter&rdquo;GauTV&rsquo;s Venia Tshidumo confirmed Emtee would join the channel.&ldquo;Yes, I can confirm Emtee will be joining the channel. It&rsquo;s true he didn&rsquo;t attend any auditions. We had a concept and he was the perfect candidate. We headhunted him. It&rsquo;s true, Candy didn&rsquo;t attend any auditions as she was with us in the journey of the channel going for 24 hours. We had already spoken to her.&ldquo;Yes, we had auditions and hired people. They started as field reporters on 1 March,&rdquo; said Venia.
