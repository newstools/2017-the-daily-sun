THE Easter holidays are just around the corner. And taximen will be required to get temporary permits in order to ferry passengers on long-distance trips. This will prevent their vehicles from being confiscated!The transport department said on Friday that taximen travelling outside Gauteng over the holidays must get permits to operate outside their usual provincial routes.The permits are the result of an agreement between the Legislature, the South African Council of Churches, and taximen in the province.Legislature roads and transport portfolio committee chairman, Jacob Khawe, said they hoped the move would result in harmonious and peaceful taxi operations over Easters.The permits would be issued to legal operators only, and they had to apply to the department three days before leaving.Applicants had to produce the permit and a letter of request, which should be signed under oath.This should show:their destination;number of passengers;Purpose of trip; anddate of departure from and return to Gauteng.Taximan Sizwe Mkhize said he had started applying for a permit.&ldquo;If you want to be safe and don&rsquo;t want to get into trouble, you should prepare your permit,&rdquo; he told the People&rsquo;s Paper..&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already applied for mine, and so should all drivers who will be driving outside the province.&rdquo;Taximan Vusi Mtimande (34), who said he will be transporting church members to the yearly Zion Christian Church gathering in Moria, Limpopo, will also apply for a permit.&ldquo;Moria is in another province,&rdquo; he told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;I want to make sure my taxi is not impounded and will apply for the permit for the Easter weekend.&rdquo;
