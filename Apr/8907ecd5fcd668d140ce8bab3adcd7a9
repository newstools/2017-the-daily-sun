WHEN they saw Aphile Lushaba&rsquo;s body hanging in the room she shared with her mum, they expected to find a note.The family from Mayville transit camp in Durban thought she would have explained why she took her life at the age of 14. They still are wondering why she did it.Her uncle, Christopher Ngcobo (48) told Daily Sun he saw her just before she committed suicide on Sunday. &ldquo;I saw her before she killed herself as I live a few doors away. &ldquo;She looked all right to me. &ldquo;I even joked about the shoes she was wearing and we laughed. &ldquo;She showed no signs of anger or depression over anything troubling her or that she was unhappy about,&rdquo; said Christopher. When the SunTeam met her mum, Nomvula Lushaba (40) at the mortuary yesterday, she was unable to speak to us.Family member Rejoyce Lushaba (66) said the girl&rsquo;s mum was still devastated.&ldquo;She is a warm-hearted woman who loved her daughter. The mum is traumatised about her daughter taking her life like that and it looks as if it will take a while for her to accept it.&rdquo;A neighbour told the People&rsquo;s Paper Aphile&rsquo;s friends knew that she had said she was going to kill herself. &ldquo;They said when they asked her why, she would just laugh at them and never give a reason. &ldquo;They said they never believed she would do it,&rdquo; said the neighbour. Small kids, who had come to buy chips from her mum, found Aphile&rsquo;s body. They then called the neighbours and her uncle. The teenager was in grade 10 at Mayville High School. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest was being investigated by the Cato Manor cop shop after a 14-year-old girl was found hanging from the ceiling. &ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,&rdquo; said Gwala.
