IT SEEMS the heartbreak epidemic is in the air, and some of Mzansi&rsquo;s favourite celebrities are rumoured to have caught the bug. Said to be among the ill, is 5FM presenter Tumi Voster, who was allegedly recently dumped by DJ BlackCoffee&rsquo;s manager, Amaru da Costa.Said the first source: &ldquo;She&nbsp; actually thought Amaru was the man of her dreams. But she never expected to find out she was a makhwapheni&nbsp;all along. &ldquo;Not only was this a shock for her, it also stung. &ldquo;Imagine receiving news that the man you thought was your main &lsquo;bae&rsquo; was actually someone else&rsquo;s bae.&rdquo; A second source said the heartbreak would be severe &ldquo;due to most people in showbiz knowing&rdquo; about the duo&rsquo;s alleged affair. &ldquo;You can only imagine how embarrassing this saga was for her,&rdquo; the mole said.&ldquo;Phela , Amaru and Tshepiso got married on Saturday in a traditional ceremony held at a private venue.&rdquo;A third source said about the presenter of The Saturday Situation show at the radio station: &ldquo;She went to Thailand to nurse her broken heart. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t stand the fact that Tshepiso won Amaru&rsquo;s heart. She had to avoid the drama because even her friends knew about her affair with Amaru, so they were going to keep asking questions.&rdquo;A third source said this was perfect timing for Tumi to reflect on her life. &ldquo;When she left for Thailand, she was moody &ndash; because she was dumped for Tshepiso. It&rsquo;s so sad, yazi, for her to use a vacation to nurse her broken heart. Amaru is gone and will never be hers. She must just move on.&rdquo; The SunTeam could not get Tumi, Amaru and Tshepiso&rsquo;s comments. They all ignored our calls.
