DESPITE some confusion, the Save SA march to the Union Buildings has been granted permission to go ahead.&ldquo;We had our lawyers file an urgent application with the chief magistrate, setting out our efforts to obtain permission. She considered the application and overturned the prohibition,&rdquo; Save SA spokesmanMark Heywood told News24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said the organisation followed all procedures to get permission for the march to call for President Jacob Zuma to step down. &ldquo;I suspect some political interference. It looks like a wrong administrative decision was made.&rdquo;&nbsp; Save SA put out the following statement on its website:Tomorrow&nbsp; people&nbsp; in&nbsp; South&nbsp; Africa&nbsp; will&nbsp; be&nbsp; exercising&nbsp; their&nbsp; right&nbsp; to&nbsp; &ldquo;protest&nbsp; peacefully and&nbsp; unarmed&rdquo;&nbsp; in&nbsp; terms&nbsp; of&nbsp; section&nbsp; 17&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; Constitution.&nbsp; We assure&nbsp; you&nbsp; that&nbsp; the march on the Union Buildings complies fully with the Regulation of Gatherings Act and authorities have not refused permission.In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; we&nbsp; have&nbsp; been&nbsp; meeting&nbsp; with&nbsp; senior police officials all week on details and arrangements, in very productive and cordial meetings, and merely need to finalise a few&nbsp; minor&nbsp; administrative&nbsp; issues&nbsp; this&nbsp; morning&nbsp; such as bus routes to and from the demonstration.We must emphasise that this is a legal demonstration, and it would be unlawful for authorities to stop it!We encourage South Africans to continue with their preparations, gather their spirits and join us in Church Square from 10am tomorrow for this historic People&rsquo;s March to the Union Buildings at 12 noon.The people united will never be defeated!&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-save-sa-march-to-go-ahead-20170406&nbsp;
