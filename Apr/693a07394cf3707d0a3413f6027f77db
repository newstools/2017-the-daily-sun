THE drama that is said to be unfolding at Ukhozi FM is far from over, sources claim.&nbsp;Sunday Sun understands that Ukhozi FM programmes manager Zandile Tembe is allegedly at loggerheads with Woza Nabangani Bakho show producer, Sma Mathibeli.&nbsp;The alleged feud between the two ex-best friends is said to have emanated over money.&nbsp;Sources close to the frenemies told the People&rsquo;s Paper their fight started when Sma and her businessman husband Calvin of Calvin Family Group allegedly loaned money to Zandile.&nbsp;One source claimed the producer and her hubby loaned about R70&thinsp;000 to Zandile.&nbsp;She was allegedly having financial problems &ndash; her husband Sizwe Sifunda&rsquo;s business was not doing well.&nbsp;A well-placed source claims Zandile was struggling to pay back the loan, and she then started to victimise Sma at work.&nbsp;Another source claimed their fight forced Sma to resign from the station.&nbsp;&ldquo;They had to beg her to come back to work. But station manager Bonga Mpanza was alerted, and he got Sma to come back.&rdquo;&nbsp;The mole alleged: &ldquo;Zandile knows she&rsquo;s being investigated by the SABC and that Sma stands a chance of replacing her.&rdquo;&nbsp;When contacted for comment, Calvin didn&rsquo;t confirm the claims and asked to call his wife first.&nbsp;When called for comment, Zandile said: &ldquo;I have no comment.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sma said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Speak to my superiors.&rdquo;&nbsp;Ukhozi&rsquo;s station manager Bonga Mpanza said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comment on this issue.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sizwe was not available for comment.
