JOMO Cosmos hope to take their Nedbank Cup form into their National First Division (NFD) campaign. Jomo Sono has not given up hope on Ezenkosi&rsquo;s return to the Absa Premiership. Cosmos defeated Bidvest Wits 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw to book their place in the quarterfinals. Ezenkosi are eighth in the NFD log table with 30 points from 21 games. They trail log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu by 17 points but are just eight behind Black Leopards in second and four behind third placed Stellenbosch FC. The winners of the NFD get automatic promotion to the PSL, while the second and third placed teams join the team finishing 15th in the Absa Premiership in a promotional/relegation play-off mini-league at the end of the season. Sono is targeting second or third place as they bid to return to the top flight. He insists Ke Yona will not distract his team, saying it would rather serve as motivation for his young charges. Sono regards his team as PSL material and is surprised to hear people say they shocked Wits: &ldquo;We are not a lower division team &ndash; that&rsquo;s not how we regard ourselves. Not long ago we were in the PSL playing against Wits. We may be in the NFD but we can match PSL teams. Our target is the semifinals.&rdquo;Sono said he did his research on Wits and knew they would get tired if they got to extra-time. Linda Mntambo gave Cosmos a first half lead but Mogakolodi Ngele equalised midway through the second half. Sono said: &ldquo;We are optimistic that we&rsquo;ll make the play-offs. We have not thrown in the towel yet, we&rsquo;ll fight for that spot.&rdquo;Cosmos will go into their league game against Thanda at Tsakane Stadium on Sunday (3pm) high on confidence.
