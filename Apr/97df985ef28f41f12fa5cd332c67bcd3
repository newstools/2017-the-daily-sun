IN the middle of the silent night when everyone is sleeping, a lime-coloured light appears.That&rsquo;s when Dikeledi Ndlovu knows the time has come for her tokoloshe terror to start!It begins with a scratching noise on her roof that sounds like rats, but it grows louder and louder.Soon the whole house starts shaking, her cupboards rattle and furniture gets tossed around.The 52-year-old from block P in Soshanguve, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the terror started in December and it has torn her family apart. &ldquo;My children are always fighting and they do as they please in my house. There is no more respect,&rdquo; she said.The worried mum said she could only sleep during the day when she was supposed to be earning money. &ldquo;It has become so bad that the whole house starts to shake. I&rsquo;ve been to churches, sangomas and prophets but no one can help me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I sell cosmetics to make a living but this situation has led to me losing customers.&rdquo; Dikeledi said she believed the creature had been sent to torment her by people jealous of her business.She said she always feels tired and suffers from back pain. Sangoma Mantwa Dlamini said Dikeledi needed to perform a traditional ritual. &ldquo;Someone means her harm, but a strong sangoma can help her,&rdquo; she said.
