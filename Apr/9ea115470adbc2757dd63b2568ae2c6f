Bernard Parker's suspension sees him missing Kaizer Chiefs' league encounter with Chippa United at the FNB Stadium on Saturday evening, 6pm kick off.Chiefs head in to the match on the back of a 2-0 midweek win over Bloemfontein Celtic which left them sitting just three points off the top of the table after having won seven and drawn three of their last 10 league matches.The only drawback from their victory was that Parker picked up a booking and now faces a one game ban after accumulating four yellow cards.The Amakhosi striker had been in good form, although he can potentially be replaced by Gustavo Paez, who has been banging in goals after coming off the substitutes bench in recent weeks.Head coach Steve Komphela, however, refused to confirm whether he will start Paez, preferring to keep his opposite number guessing."I don't want to send (Chippa United coach Dan) Malesela any message for now. One has to be mindful of the fact Parker has been doing well for several months now and you mustn't be mislead either by the fact Paez has been scoring.&nbsp;"It's nice to have a goal scorer and now we have to look forward and decide how do we start (on Saturday)," he said.Komphela, meanwhile, was also unwilling to concede that his team have become one of the favourites to win the league, but is happy to be in the hunt."I can say we are still in the race with a couple of matches to play but I must be careful not to make any pronouncements&sbquo;" he said."We still respect the rest of the opponents. Some pronouncements can be seen as a sign of arrogance and we need to be careful about what we say. But we are well within the dogs who are chasing the big bone."Chippa drew 0-0 with Polokwane City in the week. Without a league win in their last eight outings and having slipped to 12th, just three points above the drop zone, Malesela admits he's worried."You cannot not be worried or not be concerned, you have to be, particularly with a team that is not a bad team, but a very good team," he said."You get concerned why the results are not forth coming. But they are challenges that we can overcome."The Chilli Boys' tactician also conceded he has cause for concern up front after his side failed to score against Polokwane; their last five league matches having yielded only two goals."I always pride myself on coming up with solutions, and I think I will. We kept on trying to push people to go forward (against City), but we were not grouping very well."We really let go of the easiest chances to score, but these things happen in football and you can't start pointing fingers at players and say, 'this is what you did, it's your fault'. No. It's nobody's fault."
