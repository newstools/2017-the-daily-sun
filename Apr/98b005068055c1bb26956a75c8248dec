MANY unemployed men stand on the side of the road next to a park at Navalsig, Mangaung, hoping to find work. But on Monday morning they got the shock of their lives when they discovered two pairs of panties next to their spot. They believed it was left there by a sangoma who approached them on Sunday. They said the sangoma told them to pay R50 for good luck or they would not find any work. Others say the sangoma is a con artist who just wanted to scare them. Thabisho Sello (28) said: &ldquo;I have been standing at this spot for two years looking for piece jobs to support my family. &ldquo;On Monday morning, a man approached us and said he was a sangoma. He claimed he could help us find permanent jobs at a cost of R50. We all refused to pay and chased him away. &ldquo;Before the man left he told us we won&rsquo;t get jobs anymore because he had cursed us. &ldquo;We were shocked when we arrived on Monday to find two pairs of panties lying on the side of the road. &ldquo;Since then, not a single motorist has stopped to offer us work. I believe the man cursed this place with the panties he left.&rdquo;John Boroko (48), from phase 6, said he doesn&rsquo;t understand why the sangoma wanted money from them when he could see they were struggling.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in his stupid curse. He is a fake sangoma who just wanted to rob us of our money. I wish he would come back so we could teach him a lesson.&rdquo;Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said: &ldquo;The man who left the panties is not a real sangoma. I advise the men to pour salt on the panties and pray.&rdquo;
