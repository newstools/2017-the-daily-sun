MKHONTO we Sizwe veterans have issued a stern warning.&ldquo;Stay far away from Luthuli House,&rdquo; said Themba Mavundla, KZN chairman of the MK Military Veterans Association.&ldquo;We will send over 600 soldiers to defend our headquarters, our president and the party. We take serious offence when some people want to turn our headquarters into a joke.&rdquo;He did not reveal details but said the KZN soldiers will be at Luthuli House on Friday morning.&ldquo;Our soldiers are combat ready and we will do everything possible to make sure nobody comes near. The ANC has never marched to any party&rsquo;s headquarters,&rdquo; he said.Mavundla was speaking at a media briefing held at the party&rsquo;s KZN office in Stalwart Simelane Street, Durban, yesterday in the wake of calls on President Jacob Zuma to step down.The calls were triggered by the recent Cabinet reshuffle, which saw disagreement among the party&rsquo;s top leaders.Mavundla expressed his disappointment with some of his fellow party members&rsquo; behaviour and public statements.&ldquo;Perhaps these comrades are turning into unpaid supporters of enemy forces. They&rsquo;ve allowed themselves to be pawns in the political battle to reverse the gains of our revolutionary movement.&rdquo;
