EVERY time he has a problem, he goes to his mum&rsquo;s grave to ask for help. He kneels at his mum&rsquo;s tombstone, begging her to provide him with food, shelter and a job.His mother died in 2011.But his sisters are gatvol and have told the man (38) from KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage to get a job instead of returning to their mum&rsquo;s grave at Bucwa Cemetery. His 42-year-old sister said she and her three other sisters were born-again Christians, and they agreed what their brother was doing was a waste of time. &ldquo;My brother must apply for a job at factories, not at the graveyard. &ldquo;What I hate most is that he often mentions our names at the graveyard, and he blames us for being unemployed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has turned our family into a laughing stock. People think we are oppressing him.&rdquo; Another sister (47) said they were sick and tired of feeding their brother. &ldquo;He just needs to find a job.&rdquo;However, the man told Daily Sun he trusted his mum, and knew she would one day answer him. Sangoma Lifa &ldquo;Khandiyeza&rdquo; Noda said: &ldquo;He needs to bring a R2 or R5 coin to a sangoma so he can be cleansed, and his relationship with his mum will be improved.&rdquo; Pastor Thanduxolo Mtakwende said the man was wasting his time. &ldquo;There are just bones in the grave and the dead remain dead. &ldquo;The spirit of the dead goes back to the creator. The dead cannot listen to problems or provide answers.&rdquo;
