FORMER Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza apparently believes only Parliament can remove him from his post. On Sunday, City Press reported that Ntlemeza had no intention of leaving his post and in fact, intended to stay on until 2022, when his term officially ends. He told newspaper he would be reporting for duty today after four days of leave, despite the fact that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula last week appointed one of his deputies, Yolisa Matakata, as acting head. On Wednesday, the North Gauteng High Court ruled that an earlier finding that Ntlemeza was not fit and proper to lead the Hawks should come into immediate effect, despite the fact that he was appealing against the ruling. Mbalula told reporters on Sunday that Ntlemeza was welcome to show up for work but he would not be doing so as Hawks boss. &ldquo;Ntlemeza remains a police officer and has not yet been subjected to disciplinary procedures by the police. Therefore, he remains a member of the SAPS,&rdquo; said the minister. Mbalula said he didn&rsquo;t have time for nonsense. Ntlemeza had been removed from his position by the high court, not by him.However, Ntlemeza insisted he would continue in his job as he was planning to launch an appeal. Responding to a letter in which Ntlemeza argued this point, Mbalula said: &ldquo;We are not in The Bold and the Beautiful. &ldquo;If he understands the law properly, he will understand his place.&rdquo; Police department spokesman Vuyo Mhaga said they would decide how to deal with the situation if Ntlemeza did in fact report for duty.
