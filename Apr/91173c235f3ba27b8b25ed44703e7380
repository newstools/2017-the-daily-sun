TV STAR Tumisho Masha&rsquo;s marriage to his wife Zozibini is said to be over.&nbsp; Trouble started after accusations of physical abuse last year.&nbsp; But Sunday Sun has learnt that after court cases, the once-happy couple never recovered, and have now decided to call it quits.&nbsp; A source close to the situation says that after the alleged abuse stories broke, things took a turn for the worse. Sunday Sun has also heard claims that the couple were living in separate areas.&nbsp; A source claimed that Zozi&rsquo;s mum came to Jozi to fetch her daughter, along with her grandchild. &ldquo;She told Zozi she can&rsquo;t be in that environment with a new baby,&rdquo; claimed the source.&nbsp; But the insider also alleged the couple had been going through a lot, and have tried everything to help fix their marriage.&nbsp; Said the source: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen a marriage counsellor and both families have intervened. Even friends have tried to sit them down and talk.&rdquo; Another source claimed trouble started long before their daughter was born.&nbsp; &ldquo;They love each other, but things got too intense and bad,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; Speaking to Sunday Sun, an emotional Tumisho said he wasn&rsquo;t going to comment about his private life to protect his family.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried about the stories written about me. I&rsquo;m more worried about the people who take them to the press. &nbsp;I wonder what kind of people they are,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; According to another source, apparently Tumisho is still involved in his daughter&rsquo;s life and wants things sorted between himself and his estranged wife. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice guy and wants to co-parent with&nbsp;Zozi,&rdquo; added the source. When the SunTeam called Zozi for comment, she said she was attending her cousin&rsquo;s funeral in the Eastern Cape. When the SunTeam brought up the subject of divorce, she refused to comment.&nbsp;
