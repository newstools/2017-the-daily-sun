IT WAS meant to be a meeting to discuss plans for the land &ndash; but ended up being a huge fist fight. Cops had to be called to calm the situation as residents moered each other with anything they could lay their hands on. A local pastor is accused of having thrown his Bible at a resident. Last week the People&rsquo;s Paper ran a story about people invading the big empty field next to Southridge and Southernwood in Mthatha over Easter.On Sunday the residents met on the site to discuss a way forward. Some villagers wanted a shopping mall, church or taxi rank to be built, while others thought a tavern and magosha hotel would be best. Villager Owen Lingani (42) told the SunTeam residents seemed unable to agree and fists and chairs began to fly.&ldquo;I proposed we open a shisa nyama and tavern. &ldquo;When I said this, a local pastor immediately threw a huge Bible onto my face, knocking me unconscious,&rdquo; said Owen.Zimbane chief Nosizwe Maxhwele said the fight upset her. &ldquo;Those villagers invaded the land without my permission or that of King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality. &ldquo;They disrespected me when I warned them. Seeing them moer each other like wild animals gave me butterflies in my stomach,&rdquo; said Nosizwe. Her latest statement was a different tune from the last time she was seen at the invaded land, when she claimed to have court papers supporting their raid.King Sabata Dalindyebo municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said they are still investigating.&ldquo;In our last council meeting, the Zimbane claim was addressed. The municipality plans to meet properly with residents and reach mutual agreement.&rdquo; Warrant Officer Mankosi Booi of Southernwood satellite police station said no arrests were made and they are investigating the matter.
