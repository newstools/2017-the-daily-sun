MADALA Mandla Mdanda (80) was shot at his home in Mzulwini Village in Maphumulo, northern KZN, on Thursday.He was shot three times in the upper body by two men who stormed into his house. The two thugs fled with R800. Bongi Mdanda (32) told Daily Sun the madala is fighting for his life in hospital. &ldquo;Mandla was with his wife in the house when the incident occurred. It appears that the men gained entry through the back door of the house,&rdquo; said Bongi. She said the madala was preparing the bath when the lights suddenly went off. &ldquo;When he went to see if the main power switch had tripped, he felt a hand touching him. One of the thugs demanded money. &ldquo;They used a phone flashlight and began hitting him and my gogo with the butt of a gun. My grandparents gave them R800, but they proceeded to the next room where the kids were sleeping. My madala tried to fight them off but they shot him three times. They fled on foot. Residents believe thugs use vacant houses as their hideout.Induna Mfaniseni Xulu said abandoned houses in the area are a big concern.&ldquo;These houses are unoccupied, but during the night the lights are turned on. I will urgently call a community meeting so that we can make an agreement so that these houses can be demolished,&rdquo; said Xulu. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said charges of attempted murder and robbery are being investigated by Maphumulo police. &ldquo;No arrests have been made at this stage,&rdquo; said Gwala.
