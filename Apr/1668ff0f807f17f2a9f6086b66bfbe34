HIS only sin was to appear on national TV, 12 days later, he was allegedly poisoned to death.These are claims made by close friends of the late rising kwaito star, Jabu &ldquo;Nkwainda&rdquo; Mavuso from Skhosana Section, in Katlehong, east of Joburg.Nkwainda, who had appeared on e.tv&rsquo;s breakfast show, Sunrise, on 13 March allegedly died of poison on 26 March after attending a stokvel club gathering at Ezenkeni on 25 March.According to his close friends, he was aware that some of his kasi friends were not-so-happy about his promising success in the music industry.&ldquo;He had told us that as much as he was happy that his future looked promising in the music industry, he also knew it would come with challenges that might end up claiming his life,&rdquo; said a&nbsp;friend.The friend added that Nkwainda was sceptical about appearing on Sunrise as he feared his enemies would see that his talent was beginning to reach higher levels.&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t take it seriously, but following the poisoning incident, we now see Nkwainda knew what he was talking about,&rdquo; said the friend.Nkwainda&rsquo;s manager, Cedric &ldquo;Muserr&rdquo; Mabusela confirmed that Nkwainda had told him the same thing, but he encouraged him not to allow enemies to determine his moves on something that he loved with all his heart.&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a coincidence. He told me the same thing, that his instincts were telling him that he was going to be killed if he went on and performed on Sunrise,&rdquo; said Muserr.Muserr said his heart was still bleeding after losing one of the most amazing talents under his wing.&ldquo;Nkwainda was a hard worker and one of the smartest artists I&rsquo;ve ever worked with. It&rsquo;s sad that his passion for kwaito music was cut short,&rdquo; said Muserr.He said Nkwainda vomited non-stop a few hours after sipping a drink at the stokvel.&ldquo;He was rushed to hospital, where he died the following day,&rdquo; said Muserr.&nbsp;Katlehong police confirmed that an inquest docket was opened but were still awaiting the postmortem results.
