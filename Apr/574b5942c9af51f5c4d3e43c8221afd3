BEING blind, in itself, is already a huge challenge. Abram Mooketsi knows all about living without sight since he became blind some 25 years ago.But now his life in the dark has become even worse, because his electricity has been cut off!Abram (50), from Dobsonville, Soweto, said his misery started in November when his account was suspended due to non-payment.&ldquo;I can blame no one but myself,&rdquo; said the former South African National Defence Force employee.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to find and keep a job when you&rsquo;re blind. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a steady job since I left the army in 1992.&ldquo;I need help!&rdquo; said Abram.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see so I use my walking stick to find my way around the house.&ldquo;But living without electricity is hell. I can&rsquo;t run a warm bath or have tea. &ldquo;I cannot even listen to the news,&rdquo; said Abram.He added that his computer, which he uses to communicate through a voice recognition device, was now also useless, without any power.He said he also uses the computer to hear his messages.&ldquo;I cannot charge my phone or use any of the appliances in the house.&rdquo;I need help to overcome my situation. &ldquo;Nothing can bring my sight back, but having electricity would help me.&rdquo; Gauteng Social Development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said Abram&rsquo;s situation was unique and needed attention.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare to find people like Abram living alone.&ldquo;Our officials will visit him to assess his living conditions and try to determine how we can make his situation better.&rdquo;
