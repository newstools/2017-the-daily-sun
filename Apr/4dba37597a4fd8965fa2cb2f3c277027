AMANTSHONTSHO KaMaskandi Awards organisers could be in trouble.Fans turned violent during the ceremony last Saturday.The incident has allegedly forced the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre (ICC) in Durban to launch an investigation.Sources close to the situation say fans pushed and shoved, demanding to enter the venue although they didn&rsquo;t have tickets.&ldquo;Some had tickets and others wanted to pay at the door,&rdquo; claimed one source.Another source alleged that when they were denied entry, they resorted to violence.&ldquo;They even threw cans all over the place and pulled the fencing down. Security guards were given hard time by fans. So, they closed the doors while they were validating the tickets.&ldquo;But fans got more violent and broke the water pipe. Many of them had tickets while others didn&rsquo;t &ndash; but only cash.&ldquo;Some overpowered the guards and managed to enter the venue without tickets,&rdquo; claimed the source.Another source alleged: &ldquo;The ICC is investigating how much damage fans caused. Mlamuli Nxele, the awards founder, is in trouble.&ldquo;These awards can be banned from the ICC, since the centre is classy and violence could ruin its reputation,&rdquo; said the source.A third source said: &ldquo;There were only 3&thinsp;800 tickets sold three days before the ceremony. They should have known better and made more tickets available. Maskandi has a huge following.&rdquo;A fan, who asked to remain anonymous, said when he went to Computicket three days before the event, tickets were already sold out.ICC&rsquo;s marketing manager Scott Langley said: &ldquo;We will liaise with event organisers to advise that sufficient tickets be made available to ensure this kind of occurrence doesn&rsquo;t arise in future.&ldquo;We&rsquo;d welcome the opportunity to host the event again, but that&rsquo;s up to the organisers. We&rsquo;re investigating what avenues are available to recover costs,&rdquo; Scott said.Contacted by the SunTeam, event organiser Mlamuli Nxele refused to comment. But he said he would release a statement.
