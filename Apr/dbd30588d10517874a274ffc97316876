POLICE Minister Fikile Mbalula angered many Zimbabweans when he claimed that former soldiers from that country were responsible for crime in Mzansi.&nbsp; Since his remarks on Tuesday, he has received sharp criticism from the Zimbabwean ambassador and opposition parties.&nbsp; BUT SPEAKING TO DAILY SUN YESTERDAY, MBALULA INSISTED HE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG!&nbsp; The African News Agency reported that Zimbabwean ambassador to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, said his government did not support criminality but Mbalula&rsquo;s remarks were unacceptable.&nbsp; &ldquo;We cannot accept the many ill-informed elements in Mbalula&rsquo;s statement and we deeply regret that they were made without due regard to their accuracy,&rdquo; he was quoted as saying.&nbsp; Zimbabwean Security Minister Kembo Mohadi said Mbalula should have made his complaints through official channels.&nbsp; Mohadi yesterday told Zimbabwean state media that Mbalula&rsquo;s comments were uncalled for.&nbsp; He said the police minister should rather have engaged with his Zimbabwean counterpart,&nbsp; Ignatius Chombo, at an inter-governmental meeting.&nbsp; Speaking to the SunTeam yesterday, Mbalula said he didn&rsquo;t violate any diplomatic rules and his statement was clear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed, some ex-soldiers are crossing the border to do crime in this country.&rdquo;&nbsp; The minister insisted his remarks were not meant to cause anyone harm.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are people who come here from Zimbabwe and they cross the line here.&nbsp; &ldquo;They run away from the military in Zimbabwe and promote criminality here in South Africa,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Speaking to the media on Tuesday, he said Zimbabwean ex-soldiers were robbing banks in Mzansi.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are running away from Uncle Bob. In Zimbabwe, once you are a soldier, it&rsquo;s for life.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get out of it,&rdquo; he told reporters. &ldquo;To get out of it they run to South Africa and come here to rob banks.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, he did make it clear that most Zimbabweans in South Africa were honest and hard- working.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there is anything President Robert Mugabe did well, it was to educate his people.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people working in your kitchens are doctors.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are more educated than you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meanwhile, Gauteng DA leader John Moodey yesterday said his party believed Mbalula&rsquo;s comments were promoting&thinsp; hatred.&nbsp; He said the minister&rsquo;s comments were the result of bad leadership and it looked as if the ANC government had forgotten about its vision for a united Africa.&nbsp; Moodey said Mbalula should stop using hatred of foreigners to explain crime, instead of focusing on securing the borders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mbalula needs to work with the security cluster to boost border security so South Africa can properly regulate immigration.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the DA said it would be complaining to the Human Rights Commission, it is unclear whether the commission had received any complaint.
