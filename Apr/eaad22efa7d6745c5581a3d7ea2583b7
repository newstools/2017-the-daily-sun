GOSPEL artist Dumi Mkokstad is taken, according to the rumour mill &ndash; he&rsquo;s dating Zama Mkhize.They claim he&rsquo;s been hot and happening with Durban Crown Gospel music project manager Zama since 2014.A source close to the situation alleged Dumi&rsquo;s been scoring awards through her influence.The source said: &ldquo;I find it strange that Dumi seems to be winning awards left, right and centre! He and Zama keep their relationship a secret, as they know once it&rsquo;s out, many gospel artists will feel betrayed by Zama.&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll think Zama had an influence in Dumi scoring all those awards. Zama is playing with fire. Because she may be stripped of her position because of the relationship. I wonder &ndash; did she have any influence when Dumi won the awards?&rdquo;The first source added: &ldquo;It feels as if other gospel artists were cheated.&rdquo;A second well-placed source said: &ldquo;Dumi is always working and doesn&rsquo;t have time to entertain girls.&ldquo;Zama is special to have caught his heart and he&rsquo;s prepared to tie the knot and spend the rest of his life with her.&rdquo;A third source said: &ldquo;Dumi is a player of note, because he has been in a relationship with Crown Awards project manager Zama and they have been discreet since 2014.&ldquo;Dumi has kept his love life low-key. By confirming the information you already have, I&rsquo;ll be accused of being bitter. I work for a rival company. But truth needs to be told.&ldquo;Zama can&rsquo;t date a gospel singer and also have an influence on the Crown Gospel Awards through her managerial position.&rdquo;Dumi denied he was dating Zama. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. I work so hard for people to come and discredit me,&rdquo; he said.When asked if he&rsquo;s dating Zama he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a born-again, my sister. I&rsquo;m single and don&rsquo;t even have a girlfriend. This hurts, as people voted for me.&rdquo; One day you will have kids and you will understand how hurting this is.When called for comment, Zama referred inquiries to Crown Gospel Awards publicist, Wendy Sithole, who released a statement for both Zama and Crown Gospel Awards, saying: &ldquo;Zama has never dated Dumi. Even if they were dating, they&rsquo;re adults and that has nothing to do with the organisation &ndash; however, they are not dating and have never dated. &ldquo;Zama is an official, who works as an events manager, co-ordinating logistics like the hall, the sound etc. She&rsquo;s not part of the awards committee nor a judge. She has no say and no involvement in who is shortlisted, nominated or wins.The statement further said: &ldquo;Mzansi can testify that Dumi is a talented young man, who&rsquo;s won on merit.&ldquo;In fact, most of his awards have been voted for by the public. So either you are targeting the CROWNS &ndash; there is no story, or if you are targeting Dumi, still he won on merit.&rdquo;
