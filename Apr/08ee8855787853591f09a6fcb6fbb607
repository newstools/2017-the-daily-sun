ONE minute he was relieving himself in the toilet.The next, Lucas Motshabi was dashing out to rescue his only child from the flames that were eating his shack. Sadly, the 37-year-old father from Zenzele, near Randfontein in Gauteng lost his 17-month-old son Lerato Tlholoe. According to Lucas, Lerato was playing in the shack at the time. &ldquo;My baby boy is gone. I have lost everything and am only left with the clothes on my back. &ldquo;Firefighters tried to stop the blaze but it was too late for my son. We use a paraffin lamp and it was on top of the table, far from him,&rdquo; he said. Community leader Mina Sebitso (26) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;There was huge smoke and Lucas tried his best to save Lerato but that was not to be. &ldquo;On 11 April, a nearby shop caught fire and the owner is still in Leratong Hospital.&rdquo; She claimed they use candles because the Rand West City Municipality has refused to install electricity in the area.Lucas was in no state to speak to Daily Sun. &ldquo;Please not now, let&rsquo;s talk after this,&rdquo; he said, sobbing.Randfontein police spokeswoman Captain Appel Ernst said she was not aware of the incident. &ldquo;We will investigate and update you,&rdquo; she added.Municipal spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe said the electrification process in the area is underway. &ldquo;We are still engaging with all energy formation sectors like the department of energy and Eskom on the process and costs. &ldquo;Formalising informal areas is our priority,&rdquo; said Tlharipe.Arrangements for Lerato&rsquo;s funeral have not yet been finalised.
