POLOKWANE City star Thabiso Semenya has allegedly scored an own goal in bed.This after he allegedly impregnated a young lady who claims they started dating shortly after the death of his wife last year.Semenya, however, denies these allegations.&ldquo;How could I have impreg-nated her while I was mourn-ing my wife&rsquo;s death.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that girl, and don&rsquo;t have a child with her.&rdquo;Otshepang Modisane from Rustenburg, North West, claimed when she told him she was pregnant, Semenya wanted her to abort.He is said to be running away from his daddy duties.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m now left all alone with our kid. When I told him I was expecting, he told me he wasn&rsquo;t ready for another child because he has two kids and was still mourning the death of his wife,&rdquo; she said.She continued: &ldquo;After sometime, he started posting pictures of his kids on his social pages. Then later, told me he was leaving Rustenburg for Polokwane.&ldquo;I thought maybe it was because he didn&rsquo;t like the place, as it reminded him of his late wife, only to find out he was running away from his duties.&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s embarrassed that while he was supposed to be mourning, he was busy gallivanting with me and making a baby in the process.&rdquo;Semenya&rsquo;s wife died in a car accident in March last year.
