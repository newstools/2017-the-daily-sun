TEARS of pain and anger flowed at the emotional send-off of a boy brutally murdered, allegedly by his own uncle. Nosiseko Ngala wept uncontrollably at her four-year-old&rsquo;s son funeral yesterday.Kamvelihle&rsquo;s tiny body was chopped up, his heart eaten and his blood drunk, allegedly by his 30-year-old uncle, on Easter Monday. His remains were buried privately on Wednesday evening at his family home in kwaMangcu Village, near Port St John&rsquo;s. A number of churches, including Methodist and Zionist congregations, packed the family home to bid farewell to Kamvelihle. His brutal murder has left the community scared and angry, with many vowing to avenge his death if the suspect gets bail.Community member Vuyile Mazele said that had the murder happened at Kamvelihle&rsquo;s family home in kuMangcu, they would have killed the suspect with their bare hands.&ldquo;We wanted to rush to his gogo&rsquo;s house in kwaNtsila and sort this animal of a person out but police were already there. They would have found two bodies there if we&rsquo;d got there first. &ldquo;If he gets bail his safety will not be guaranteed here.&rdquo;Port St John&rsquo;s mayor Lindelwa Rolobeni said it was painful that the freedom so hard fought for was breeding criminals.&ldquo;Please do not stop praying. We need divine intervention. We need to work together to fight the drugs and crime here.&rdquo;Kamvelihle&rsquo;s principal, Nolizwi Qhingeni, was in tears, saying her pupils were terrified since the incident.&ldquo;He was a very bright and smart boy. As his name suggests he had a bright future. It is devastating to see his empty chair in class,&rdquo; she said.The suspect, a former convicted murderer, will apply for bail on 2 May at the Port St John&rsquo;s Magistrates Court.
