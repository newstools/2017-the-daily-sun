SOCIAL Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini told the court she knew in October that Sassa couldn&rsquo;t run the social grant programme.However, on Friday Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza told the court a different story when he filed an affidavit accusing Dlamini of misleading the court. According to City Press, Magwaza argued that Dlamini knew of Sassa&rsquo;s shortcomings at least four months before the agency submitted a report to the court in November 2015. He accused her of misleading the court about when she became aware that Sassa would be unable to take over social grant payments. At the time Sassa undertook to take over the distribution of social grants from Cash Paymaster Services on 1 April 2017.Magwaza attached as evidence a letter Dlamini wrote to his predecessor, Virginia Petersen, on 9 July 2015, in which she communicated her decision to appoint a specialised team to ensure Sassa took over the payment of grants.&ldquo;Dlamini appointed individuals to run the project. &ldquo;She retained direct control of the implementation process and Sassa was instructed not to interrupt them or delay them,&rdquo; said Magwaza. He also added that Dlamini was not part of a meeting she claimed, in her court application, to have attended.
