WHILE they hold their breath that they don&rsquo;t lose another family member, they also pray that the court doesn&rsquo;t grant the suspect bail. A gogo (75) from Ulundi in northern KZN is fighting for her life in hospital, and her husband (77) died from head injuries on Thursday.The couple was allegedly attacked by their 23-year-old grandson. He is expected to appear in court today.A family member told Daily Sun the couple was attacked last Monday. &ldquo;The suspect came from a shebeen and demanded that the gogo and madala give him his late father&rsquo;s gun, cow and car.&ldquo;While they were still surprised by his anger, he reached for an iron rod and began beating them,&rdquo; said the relative. &ldquo;All the things he demanded were kept safely since his father&rsquo;s death in 2002. The family needed to call a meeting first to discuss if it was right to pass these things to him as we know he is an alcoholic.&rdquo;He said they haven&rsquo;t told the gogo that her husband died because they fear she might get a shock and die as well. &ldquo;This boy has put us in a very tough position with his brutal action. The funeral will have to wait until the gogo gets better,&rdquo; he said.He said the magistrate should put the suspect behind bars for life for the pain he has caused the family. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;The suspect was arrested and cases of murder and attempted murder were opened at Gluckstadt Police Station for investigation.&rdquo;The man appeared in the Vryheid Magistrates Court last Tuesday and was remanded in custody until today for his bail application.
