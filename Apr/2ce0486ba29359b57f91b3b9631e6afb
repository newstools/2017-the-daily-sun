LEGENDARY trainer and manager Nick Durandt, who passed away in a motorbike accident in Free State on Friday, was South Africa&rsquo;s most successful boxing trainer. He died at age 53.&nbsp;His unexpected passing abruptly ended the life of a colourful character, who set the local boxing scene alight.&nbsp;Durandt had produced an average of one world champion and three national titleholders per year.In the 29 phenomenal years he had been in boxing until his retirement in May, Durandt had produced 38 world champions and 98 South African titleholders &ndash; a feat that sets him apart from his peer. In addition, he had led 27 boxers to international titles.&nbsp;Born a day after Christmas &ndash; 26 December 1963 &ndash; in England, Durandt moved to South Africa at a young age, and was considered a gift to Mzansi boxing.&nbsp;Durandt was a nightclub bouncer before getting involved in boxing at age 23, despite acknowledging that he had never boxed. His choice of boxing was rather odd, as his father was a footballer who was on the books of English side Wolverhampton Wanderers.But instead of getting into his father&rsquo;s soccer boots, Durandt chose boxing &ndash; a sport through which he made an indelible mark and reached unsurmountable heights.&nbsp;The flamboyant Durandt has, in his three decades in the sport, produced some of the finest fighters in South Africa.&nbsp;He turned veteran Thulani &ldquo;Sugaboy&rdquo; Malinga from being an over-the-hill fighter to a WBC middleweight champion in an upset victory over Nigel Benn 20 years ago.&nbsp;He led Cassius &ldquo;The Hitman&rdquo; Baloyi to a record six world titles and the hard-hitting Phillip &ldquo;Time Bomb&rdquo; Ndou to three world belts, including an unsuccessful attempt at the WBC belt against Floyd Mayweather in 2003.His other world champions include Isaac &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; Hlatshwayo, Jeffrey &ldquo;Mongoose&rdquo; Mathebula, Silence &ldquo;African Spice&rdquo; Mabuza, Malcolm &ldquo;The Stone&rdquo; Klassen, Moruti &ldquo;Babyface&rdquo; Mthalane and Simphiwe &ldquo;Golden Master&rdquo; Nongqayi.&nbsp;Although he announced his retirement from boxing in May, when his stable had close to 20 fighters, the sport remained close to Durandt&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;In a media interview a year ago, Durandt &ndash; known for his gift of the gab &ndash; reiterated: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given 29 years to this business and I&rsquo;ll love it until I die.&rdquo;Like the tattoos on his arms, Durandt&rsquo;s name will remain in the annals of Mzansi boxing.&nbsp;
