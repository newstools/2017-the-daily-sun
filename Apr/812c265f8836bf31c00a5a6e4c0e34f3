THE South African Post Office has warned customers not to fall victim to a scam by people pretending to be from their customs division. The scammers tell victims a parcel is ready for collection, provided they pay money into an account. According to the caller, the money is for customs duties and courier fees. Post Office regional spokeswoman Martie Gilchrist said: &ldquo;We are urging the public not to fall for this scam. &ldquo;We would also like to emphasise that we do not ask for any deposits. &ldquo;We only charge a fee in the case of custom parcels, and we let customers know beforehand.&ldquo;In instances where SARS charges import tax on parcels from abroad, the tax must be paid at the Post Office counter when the item is collected. &ldquo;The customer will receive a receipt for this payment.&rdquo; She added that the scammers direct their victims to a website that appears similar to the Speed Services website. The phone number, however, is in the United Kingdom, with a prefix of +44. &ldquo;Customers are also given a pin which they have to enter before they can track the fake parcel. &ldquo;We do not use pin numbers for our tracking service.&rdquo;
