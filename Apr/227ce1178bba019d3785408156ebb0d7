Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata could be ruled out for the rest of the season after undergoing groin surgery, the Premier League club confirmed on Friday.The bad news for United manager Jose Mourinho follows quickly on from the twin disappointments of losing defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones to long-term injuries.The Red Devils confirmed Mata's injury on their website in a short statement on Friday night, saying: "Juan has had surgery for a groin injury. Further updates on his recovery will follow in due course."And the trouble doesn't end there. The Portuguese tactician will also have Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera and Zlatan Ibrahimovic missing for Saturday's Premier League encounter against West Brom at Old Trafford.Herrera and Ibrahimovic are ruled out through suspension, with Pogba suffering from a minor hamstring complaint.Mourinho insists, however, that there is no time for the Mancunians to feel sorry for themselves."We cannot be here crying or speaking about the players who are not available to play," said the 54-year-old. "You know Zlatan and Herrera are suspended, you know that Herrera is two matches banned for that episode against Chelsea."You know what happened in the English national team with Smalling and Jones. You know that we have also Pogba injured, but I repeat they're not important."The important players are the ones that are ready to play and the ones I trust and the ones who are going to give us everything tomorrow to try to keep us in the fight for the top four."
