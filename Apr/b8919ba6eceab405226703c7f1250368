We appeal to the community to help us get rid of this evil.&rdquo;One of the parents, Salamina Mpsye, said the school needs to get a security guard to look after the school at night.Police spokesman Captain Matthews Nkoadi said a case of business burglary and theft was opened and the matter was still under investigation.
