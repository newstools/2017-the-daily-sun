MEMBERS of the Chariots of Fire Church had a miserable Easter weekend. They were left without a place to worship when residents of Naturena, south of Joburg, tore down the church last Saturday. The structure was pulled down and stripped of its windows, doors and zinc sheets. Residents attacked the church after claiming that worshippers made a noise at night and disturbed their sleep. They said they couldn&rsquo;t handle the sound of the keyboard and church speakers any more. Church member Albert Moyo told Daily Sun the church was built in a field in the area as members thought it would help reduce crime. He said many residents were robbed there at night.Albert said the church stopped using a keyboard some time ago as cops visited one night to inform them there had been complaints. &ldquo;We are really hurt and disappointed. &ldquo;A church is supposed to be a respected place but now it has been turned upside down.&rdquo; Resident Cynthia Makwe said she went to the church several times to complain about the noise but members chased her away, telling her they were praising God. &ldquo;My kids couldn&rsquo;t study and I was fed up with all the noise,&rdquo; she said. Another resident said something had to be done as the church was very disruptive. A case of malicious damage to property was opened at Mondeor Police Station.
