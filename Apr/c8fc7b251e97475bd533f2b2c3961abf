EASTER has arrived and people will be travelling back home to spend time with their loved ones.Millions will also be going to the Zion Christian Church headquarters for their pilgrimage.The many road accidents at this time result in death or people being admitted to hospital due to injury.This encouraged the DA in Limpopo to donate blood to the South African National Blood Service in Polokwane from Monday until today.DA youth representative councillor Tiny Chidi was disappointed as she couldn&rsquo;t donate blood due to low blood pressure. &ldquo;I was given a diet to follow so I could donate.&ldquo;We are trying to help the service to get the blood they need as there are many accidents during Easter. &ldquo;We would like to encourage all South Africans to join us to save lives together,&rdquo; she said.Just one donation can save three lives. Chidi urged motorists to drive carefully, buckle up, avoid drinking and driving, as well as overloading and to rest when tired.
