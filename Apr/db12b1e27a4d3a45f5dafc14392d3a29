MAGRET Makhaya has been having sleepless nights since her daughter was brutally killed, allegedly by her ex-boyfriend. The 41-year-old mum from Durban Deep, Joburg, told Daily Sun her daughter, Nonhlanhla (21), was shot almost two weeks ago. She was buried in a field near their house. Marget said Nonhlanhla had fought with the suspect two days before her death. The sad mum told the SunTeam a motorist had driven past the field on the night of the murder and saw a man dragging a woman. &ldquo;The witness said he drove towards the two, but the man walked up to him and pointed a gun. He drove away in fear and then heard two gun shots.&rdquo; The witness waited until the man left and when he went to see if the woman was alright, he found Nonhlanhla&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;My spirit will never find peace until justice prevails,&rdquo; said the mum. Captain Nonhlanhla Khumalo of Roodepoort police said: &ldquo;A murder case was opened and a suspect is on the run.&rdquo;
