THANDAZILE Phoswa, who was found dead on Sunday, was murdered in the same house where her family was massacred.Phoswa&rsquo;s parents and her two brothers died in a political killing in their house in Richmond, KZN in 1997. Cops confirmed that a 36-year-old man has been taken into police custody in connection with Phoswa&rsquo;s death, who was deputy mayor in Richmond.Her family doesn&rsquo;t believe that the murder was a result of a curse or of history repeating itself.Thandazile&rsquo;s uncle, Zachariah Phoswa (50), told Daily Sun they didn&rsquo;t perform rituals because they are Christians.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible that our daughter died where her siblings and parents were killed but we don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s anything to do with the previous deaths. We don&rsquo;t believe in performing traditional rituals. We believe everything happens according to God&rsquo;s plan,&rdquo; said Phoswa.He said they&rsquo;ll pray and plead with God to prevent it from happening again. He added that it won&rsquo;t bring their daughter back but it&rsquo;ll be a comfort to see the perpetrator facing the law.South African Traditional Healers Association president, Sazi Mhlongo, said another Phoswa family member could be killed if they don&rsquo;t perform traditional rituals.&ldquo;This is definitely a curse. They are in denial and must do something about it,&rdquo; said Sazi. KZN police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, confirmed that a man has been detained for questioning but refused to say if it was Thandazile&rsquo;s boyfriend.&ldquo;A 36-year-old man has been detained for further investigation. He hasn&rsquo;t been charged but a case of murder was opened,&rdquo; said Zwane.
