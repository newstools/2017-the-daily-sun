&ldquo;I DID not die. I just went to heaven and returned!&rdquo; This madala claims he was told in heaven it was not his time yet.George Pitso (83), of section D1 in Mamelodi, east of Pretoria said his trip beyond the clouds happened after he fainted in February.&ldquo;Doctors at Mamelodi Hospital told me that I was in a coma for four days. I saw many of my relatives who had died long ago. &ldquo;They were wearing white clothes,&rdquo; George said. He said &ldquo;A sebe ebe nako&rdquo; was written in large letters on a tree trunk. &ldquo;A voice ordered me to return to earth and tell the people to pray to God only. But before I could return, I saw pastors from various churches and a deep hole. They told me they were there to bury me. &ldquo;I was scared and confused and saw a big rock rolling towards us. I ducked and fell. At that moment I fell from the hospital bed. I was shocked to find myself surrounded by a pastor and women from church.&rdquo; He said doctors declared him healthy and he was discharged without any medication. Health spokesman Vuyo Sabani said George spent 17 days at Mamelodi Hospital but did not say what he was suffering from.
