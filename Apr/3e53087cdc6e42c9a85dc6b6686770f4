EMOTIONS ran high as Bidvest Wits edged closer to their maiden Absa Premiership title.CEO Jose Ferreira, coach Gavin Hunt and other members of the club&rsquo;s management, were restless as the belief of lifting the league title is growing with each game. The way that Hunt and Ferreira contested each and every decision that went against them made by the referee, is a clear indication of how bad Wits want to win the title. The Clever Boys have stumbled at the finish line before, but this is clearly a different team on a serious mission. The Clever Boys are peaking at the right time and their 3-0 victory over the hapless Golden Arrows at the Milpark Stadium last night is a step in the right direction. Gabadinho Mhango slotted a first half penalty and a second half brace by Mogakolodi Ngele helped Wits to return to the top of the table with 44 points from 21 games. It&rsquo;s still a long way to go with nine games to go, but with this breathtaking performance the Clever Boys look favourites to win the league title. Wits are two points above second placed Cape Town City FC with a game in hand. They are going into the top of the table clash with City in Cape Town on 19 April high on confidence. There was a moment of silence to mark the 16th anniversary of the Ellis Park disaster where 43 fans lost their lives during the Soweto derby between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates in 2001.
