REAL-LIFE drama seems to be unfolding right before the eyes of former Muvhango actor, Joe Ragwala.&nbsp;This after the star, famous for his role as patriarch Ntshavheni Mukwevho, spent his Easter weekend behind bars.According to Captain Mike Shikwambana of the Retavi Police Station, Joe was nabbed for violating a protection order, obtained against him by his girlfriend&rsquo;s brother Shadrack Mthembi.Said Captain Shikwambana: &ldquo;He was denied bail and the case was postponed to Friday.&rdquo;But on Friday, he was again denied bail after a brief appearance at the Retavi Magistrate&rsquo;s Court. The court postponed his case to 26 April. He is still behind bars.&ldquo;It (the court) warned Joe not to touch the rental fee or kick out any tenent from my parents&rsquo; house, which we have been using as rental property,&rdquo; Shadrack said.&ldquo;But at the end of last month, he instructed all the tenants to pay the rental fee straight to him, and even threatened to kick out those who didn&rsquo;t listen to his instructions. This means he illegally cashed in nearly R5&thinsp;000. He then disappeared when he realised he had contravened the terms of the protection order.&rdquo;Shadrack said Joe was arrested on Good Friday, &ldquo;after police found him in the house with his side chick&rdquo;.&ldquo;He must pay back the money. I don&rsquo;t want him to come back to my parents&rsquo; house. We&rsquo;re tired of him. He smokes dagga all day long and even plays loud music every night. When we complain, he tells us to shut up.&rdquo;Shadrack, who accused Joe of being &ldquo;a selfish person&rdquo;, insisted the actor &ldquo;is not even my sister&rsquo;s husband, he&rsquo;s just a boyfriend, so he must go&rdquo;.An insider claimed Joe was &ldquo;bullying everyone&rdquo; because he was broke and couldn&rsquo;t afford his lavish lifestyle.&ldquo;That guy is a Jonnie Walker. His Colt bakkie was repossessed and sold in an auction, and his Mazda3 was torched at the Mangilasi Village in Limpopo,&rdquo; the source said.According to a second source, Joe moved in with his girlfriend, Doris Mthembi, at her Tzaneen family home in 2010.&ldquo;When he realised the Mthembis were making money from tenants, he started behaving like a bulldog, chasing Doris&rsquo;s family out, so he could cash in on the rental fee.&rdquo;Joe is no stranger to run-ins with the law &ndash; 2009, he was arrested and charged with intimidation.
