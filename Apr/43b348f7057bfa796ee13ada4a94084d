FOR over 20 years, two neighbours from Sisulu in Umzimkhulu, Eastern Cape, have been at each other&rsquo;s throats over a piece of land. Allegations by both camps have turned into physical action.But despite the matter being reported to municipal officials, there is still no solution. Thethiwe Hadebe (62) and Phezile Shezi (53) can&rsquo;t agree on anything.Thethiwe, who built her house in February 1994, claimed Phezile encroached on her yard when building her house in August that year. She tried to talk to Phezile, who allegedly told her to leave her alone.&ldquo;After I spoke to her I reported the matter to the municipality, but nothing was done,&rdquo; said Thethiwe.She said she ignored the issue until March this year when Phezile allegedly added another room to her four-roomed house. &ldquo;She stole a piece of my yard again! I destroyed one side of her house and fenced off my yard with wires. But then her children destroyed my fence. &ldquo;They dug a trench that floods my house with water when it&rsquo;s raining. I reported it to the municipality, but again nothing was done,&rdquo; claimed Thethiwe.Phezile blamed Thethiwe.She said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Thethiwe&rsquo;s problem is. The municipality put me here. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not her yard. I suspect she wants me gone so she can take my yard.&rdquo;She denied invading Thethiwe&rsquo;s yard again by adding a room. &ldquo;I added the room in my yard, but she destroyed it and left a concrete slab. She&rsquo;s the one who dug the trench,&rdquo; claimed Phezile, but she admitted that her children destroyed Thethiwe&rsquo;s fence.&ldquo;The municipality must sort this out to avoid this going too far,&rdquo; said Phezile.Willie Mgcina, Umzimkhulu Municipality spokesman, said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old matter. We thought they had sorted it out among themselves. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll visit them in order to find a solution.&rdquo;
