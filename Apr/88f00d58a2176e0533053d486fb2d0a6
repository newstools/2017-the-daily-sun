The ANC is set to to celebrate President Jacob Zuma's 75th&nbsp;birthday at Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown this afternoon.&nbsp;This as the EFF, DA, Cope, IFP, APC, ACDP, AIC and UDM plan to march to the Union Buildings on Wednesday morning, calling for Zuma to resign.&nbsp;According South African History Online, Zuma was born in 1942 in Nkandla, KwaZulu-Natal.&nbsp;His father was a police officer who died when Zuma was four, and his mother was a domestic worker.&nbsp;Zuma is believed to have taught himself to read by looking at the books of other children who attended school. Zuma and his friends also approached a local woman who had a Grade 6 education to teach them and paid her 25 cents for a lesson. &nbsp;In 1959 he joined the ANC and its youth league.&nbsp;Zuma spent 10 years on Robben Island after he was found guilty of planning to go to Zambia for military training.&nbsp;Zuma shares his birthday with former finance minister Pravin Gorhan, who turns 58.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-to-celebrate-zumas-birthday-in-kliptown-20170412
