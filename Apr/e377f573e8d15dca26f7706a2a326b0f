LIKE her Nehawu colleagues, Dorcus Maponya (31) took part in the Limpopo health sector protest over unpaid bonuses.But even before the protest ended, Dorcus was at home nursing an injured leg and neck. Allegedly, a colleague who wasn&rsquo;t part of the protest knocked her down.Mankweng Hospital clerk Dorcus, from Thabakgone, told Daily Sun it happened on Thursday.&ldquo;I was chanting with the others at the hospital gate and the next thing, I woke up in hospital. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s car hit me at speed from behind,&rdquo; Dorcus said.She claimed the porter from the hospital, who doesn&rsquo;t belong to her union, said the previous day that if anyone tried to stop him from going to work, he would hit them with his car.&ldquo;He did exactly as he said. But I wasn&rsquo;t stopping him. I was facing the opposite direction as he was leaving the hospital premises.&rdquo;Dorcus sustained neck and foot injuries and is recovering at home.She said she wanted steps to be taken against her work colleague.Nehawu Mankweng branch secretary John Modiba said the union suspects Dorcus was targeted by her colleague, as he is from a rival union.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see this as an accident. The man was driving at high speed on the hospital premises, which is not allowed.&ldquo;He provoked us,&rdquo; said Modiba.The protest by health sector workers in Limpopo is ongoing. They demand to be paid performance bonuses owed since 2011, as well as wanting better work conditions.Provincial health spokesman Thabiso Teffo said they were aware of the incident. &ldquo;It took place under abnormal circumstances as our patients were being turned away. We are still investigating.&rdquo;
