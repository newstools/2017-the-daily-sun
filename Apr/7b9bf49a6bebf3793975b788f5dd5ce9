THE triplets&rsquo; mum, Busisiwe Yende, can finally breathe a sigh of relief! Thanks to SunPower, the 30-year-old has received gifts and help from the social development department.On Saturday, a day after the People&rsquo;s Paper published the story about Busisiwe and her three babies, officials visited her at home in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. Busisiwe told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know where to start expressing it.&ldquo;I was stranded and didn&rsquo;t know how I was going to take care of my children.&rdquo;Social workers gave Busisiwe new baby clothes, groceries, milk and other items. The children were taken to a clinic for a check-up and given clinic cards. They start receiving grants from tomorrow and the mum was given a Pick n Pay voucher. Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said: &ldquo;Together with Daily Sun, we could change someone&rsquo;s life for the better. &ldquo;As social development, we care about children and always put their needs first. &ldquo;We believe no child should go hungry and there are mechanisms to ensure every child has food and a roof over their head. &ldquo;If you are a parent or know of a struggling parent, you should approach our offices. We are always there to help.&rdquo; Busisiwe gave birth to triplets in December. Their father disappeared, leaving the unemployed mum alone with the babies.
