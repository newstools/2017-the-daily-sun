A VAAL promoter is allegedly ducking and diving from artists who performed at her event.&nbsp;Sunday Sun understands Jackie Chilli is being sought by several artists who performed at the gig in November.Sources claim Jackie failed to pay some of them.&ldquo;Now she avoids calls from the artists she booked for last year&rsquo;s Vaal River Carnival Festival,&rdquo; said the source.The source claimed the event was sponsored by the municipality, so some artists were paid in full.&ldquo;But others got half the money. That&rsquo;s funny, as the artists who weren&rsquo;t fully paid didn&rsquo;t even charge her the normal amount. I know for sure that she didn&rsquo;t payDonald Moatshe, Jaziel Brothers and Ringo Madlingozi. Money was there for the artists, the gig was sponsored. It came as a shock that some artists weren&rsquo;t fully paid,&rdquo; said the source.The source added that some artist managers were sceptical about doing business with Jackie.&ldquo;This was the first time she did business with some of the artists&rsquo; managers. Usually, they want full payment up front. Jackie negotiated with them &ndash; and they trusted her as she seemed decent.&ldquo;But she only paid some of them 50% of what she was supposed to pay, and that was discounted,&rdquo; claimed the source.According to another source, Jackie avoided artists&rsquo; calls and they stopped trying to get their money back.Said the source: &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t want to blow things out of proportion and jeopardise their relations with other promoters.&rdquo;When Donald&rsquo;s manager Percy Vilakazi was called for comment, he said: &ldquo;Sometimes things go wrong. All we ask is for communication lines to remain open, and that we be respected and kept in the loop. A service has been rendered, so people need to get what&rsquo;s due to them.&rdquo;Ringo refused to comment. His manager, Daniel, said: &ldquo;Did you call Jackie? Please, call Jackie. I don&rsquo;t want to say anything.&rdquo;Jaziel Brothers referred Sunday Sun to their manager, Ntuthuko Mdluli, who said: &ldquo;A delay in payment happens. We understand these things do happen, but a five-month delay is far too long and unacceptable. We gave Jackie discounted fees for her show. She&rsquo;s been dishonest as to why she hasn&rsquo;t paid us.The Jaziel Brothers performed. Now,&rdquo;When called for comment, Jackie asked the SunTeam to send her an email, saying she intended sending it to stakeholders, as they hadn&rsquo;t paid her. But she has failed to respond to our emails and follow-up calls and SMSes since last week.
