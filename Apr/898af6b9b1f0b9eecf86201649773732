MAMELODI Sundowns must bring their A-game when they host Bloemfontein Celtic in a catch-up Absa Premiership clash at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tonight (7.30pm).The defending Premiership champions have taken only two points from their last four league matches but star Anthony Laffor says they will bounce back against Celtic.The Liberian international striker said Celtic always give them a hard time, as was again the case in the first round match away, which was tight. Downs won 1-0.&ldquo;I expect it will be close again,&rdquo; he said.Sundowns are still smarting from the 2-1 loss to fellow title-chasers Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium at the weekend, but Laffor said: &ldquo;We must forget about Chiefs, focus on Celtic and start winning league matches again.&rdquo;Laffor expects relegation-threatened Phunya Sele Sele to come out firing against the champions: &ldquo;Celtic just beat Polokwane City 1-0 at the weekend, so their spirits will be high. They will also be out to impress their new coach (Luc Eymael). So we have to be on our A-game.&rdquo;Celtic&rsquo;s win over Eymael&rsquo;s former club City in Polokwane was a controversial affair, with Rise and Shine refusing to allow their former coach access to the Celtic dressing-room. The Belgian born coach dumped City last month. City have taken Eymael to the PSL disciplinary committee claiming breach of contract.The win lifted Celtic to 12th place with 22 points but the Free State outfit are only four points ahead of bottom club Baroka FC.Said Laffor: &ldquo;We are not worried about Celtic&rsquo;s fight for survival. &ldquo;All we are worried about is winning and retaining the league title.&rdquo;He disclosed that head coach Pitso Mosimane had worked hard with his strikers this week. Said Laffor: &lsquo;We have been doing a lot of work on finishing. We know that we have not done well in recent games and have not won for a while. We need to break the ice and get back on the winning trail against Celtic.&rdquo;
