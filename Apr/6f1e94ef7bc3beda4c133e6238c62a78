THE bus trip home from the grant paypoint almost ended in death for villagers.The bus they were travelling in on Monday rolled backwards and fell on its side. The packed vehicle belonging to AB350 Buses was travelling from Lady Frere in Eastern Cape when it lost power going up a steep hill near Machubeni Village. A bus belonging to the same company was involved in a deadly accident in August 2015 in Willowvale after it veered off the road, killing 35 people. No one died in Monday&rsquo;s accident, but many were hurt and some were taken to Glen Grey Hospital. A passenger said she thought she was dying in the overcrowded bus. &ldquo;It had been an uncomfortable ride from town,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When the bus started rolling backwards, I held on for dear life. &ldquo;We all started screaming. The conductor managed to help the driver keep the bus from going off the road. &ldquo;The bus was old and the steering-wheel was tied with a rope.&rdquo; Sizwe Kupelo, Eastern Cape&rsquo;s health spokesman, said 60 people were on the bus, and none of them was critically injured. Wonga Thutha, AB350 Buses CEO, said the bus would be assessed to find out what went wrong. &ldquo;The driver was hospitalised. We will get his statement once he has recovered.&rdquo;
