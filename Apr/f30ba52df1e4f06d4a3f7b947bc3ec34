THERE&rsquo;S plenty of talent in the local pornography industry, says Zwoluga Madega of Hazams TV Movie.&nbsp;But budget is a bit of an issue at times, according to the local porn director from Thohoyandou in Limpopo.The film-maker insisted there was an abundance of actors and actresses eager to feature in his porn movies, so much that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to chase away white chicks and those who wouldn&rsquo;t disclose their age&rdquo;.&ldquo;Budget is an issue because buyers want local flavour. They&rsquo;re tired of seeing only white people in this industry. Pornography is not meant for white people only, it&rsquo;s for all adults,&rdquo; Zwoluga said.&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t appreciate the scale of this industry. In 2014, I was verbally attacked when I wanted to release Bush Pie in Thohoyandou&rsquo;s town hall. The municipality denied us access to the hall.&rdquo;And Zwoluga emphasised he knew the ins and outs of &ldquo;this fascinating industry&rdquo;.Said Zwoluga: &ldquo;I know my job, Bush Pie#3, Banana#2, No Sex Before Lobola 3, Big Sucks Longrun 7 and New Taste are in the market. If you Google sex4me, you&rsquo;ll see all these productions. They were produced in Venda. The movie Bush Pie is even registered with the Film and Publication Board.&ldquo;Despite the struggles I face as a film-maker, I&rsquo;m determined to see local porn succeed. In fact, the bad noise made by people when I wanted to launch Bush Pie in Thohoyandou hasn&rsquo;t deterred me. It&rsquo;s been a blessing in disguise.&rdquo;The film-maker insisted producing pornographic movies didn&rsquo;t make him a bad person.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the entertainment business, and my movies include romantic, horror and pornographic storylines,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Currently, I&rsquo;m shooting comedy and drama. Once my budget returns to normal, I&rsquo;ll continue with pornography.&rdquo;Zwoluga, whose mainstream movies have featured big-name stars the likes of Suzan Ravuku who plays Fheli in SABC2&rsquo;s Muvhango, says he gives aspiring young actors an opportunity to follow their dreams.
