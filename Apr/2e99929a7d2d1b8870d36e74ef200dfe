DRAMA unfolded in the Absa Premiership clash between Polokwane City and Bloemfontein Celtic at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium yesterday. Celtic players went on a rampage at half-time after an altercation in the tunnel with security officials when coach Luc Eymael tried to enter it to speak to his players. Security denied him access, as he is not permitted to enter the change-rooms.Eymael made headlines after announcing his shock departure from the Limpopo based club to take up the reins at Celtic. The two parties are in a fight after City acted quickly to block his move to the Free State club.The PSL has postponed the case between Eymael and City to next week.The half-time squabble didn&rsquo;t deter the Free State side, as they got a much-needed win, beating Rise and Shine 1-0 thanks to a brilliant goal by midfielder Lyle Lakay. Lakay scored the only goal of the game in the 74th minute from long range. Celtic came into this match in deep trouble and facing relegation, but the win will help ease their worry somewhat. They are now 12th in the standings with 22 points from 21 games, while City remain seventh with 27 points from 22 games.Celtic dedicated their win to the late Dr Petrus Molemela, who died last week. Molemela was the founder and life president of the Free State club and will be laid to rest tomorrow.Funeral proceedings start at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium at 7am before moving to Phahameng cemetery where Molemela will be buried. The home side could have taken the lead in the first 20 minutes when Thapelo Tshilo&rsquo;s header hit the crossbar in the 13th minute . They got another chance to break the deadlock in the 20th minute but Rodney Ramagalela, returning from injury, was also denied by a goalpost. They could have grabbed a late equaliser but the attempt again hit the crossbar.
