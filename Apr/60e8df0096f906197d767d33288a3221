Bayern Munich manager Carlo Ancelotti has called for video technology to be introduced in the game after his side were controversially knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid on Tuesday.Already 2-1 down from the first leg in the quarter-final encounter, the German champions took the tie into extra-time but eventually fell to a 6-3 defeat after a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick for the hosts.However, Bayern were hard done by as Arturo Vidal received a harsh second yellow card while Ronaldo was clearly in an offside position when he scored his second goal.Ancelotti told Mediaset Premium after the game: "We had thought of everything going into this game - except the referee. It's a pity, because it was the perfect game otherwise."I am very proud of my players, as they did all they could and more, but then it went the way it went... The referee probably wasn't up to the task."I don't think Real Madrid have any influence on referees. The officials tonight simply got it wrong. I had never been in favour of VAR technology, but I must admit it's necessary now."You can't decide a Champions League semi-final spot like this. I spoke to (Zinedine) Zidane after the game and he agreed with me that the refereeing performance was negative."It shouldn't be happening at this level and I hope the referees will be helped by technology as soon as possible."
