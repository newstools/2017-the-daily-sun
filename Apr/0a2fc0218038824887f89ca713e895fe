THE parents of a drug addict from Matabetulu are lucky to be alive. The 38-year-old man allegedly stabbed his parents with a knife after a disagreement at their home on Wednesday. A relative (61) of the suspect said he hoped the cops would keep him in jail for a long time. &ldquo;He nearly killed his parents. He stabbed his mum (52) in the neck and when his dad tried to take the knife from him he stabbed him in the face twice,&rdquo; said the relative. &ldquo;His father eventually took the knife away. Only God knows what would have happened if his dad was not at home.&rdquo; Another relative said the suspect is a drug addict who often gets angry over minor things. &ldquo;Last year he stabbed his younger brother after he asked him why he was beating their niece. We didn&rsquo;t report him because we hoped he would change his behaviour.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of assault was opened at Inanda Police Station. &ldquo;A 38-year-old suspect was arrested and charged.&rdquo; The suspect appeared in the Ntuzuma Magistrates Court yesterday.
