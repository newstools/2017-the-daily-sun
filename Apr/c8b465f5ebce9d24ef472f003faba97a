CHELSEA are still in a &ldquo;really good position&rdquo; to win the Premier League title despite Saturday&rsquo;s shock 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, manager Antonio Conte said yesterday.Chelsea saw their lead over second-placed Tottenham Hotspur cut to seven points after the loss, and Conte warned his players that they faced another tough test against fourth-placed Manchester City tonight.&ldquo;I think we didn&rsquo;t deserve to lose the game to Crystal Palace but football is wonderful, also for this type of result,&rdquo; the Italian told a news conference.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s normal that with 27 points available anything can happen in the league, but we are in a really good position.&ldquo;We must play with great attention when we go forward because of Manchester City&rsquo;s counter-attacking threat. We haven&rsquo;t had many days to prepare for this game but it&rsquo;s the same for Manchester City,&rdquo; he said. &ndash; REUTERS
