EFF chief whip Floyd Shivambu is in trouble. The MP has to face the music over unparliamentary comments he refused to withdraw.Shivambu refused to withdraw a comment he made about President Jacob Zuma during a debate on a motion of no confidence against the president.&ldquo;Before you know it, he (Zuma) would have captured everything. After he has dealt with everyone else, he is going to arrest you. He is going to arrest all of you. &ldquo;He is going to lock you up. He is going to kill you. He has nothing to lose now,&rdquo; Shivambu told MPs in November.&rdquo;When advised by parliament&rsquo;s chair to withdraw the comments, Shivambu flatly refused. Parliament announced yesterday that Shivambu was officially being referred to its disciplinary committee, in terms of rule 219, for refusing to withdraw the comment.
