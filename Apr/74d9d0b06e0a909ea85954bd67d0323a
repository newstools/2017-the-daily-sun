THREE top officials from Nongoma Municipality in northern KZN, all heads of municipal departments, are serious trouble.The three are being investigated for irregularities relating to the use of municipal funds and for failing in some of their duties. &ldquo;The matter is under wraps for now,&rdquo; said a source.Daily Sun has learned that the three officials, who were served with an intention to suspend last Friday, have less than a week to respond to the council and state reasons why they should not be suspended.It was also alleged that the three have since been absent from work, and at a meeting on Wednesday the council recommended that people be appointed to act in their positions.The People&rsquo;s Paper is in possession of a letter listing the three officials&rsquo; names.Municipal manager Bonga Ntanzi confirmed that three officials were served with an intention to suspend, but declined to give further details.&ldquo;They have not responded yet,&rdquo; he said.Ntanzi denied the officials had been absent from work illegally and that new people were recommended to act in their positions.&ldquo;They are still with us; only one of the three is on sick leave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Wednesday&rsquo;s council sitting was about our budget and it had nothing to do with them.&rdquo;
