NOT all pupils look forward to going to school every day!A worried 31-year-old woman from Chatsworth, Durban who is parenting her younger sisters, told Daily Sun they have asked her to find them another school.They say they have had enough of the grade 11 geography teacher at their school who insults black pupils in class.&ldquo;They have been reporting this to me since the beginning of the year. &ldquo;I ignored it but when they recently told me to find them another school I realised it was serious and they were fed up.&rdquo; The guardian said the teacher allegedly calls black pupils baboons who don&rsquo;t deserve to be educated.She said she wants the education department to intervene so justice can be served.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to another school. Instead I want the department to investigate. The necessary action should be taken because we can&rsquo;t have teachers with such behaviour. It will negatively affect education.&rdquo; She added that she phoned the school to lodge a complaint and the person who answered the phone said the school would investigate and come back to her, but no one has done so.KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the department will investigate. &ldquo;The Constitution strongly condemns discrimination in South Africa. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tolerate such behaviour at our schools. &ldquo;We will investigate and take the necessary disciplinary action.&rdquo; SGB chairman Essa Ramjan said he&rsquo;d never heard of such a matter.&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t expect that from our teachers. &ldquo;But I would like to meet the guardian so I can take down all the needed information that will help me to address these allegations,&rdquo; Ramjan said.
