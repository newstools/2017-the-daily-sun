WHEN Madithole Tsime was invited to go to church with her friends to be cleansed last Wednesday, she jumped at the chance. But that was the last time her family saw her alive. Her mutilated body was found in a river the next day! The 39-year-old from Munsieville in Krugersdorp was taken to the river for the cleansing but no one is sure what happened after that. The next day, her mutilated body was found in the water with her brain missing. Residents believe she was taken by a water snake which ate her brain, but her husband, Clement Nkasana, is not convinced. He told Daily Sun he wanted answers as to what happened to her. If I d known my wife would lose her life by going to that church with her friends I wouldn t have allowed her to leave. I lost my wife and my children have lost their mother. Madithole helped me a lot and there s a big void now that she s gone. We got different stories about what happened and no one is telling us how she got to the river. Her son Thabiso said Madithole provided for the family. I m so devastated. It will take us a long time to get over this. I wish we had answers about what happened. I have four siblings who are still very young and they don t understand what happened to our mum. Thabiso said his mum had gone away with her friends because she loved going to church. An inquest docket has been opened at Krugersdorp Police Station.
