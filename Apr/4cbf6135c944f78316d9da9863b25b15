COPS in Limpopo say they have increased manpower in Vuwani and surrounding areas after another eruption of violence.At least four cars were damaged in a protest against the Municipal Demarcation Board's decision to incorporate the area into LIM 345, a new municipality.Schooling suffered today as children and teachers, fearing for their safety, opted not to go to classrooms.Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba urged residents in the area to put their children first by allowing and encouraging them to go to school.Police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said more officers had been deployed to try and protect residents and property."No stone will be left unturned in the case of any criminality in that area because the police have made adequate deployments," said Ngoepe.Motorists were advised to drive with caution, especially during the night because there had been reports of stones being thrown from bushes. Ngoepe said four cars had been damaged by people throwing stones from a bushy area near Masakona village, and that cases of malicious damage to property had been opened.Arrests are yet to be made. Ngoepe said the police would continue to monitor the situation.Last year, about 26 schools were torched and vandalised when residents protested against the Municipal Demarcation Board.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/more-police-in-vuwani-as-violence-erupts-again-20170418
