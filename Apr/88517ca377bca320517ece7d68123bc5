KATLEGO SEBOLA never dreamt of being a model until she was persuaded by her roommate.She started building her portfolio and attending fashion shows.The 20-year-old from Musina, Limpopo, was excited when she was informed she was the SunBabe of the Month.&ldquo;I was so excited by this phone call. It actually made my day because it means I&rsquo;m a step closer to living my dream,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d become a model. My mum encouraged me to join beauty pageants while I was in primary school.&ldquo;I enjoyed them, but they were discontinued at school. I wasn&rsquo;t hurt because I wanted to be an actress, but coming from a small town where you have to move to Joburg to become a successful actress, I opted to become a businesswoman,&rdquo; she said.Katlego said she moved to Jozi to study marketing management at Boston City Campus and Business College, and is doing her third year.&ldquo;This opportunity came at the right time because after finishing my study, I&rsquo;m planning on taking modelling on a full-time basis. And this opportunity will open doors for me,&rdquo; she said.
