THE remains of freedom fighter Nkululeko Jako arrived home on Wednesday. Family and friends came to the East London Airport to welcome the body of the dead hero who left for exile in 1963. The Azanian People&rsquo;s Liberation Army soldier went to England, where he died and was buried 20 years later. On 8 April, arts and culture MEC Pemmy Majodina led a delegation to England to repatriate the remains. The department and the Eastern Cape repatriations and reburial committee has a programme to assist conflict victims&rsquo; families to recover the remains of their loved ones. Then they are reburied with dignity. Majodina told Daily Sun it wasn&rsquo;t an easy task. &ldquo;We were asked many questions in England because he was a citizen of that country, but finally we came home with the remains. &ldquo;Comrades, family members and PAC members, here are his remains. Please welcome him,&rdquo; she said.Nkululeko&rsquo;s wife Shumikazi Jako wept tears of joy when she saw her husband&rsquo;s remains. &ldquo;It was painful to spend many years while my husband was buried in another country.&rdquo;He will be buried in East London on Saturday.
