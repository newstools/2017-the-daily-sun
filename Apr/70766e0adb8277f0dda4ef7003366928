MARITZBURG United chairman Farook Kadodia says negotiations with Mamelodi Sundowns are well on course for the sale of his promising player Deolin Mekoa.Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane apparently views Mekoa as a possible replacement for Keagan Dolly who has since moved overseas. Kadodia said the African and South African champions are serious about the left winger, who can also play as left full back, and want him to join them in July at the end of the current PSL season. Said Kadodia: &ldquo;Yes, we are keen to sell Deolin. The deal is that we also want one of their players to be part of Deolin&rsquo;s sale in return. That&rsquo;s the stage of our negotiations.&rdquo;It has been widely reported that Kadodia has already received a R5 million fee from Downs for the sale of the 23-year-old old defender who was born in the UK, but the Maritzburg boss denied it. He said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where people get such stories. There is no such thing, I haven&rsquo;t received any payment from Sundowns because we are still negotiating. Such reports could jeopardise our negotiations.&rdquo;Tonight Mekoa and his two teammates Evans Rusike and Brian Onyango will be out serving suspensions when the Team of Choice take on Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth (7.30pm). Kadodia said just because his team hadn&rsquo;t played competitively in the last 10 days didn&rsquo;t mean they had added advantage over Chippa.Chippa were part of the Nedbank Cup semifinal draw last night following their 1-0 quarterfinal win at home against Jomo Cosmos on Saturday Added Kadodia: &ldquo;The long layoff doesn&rsquo;t guarantee you a better chance of winning your next game. In fact, Chippa have a better chance of having a good game than us because they still have the rhythm from playing on Saturday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be an interesting match though.We must win to stay in the top eight.&rdquo;
