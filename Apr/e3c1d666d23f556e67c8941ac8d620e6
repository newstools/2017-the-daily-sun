DESPITE the fact that Numsa initially criticised other unions for signing a 9% wage deal with bus companies, it signed on Saturday. The bus strike has now come to an end and although it caused inconvenience to many people, most commuters were just relieved to have transport again. Linda Makhanya (28), from Chiawelo in Soweto, told Daily Sun he used the Rea Vaya buses to get to work every day. &ldquo;I struggled a lot last week when the buses were on strike. I had to spend more money than I had budgeted for to use taxis. I&rsquo;m happy the buses are back now.&rdquo; Mama Nozizwe Mkhonza (49), from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni said she was disappointed because she had to cancel a trip to KZN last week. The national bus strike started last Wednesday. But by Saturday some companies had started operating again after reaching an agreement with unions on Friday. Irvin Jim, Numsa&rsquo;s general secretary, described the deal as a sell-out because workers had settled for a 9% increase after demanding 15%. Jim said they were forced to sign to ensure peace and stability in the sector. He said the workers had been let down by other unions, which had failed to address issues such as poor working conditions. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi welcomed the end of the strike and thanked all involved for coming to an agreement.
