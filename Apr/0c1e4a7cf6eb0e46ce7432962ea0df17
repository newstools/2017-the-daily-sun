WHILE most South Africans can access social media on their phones and keep up to date, some villagers have been left behind . Mpandoni, Duvhuledza, Mubvumoni and Tshimbolimbo villages in the Vhembe district of Limpopo have not had network coverage since cellphone technology was introduced to Mzansi. Community spokesman Mashudu Ralukukwe said more than 30 000 people were affected. &ldquo;The lack of network coverage is seriously affecting our everyday lives, business opportunities and job opportunities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have engaged a number of stakeholders in the hope that we will get a positive response.&ldquo;When Vodacom promised to build a cellphone tower in the area we were overjoyed, but we are still waiting.&rdquo; Mashudu said he had helped the cellphone giant acquire land for the tower, but the process was taking too long. &ldquo;I have contacted the company several times in vain. The responses I receive include excuses that they are waiting for aviation and environmental assessors to approve the building of the tower,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are calling on all involved who can assist us, to rescue us from this technological desert.&ldquo;This issue has increased crime in our area. There are deaths that could have been prevented if we had been able to contact emergency services.&rdquo; Spokesman for Vodacom Byron Kennedy confirmed that a team from the company&rsquo;s regional operations in Limpopo met the tribal authority office of Mpandoni villages in November last year and made the commitment to build a base station site. &ldquo;Usually it takes a year for all the activities to be carried out. However, we have now made the project high priority. We have committed ourselves to build the site by December this year,&rdquo; said Kennedy.He added that during the 2016-2017 financial year, the company had invested R165 million in the Limpopo region to expand coverage and increase network capacity and speed.
