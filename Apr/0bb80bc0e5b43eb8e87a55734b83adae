BIDVEST Wits coach Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s decision to field a second string team against Egyptian side Smouha SC in the Caf Confederation Cup looks to have backfired.Wits played to a goalless draw against the Egyptians in the first leg of the play-off round at Bidvest Stadium on Saturday. Hunt made six changes to the team that lost on penalties to Jomo Cosmos in the Nedbank Cup earlier last week, giving youngsters such as Vincent Pule, Ben Motswari and Reeve Frosler a run.The Students now have a mountain to climb when they go to Egypt for the second leg this weekend. They will need to win or come home with a score draw in order to qualify for the group stages.Meanwhile, Smouha coach Moamen Soliman, who coached Egyptian giants Zamalek for the 2016 Caf Champions League final, said they would not make things easy for the Students in Egypt.&ldquo;We did not concede and that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything &ndash; Al Ahly played against Wits in Egypt and Wits were better. I know they are a good team. We have no experience in African competitions but we will give our best.&rdquo;Wits defender Frosler, who is slowly making his mark in Wits&rsquo; first team after being promoted from the MultiChoice Diski Challenge side, has embraced the challenge of playing with the big boys.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting game-time and I&rsquo;m happy with that. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice to come from development and break into the first team, where there&rsquo;s tough competition. &ldquo;Competition is healthy and having to compete with former Bafana Bafana defender Siboniso Gaxa is always motivating. I&rsquo;m learning a lot from him.&rdquo;
