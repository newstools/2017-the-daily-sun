THE fight against drug use cannot be fought by cops alone &ndash; residents, business people and churches must also play a crucial role in fighting the scourge they represent.This was said by Ricardo Mthembu, the KwaDukuza mayor, during a drugs and substance abuse indaba held in the area on Wednesday. The aim of the indaba was to raise awareness of the outbreak of substance abuse in the community. Mthembu made a commitment to champion the fight against illicit drugs and substance abuse. &ldquo;In May, we will convene a round-table discussion to zoom in on drug issues and make key policy proposals as a way to intensify the fight against drugs.&rdquo; He said it was critical for local government to come up with solutions leading to the formation of a programme based on discussions with the community. &ldquo;I am willing to work with anyone to eradicate the scourge of illegal drug dealing.&rdquo; He said they are aware that cops work tirelessly to deal with illegal drugs, however that was not enough as the number of new addicts in their community continues to increase.&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s engagement, we have agreed that the council should investigate the establishment of a rehabilitation centre, working with key stakeholders.&rdquo; This should be finalised by June. &ldquo;It is clear that there&rsquo;s a need for an aggressive approach that will not only involve law enforcement but the knowledge and resources of business people, religious denominations, medical practitioners and residents.&rdquo; Resident Nomusa Ngcobo (35) said drugs affect a lot of families.&ldquo;We would be happy if a lot more could be done to fight against drugs and the suffering they cause.&rdquo;
