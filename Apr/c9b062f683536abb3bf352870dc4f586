THERE&rsquo;S a saying that an eye for an eye makes the world go blind, but this is not something the residents of Marikana squatter camp believe. They say anyone who kills in the area must know that punishment will follow swiftly.The residents of the squatter camp in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni have been burning down shacks belonging to thugs to send the message that criminals are not welcome in their kasi. A resident told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Anyone who kills will suffer the consequences!&rdquo;On Saturday, a man was told to leave the squatter camp and his shack was burned down by angry residents who accused him of killing his neighbour, George Mkhavhele (53). The suspect allegedly attacked George after he refused to buy the man a beer. Lucky Makamu, George&rsquo;s relative, said his family was devastated by the murder. Community leader Hector Legodi said in most cases the killers fled from an area after committing a crime and were never seen again. &ldquo;Residents destroy the belongings they leave behind to make sure they never return. We are not going to allow criminals to live here,&rdquo; he said. One resident said: &ldquo;We are tired of people who enjoy spilling blood. Last year, several shacks were burned after their owners committed murders. We want people who live here to behave. We don&rsquo;t want killers here.&rdquo; The man accused of killing George is on the run. A case was opened at KwaThema Police Station.
