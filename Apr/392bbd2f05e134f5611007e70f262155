My garage door and gate were wide open and my car was crashed into a tree opposite my house. The front doors were open and the rear window was shattered. But the people who pushed it out of my yard were nowhere to be found.&rdquo; Madala Michael, who lives alone, suspected the thugs followed him when he returned home that evening.&ldquo;If it was not for that tree, my car could have crashed into my neighbour&rsquo;s house. I thank God for saving it, and will continue to praise Him, who I know I can count on in any situation.&rdquo;He said the Mabopane police who arrived at the scene refused to open a case.&ldquo;They said maybe the handbrake was not pulled up, causing the car to roll out.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Captain Rheineth Motlana said the complainant should come to the police station to give his side of the story.&ldquo;We may open an attempted motor vehicle theft case for him,&rdquo; she said.
