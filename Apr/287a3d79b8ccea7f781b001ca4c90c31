MEMBERS of the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association (MKMVA) gathered outside the ANC's Luthuli House headquarters in Joburg this morning, as the DA begins its march.Dressed in camouflage, the MKMVA members stomped their feet as they sang.Thousands of ANC supporters marched to the nearby Beyers Naude Square, holding the party flag, while others carried sticks, golf clubs and sjamboks.A source with knowledge of security operations told News24 that people stationed on the Luthuli House rooftop were police snipers.MKMVA national executive committee member Mabel Rweqane said the association had mobilised to defend the party's headquarters."We are here to defend our HQ - the HQ of the ANC - from any harm that may arise from the march that is coming led by the DA. Most of the marches have been organised in the name of [peace, but] at the end of the day they end up violent," she told News24."Stoning people, stoning cars, stoning buildings, looting and all that ... We don't want that to happen on these premises."When asked by News24 about claims that the ANC was instigating violence with the show of force outside Luthuli House, she asked: "Why must we not be here? We are here as MK, we are here to defend the ANC."Provincial leaders from Mpumalanga, Free State and KZN were also spotted in the crowd."We are here to defend our revolution," Mpumalanga deputy chairperson Violet Siwela told News24.ANC head of communications Khusela Sangoni said the national office had nothing to do with the demonstrations.Thousands of DA supporters gathered at the Westgate transport hub, clad in their blue T-shirts.They held placards that read "Fire Zuma", while one banner read "Zuma must fall. A nation divided will never stand together".DA spokesperson Phumzile van Damme said the party's "simple" message was that it wanted an ethical leader for SA.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sticks-sjamboks-and-golf-clubs-outside-luthuli-house-20170407
