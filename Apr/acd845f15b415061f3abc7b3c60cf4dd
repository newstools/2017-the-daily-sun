A GROUP of people from the workshop at a blind centre in Ga-Rankuwa, north of Tshwane are protesting.They have blocked the centre&rsquo;s gates, locking in management because they are unhappy with the way they are treated. They claim the workshop where they manufacture their goods has been locked and they were not involved them in the decision.The group spent Friday night outside the centre. Nkau Mashabela (49) said since social development handed the centre to a private company, things haven&rsquo;t been the same.The workshop has been closed since January, after the blind people complained of mismanagement of funds.Nkau said they would keep the gate locked until the department met with them. &ldquo;No attention has been given to our complaints for the past four months.&rdquo; He said they had asked the department to step in. &ldquo;We received letters in January saying the workshop would be closed, but nothing has been done about our concerns.&rdquo; He said they have been struggling since the workshop closure, as what they make supports their families and they won&rsquo;t rest until the centre&rsquo;s management is fired. He said if the department can&rsquo;t control the situation, it will be better to lock the workshop and hand the keys to police until their problems are solved.They also demanded immediate intervention from Minister Bathabile Dlamini.
