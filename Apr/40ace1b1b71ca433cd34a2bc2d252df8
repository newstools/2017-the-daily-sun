THE Social Justice Coalition has met various Western Cape communities to map a way forward in the fight against the planned R100 million Muizenberg cop shop upgrade. People said they are prepared to go to battle to ensure police resources are shared equally. Members of the neighbourhood watch and street committees told Daily Sun their homes have been turned into police stations as people come to report crime to them because of the lack of cop shops. Elwyn Fortune, of Mandela Park neighbourhood watch, said: &ldquo;We do not have police support. People come to our houses. We tell them we are not the police but they keep on coming to us.&rdquo; She added they ended up accompanying them to police stations to open cases. Barcelona community leader Lindeka July, from Gugulethu, said: &ldquo;Every weekend, over five people die in our area because of the lack of police in the townships.&rdquo; Residents of Mitchells Plain and Kraaifontein claimed the streets are dominated by gangsters because there is no police visibility. During the indaba, people agreed to take collective action to block the proposed R100 million upgrade of Muizenberg cop shop.SAPS&rsquo; Brigadier Novela Potelwa said: &ldquo;This is a department of public works project, which is in the design stage as part of the building&rsquo;s life cycle. That department will be able to answer enquiries.&rdquo; But Public Works spokesman Thami Mchunu said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the SAPS&rsquo; responsibility. We don&rsquo;t decide their budget.&rdquo;
