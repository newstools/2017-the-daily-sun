WHILE hundreds of residents gathered in churches for Easter, about 300 people from Zimbane occupied land they claimed had long been owed to them. On Saturday and Sunday, a huge crowd invaded an empty piece of land between Sidwadwa, Southernwood and Southridge Park in Mthatha, Eastern Cape. Gcina Zwakala, who led the occupation, said: &ldquo;We lodged a land claim in 1997 and were promised R300 million and land restitution. But to this day we have received nothing.&rdquo; He said they decided to take the land by force because King Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality was using it to dump waste. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame we have to suffer and remain homeless while stray animals gather in the field.&rdquo; Chief Nosizwe Maxhwele said the high court in Joburg granted them ownership of the land last month. &ldquo;We are waiting for the process to be finalised but I have supporting documents from the court proving the claimants are doing the right thing,&rdquo; she said. She said they planned to build homes and shopping complexes on the land. Public safety MMC Tshepo Machaea told the SunTeam he checked the documents and said what Zimbane residents was doing was legal.&ldquo;I was called to come and intervene but I found villagers peacefully working on their sites with a tractor. &ldquo;After addressing the chief we realised the move was legal,&rdquo; said Machea, who is also a resident of Zimbane. Municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza said he was unaware of the occupation. Daily Sun has published a number of reports about claimants being due for a massive pay-out, which was delayed by community squabbles.
