MAMELODI Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane says he is being targeted by opposition officials and threatened to quit South African football to seek employment in other countries if the trend continues.Mosimane had an altercation with Golden Arrows CEO Gordon Masondo next to the Downs bench following his charges&rsquo; 1-0 defeat to Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende in the Nedbank Cup Last 16 round at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Saturday. Their exit from Ke Yona was Downs&rsquo; sixth match without a win in all competitions.Mosimane was also involved in a heated dispute with Kaizer Chiefs security officials last week after his side lost 2-1 in an Absa Premiership match. Said Mosimane: &ldquo;You saw what happened against Chiefs, you saw what happened today. Masondo came right into my technical area. Maybe it&rsquo;s a plot against me. You know what will happen, maybe the PSL will take me out for a lot of games. &ldquo;I feel unprotected and when I react, they say I am a loose cannon or that I am not thinking straight.&rdquo;He added: &ldquo;Their coach (Clinton Larsen) came, we shook hands and there was no issue. But immediately after that things started happening. I know why, because we are Sundowns, a good team. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t target players, they target the one who leads the team and that&rsquo;s me. &ldquo;The camera is on me, Pitso is not keeping his cool. It&rsquo;s okay, it&rsquo;s part of life and I have to go through this. You guys will say anything about me, who cares?&rdquo;Mosimane said he could follow former Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp, who left the country due to pressure. &ldquo;I can go to Lesotho, it&rsquo;s not about money.&rdquo; However, Masondo lashed out at Mosimane for being a sore loser. &ldquo;After the referee blew his whistle I went to Manqoba Mngqithi (assistant coach) to shake his hand. I wanted to say they were unlucky, but better luck next time. &ldquo;Pitso took it upon himself to stop me shaking Manqoba&rsquo;s hand. He told me to f. . . off. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t condone what happened. I am sorry for those who watched on TV and at the stadium. But Pitso must learn to accept defeat. He should not be a bad loser. Does he hate me so much he won&rsquo;t allow me to shake his colleague&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; Masondo revealed this was not the first time he had an altercation with Mosimane.Added Masondo: &ldquo;Pitso disappointed me. I told him I used to love him but not anymore because he is big-headed. &ldquo;He thinks he is bigger than everybody else in this game. I&rsquo;ve lost respect for him. He fought with me for talking to his players while I was still at Black Aces.&rdquo;
