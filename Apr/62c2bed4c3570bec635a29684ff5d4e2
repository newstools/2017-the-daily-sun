THE stench of death hung over the house where the Ben 10 lived with his sickly old lover.But Ben 10 Happy Ngwenya (54) had an explanation for the smell. Apparently gogo Betty Majola wasn&rsquo;t able to go to the toilet any more.When he emerged on Sunday morning, telling neighbours gogo Betty had just died, they didn&rsquo;t believe him. They claimed Happy had been living with a corpse for days and only told them because he couldn&rsquo;t take the stink any more!Councillor Anthony Makhaye from Leslie, Mpumalanga said when they opened the door, they were greeted not only by the thick smell of death but by the fact that the gogo&rsquo;s body had started decomposing.Then Happy vanished and their suspicions grew. &ldquo;He has always been like this,&rdquo; said a neighbour, who did not want to be named. &ldquo;He would leave gogo Betty alone in the shack. He never cared for her. All he wanted was her money.&rdquo;When Happy finally pitched up about four hours later, he found the yard filled with angry neighbours baying for his blood. They only calmed down after he told them that he had rushed to town to buy electricity.Happy said what they were smelling was just kak and urine.&ldquo;Betty had been sick for two months. I had to put a bucket for her next to the bed. The smell was unbearable but I lived with it.&rdquo;He denied that he had only lived with gogo Betty for her money and asked for help to find her family because he can&rsquo;t afford to bury her. People who know gogo Betty&rsquo;s family, or who want to assist with her burial costs, should contact Councillor Makhaye on 071 358 2495 or Jabu on 071 183 3561.
