REPORTS suggesting Roger De Sa&rsquo;s next job could take him away from his family in Cape Town have disappointed Maritzburg United chairman Farook Kadodia. De Sa shocked everyone when he resigned from his position at the Team of Choice after less than three months in charge, citing family commitments. His main reason for dumping United was because his family in Cape Town couldn&rsquo;t cope without him and he wanted to be closer to them. Latest reports have it that De Sa could be in line to assist Stuart Baxter, should Baxter take the Bafana Bafana job. Another report alleges that he could be heading to SuperSport United as Baxter&rsquo;s replacement. Neither suggestion sits well with Kadodia. Said Kadodia: &ldquo;Make no mistake, if Roger takes a job outside Cape Town I will be really disappointed. He must have felt the pressure here after seven games &ndash; one win, one draw and five losses. That is not a good start for any coach. But we were fully behind him. &ldquo;I believe his experience would have helped Fadlu (Davids) elevate his career. That was the initial reason we brought him here. I also think if he stayed here longer and results were coming it would have been good for the team.&rdquo;Kadodia said, however, that his friendship with De Sa had not been dented by the way the former Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates coach left his team. &ldquo;As a person I don&rsquo;t have a problem with Roger. I&rsquo;ve had Ernst Middendorp leave and come back in the past. In football I&rsquo;ve realised you don&rsquo;t burn your bridges. &ldquo;I so wish coaches would realise that too.&rdquo;Kadodia&rsquo;s United will have a weekend off after they were eliminated from the Nedbank Cup by their neighbours Golden Arrows earlier. Their next match is away to struggling Pirates next Tuesday. Interim coach Davids will be looking to complete the double over Bucs in the Absa Premiership.
