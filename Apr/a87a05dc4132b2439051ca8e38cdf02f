GOLDEN Arrows reached the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup for the first time after beating Platinum Stars 1-0 at Princess Magogo Stadium yesterday.The last time Arrows won a trophy was eight years ago when they defeated Ajax Cape Town 6-0 in the MTN8 final.Arrows came into this match having beaten African champions Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in the Last-16 of the Ke Yona Cup while Dikwena defeated relegation threatened Baroka FC with the same margin.The home side got the game off to a good start, as they kept asking questions to the visiting side, but coach Cavin Johnson&rsquo;s defence was intact.Arrows coach Clinton Larsen made three changes from his squad that played against Ajax in their last encounter.Nkosinathi Mthiyane and Matome Mathiane were dropped to the bench for Limbikane Mzava, goal-scorer Musa Bilankulu, while Kagisho Dikgacoi came in for Kwanele Hlongwane, who was left out of the squad. Dikwena were also forced to make two changes, as their captain Vuyo Mere and Sphamandla Mlilo missed the encounter due to suspension.The two changes saw Kulekane Madondo slotting into midfield, with Ryan de Jongh dropping to defence in place of Mere.Arrows could have broken the deadlock in the 29th minute when striker Knox Mutizwa got a golden opportunity in a one-on-one situation with goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela, but the visiting side goalie did very well to deny Mutizwa.However, they finally got an opener in the 39th minute when captain Bilankulu headed in to give Arrows a 1-0 lead. They could have banged the second goal with a minute to half time but Kudakwashe Mahachi&rsquo;s goal-bound opportunity was deflected for corner.It was for the second time the two clubs met in the Ke Yona competition. Stars where victorious in 2009 when they won 6-5 via penalties in the first round.The Rustenburg outfit were the better side in the second half with Ndumiso Mabena and former Arrows player Bongi Ntuli putting immense pressure on the home side back four but the experience of Bilankulu came in handy for Larsen&rsquo;s charges.Stars were denied a penalty in the last five minutes of the game when Mthiyane handled the ball inside the box but referee Lwandile Mfiki saw otherwise.&nbsp;
