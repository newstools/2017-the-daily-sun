FOR years the residents said they had been haunted by spirits of people who were killed during political violence in the 1980s and 1990s. So on Sunday, Induna S&rsquo;khumbuzo Dladla performed a cleansing ritual.He realised the ancestors were not at peace when more than 10 residents at Folweni kasi, south of Durban, approached him, saying they had bad dreams. &ldquo;So much blood was shed in this area during the political wars many years ago,&rdquo; Dladla said. &ldquo;We took the dreams seriously because we didn&rsquo;t want more blood to flow.&rdquo; The induna said residents went to a nearby mountain to be cleansed with bile from a slaughtered goat. Community member Thulebona Khanyile (76) said: &ldquo;I first dreamt of many naked women and men standing on a mountain, covered in blood, in 2006. &ldquo;I recognised most of them and realised they were locals who died during political violence. One of them told me our area must be cleansed, or else blood would flow in the future.&rdquo; Thembelenkosini Shezi (69) said the spirits first visited him in a dream in 2015. &ldquo;I dreamt of residents who died a long time ago. They were full of blood and said the induna must perform a cleansing ritual in order for them to rest in peace.&rdquo;
