Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret has a near full strength squad to choose from for Saturday nights Nedbank Cup quarter-final against Bloemfontein Celtic.This is following the news that wingers Thabo Rakhale and Thabo Qalinge are back in full training and could potentially feature on Saturday for what would be their first appearances of the year.With a full-strength and on-form side (Bucs have won three and drawn one of their last five games), the Swede though may think twice about making too many changes.And he hopes to help Pirates win the competition in his first season with the club, having only arrived a couple of months ago."We had goals that we wanted to achieve this season and one of those goals was to win the Nedbank Cup," Jonevret said."So far it's been good and we're happy with that, so we're just hopeful that we can go through to the final and eventually win it for the chairman and for the supporters as well."Celtic meanwhile will be led into the game by caretaker coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka after Luc Eymael was instructed by the PSL Resolution Chamber to return to his former club, Polokwane City.Phunya Sele Sele have been in decent form of late, winning three, drawing two and losing just once in their last six outings in all competitions, a 2-0 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs in their most recent action.The Buccaneers defeated Free State Stars 4-1 in the previous round, while Celtic edged out second tier side Mbombela United 2-1.
