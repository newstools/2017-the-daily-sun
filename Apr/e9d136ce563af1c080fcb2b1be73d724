Defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns recorded their first league victory in six matches after thumping SuperSport United 5-0 at Loftus Versfeld on Thursday night.It was one-way traffic from the kick-off and pretty much right through the game as Sundowns put their city rivals under relentless pressure and scored three times before half an hour had been played.The fourth and fifth goals came either side of half-time and effectively killed off the match as a contest.The Brazilians made a very purposeful start to the game and it took two fine saves from Reyaad Pieterse to keep Percy Tau from scoring within the opening four minutes.But there was nothing the SuperSport keeper could do just a couple of minutes later when Tau's cross ballooned up off Clayton Daniels' outstretched leg and went in for an own-goal.Hlompho Kekana was close to doubling Downs' lead in the 13th minute when his header hit the woodwork.The next goal arrived shortly afterwards, though, when Tebogo Langerman's cross was deflected into the path of Themba Zwane, who slotted in from close range.Mzikayise Mashaba added the third goal when he beat Pieterse from a tight angle after a lovely back-heel assist from Khama Billiat.There was time for a fourth goal before half-time, Billiat finishing clinically from the right-hand side of the box with a low shot from 20 yards out which snuck in off the far post.Matsatsantsa had a couple of efforts on goal after the break, but Brazilians keeper Denis Onyango saved Daniels' header and Aubrey Modiba's tame shot.Any hopes of getting back into the game, though, were crushed when Billiat got his second of the night after clinically side-footing in Langerman's square-ball.Daniels had another header saved by Onyango while Pieterse kept out an Anthony Laffor shot late on as the game played out without too much further action after Sundowns' fifth goal.
