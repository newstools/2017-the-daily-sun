WHEN residents heard the screams of a woman whose shack was on fire on Monday, they rushed to help.But a three-week-old baby was burned to death because they only managed to save the mum and her other child. Police have bust her for murder. She has been accused of causing the death of her own baby in Pholile squatter camp in Lwandle, Strand. The mum was allegedly given money to buy the baby nappies, but instead she bought booze. The angry father allegedly assaulted her, and she locked herself inside the shack with her three-week-old baby and one-year-old child. After she set the shack on fire, she escaped with the older child, leaving the baby inside. Three shacks were gutted, leaving nine people homeless. Firefighters quickly contained the fire. A resident told the SunTeam: &ldquo;I know her and she likes to drink, and what she did is wrong, killing a child. &ldquo;It was stupid of her in the first place to burn the house. I wish it was her who could not escape.&rdquo; Councillor Jongidumo Maxheke said: &ldquo;Domestic violence is a challenge because it can get out of hand. Look at what has happened now.&rdquo; Cape Town fire services spokeswoman Liezl Moodie confirmed the incident. &ldquo;The city&rsquo;s fire and rescue service responded to wood and iron structures burning in Pholile Street, Lwandle, at 5.55pm on Monday.&ldquo;Three large wood and iron structures were affected by the fire. One child sustained fatal burns.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said: &ldquo;This office can confirm that there was a shack fire on Monday at about 5.30pm, and a three-week-old baby boy burned to death. &ldquo;A murder case was opened for investigation. &ldquo;The 35-year-old mum was arrested and will appear in the Strand Magistrates Court.&rdquo;A similar incident took place at the squatter camp two weeks ago, when fire killed a family of five.
