HLAUDI is looking forward to his upcoming disciplinary hearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to enjoy that second hearing. I&rsquo;m going to walk away as after the first,&rdquo; he said.A proud Hlaudi Motsoeneng was clearly enjoying himself at the media briefing at Garden Court, Milpark, in Joburg organised by a group calling themselves The Friends of Hlaudi.More than once he said: &ldquo;Remember, there is only one Hlaudi!&rdquo; as he talked and smiled.Hlaudi claimed the parliamentary ad hoc committee accusing him of taking decisions by himself meant he was powerful. &ldquo;I won the debates during discussions and people applauded me. Now they say I took decisions alone.&rdquo; He described former SABC board member Krish Naidoo, also a member of the newly appointed interim SABC board, as a sell-out. &ldquo;If the whole board was a mess, why is he still there?&rdquo;He said all broadcasters must be regulated to play 90% local content. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to black people who have been taken in by Westerners.&rdquo; He added he will never be proud to hear a black person not supporting President Zuma when he speaks of radical transformation.Hlaudi said he enjoyed being fired and coming back again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fighter. That&rsquo;s why the parliamentary committee was afraid to call me.&rdquo; He said even if some people hated him, he would rule them in some place, somewhere and if he becomes a politician, he will not oppose a woman presidential candidate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time a woman got a chance as president.&rdquo;
