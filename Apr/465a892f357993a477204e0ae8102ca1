EACH time rape accused Kaugelo Monareng appeared in court, he demanded that Magistrate Elmarie Theron and Prosecutor Matume Maake excuse themselves because he said they were biased.When he appeared in court again on Thursday, he repeated his demands. His trial went to recess for him to cool off in the holding cells.The 24-year-old from Thulamahashe, near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, appeared in the Mhala Regional Court on eight counts of rape. He had pleaded not guilty to all charges despite forensic evidence linking him to the rape cases.After a forensic expert detailed all the evidence against him, Monareng stood up and told Theron that since she refused to excuse herself from his case, she should sentence herself and he would sit back and bear witness to that. When Theron ordered cops to return him to the holding cells to cool off, all hell broke loose. Monareng told the three cops to step back or he would moer them. More men in blue were called in to apprehend Monareng, who gave the cops a few nasty bruises. While being dragged away by police he screamed: &ldquo;I have a right to remain in the courtroom. My rights are being violated here. I will deal with these cops.&rdquo; After recess Monareng was brought back into the courtroom to hear Warrant Officer Evans Mashego&rsquo;s testimony. Mashego said the accused was arrested on 9 January 2013 on a rape offence committed in Bushbuckridge. DNA has since linked him to eight cases of rape. The violations were committed in Bushbuckridge, Dwaarsloop and Xanthia.&ldquo;On his arrest he was in possession of a cellphone belonging to one of his victims.&rdquo; Theron postponed the matter until tomorrow. She urged the accused to co-operate when he next appeared in court.
