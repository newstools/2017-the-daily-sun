DAKALANI Mulaudzi&rsquo;s first priority is safety.The 39-year-old security guard from Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung fenced his shack to keep thugs from stealing his hard-earned possessions.He said after criminals broke into his shack twice last year, he had no choice but to start building a fence around it. He said: &ldquo;My neighbourhood is a hot spot for robberies and housebreakings.&ldquo;When I fell victim to housebreaking last year, I decided to do something about the matter. &ldquo;Now I can sleep like a baby instead of worrying about who will burst into my home while I am away. &ldquo;I have peace of mind now that my property is safe. &ldquo;I work as a security guard, so I have to protect myself before I protect others. &ldquo;It is easy for someone to jump in and out of a big yard, but it is difficult to jump over a fence that is right next to a shack.&ldquo;My community takes the law into their own hands and that always lands them in trouble. &ldquo;I fenced my shack because cops don&rsquo;t assist housebreaking victims unless they come forward with a suspect&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;I did not even bother to open a case when thugs broke into my house last year.&ldquo;I knew it would be a waste of time because police have never recovered any of my neighbour&rsquo;s stolen goods. &ldquo;The police officers in our area are failing us.&rdquo; Malile Ralesoetsa (37), a neighbour, said: &ldquo;Dakalani did the right thing by putting a fence around his shack. &ldquo;I also want him to do the same for me.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said: &ldquo;Dakalane should go to his nearest police station and ask to meet with station commander about his matter. &ldquo;He can also ask for more cops to patrol the area.&rdquo;
