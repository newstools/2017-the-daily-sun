THEY say three bulls can never share a kraal. But that obviously doesn&rsquo;t apply to these women.Just ask sangoma Doctor Mokoena, who shares his shack with his three wives!These women from Tsakane in Ekurhuleni cook and eat together, and they all sleep in one big bed.Also in the shack are their six children.First wife Nene Ngwenya told Daily Sun that at first their neighbours used to think they were crazy to share one man.&ldquo;But because we remain united and happy, they don&rsquo;t have a problem with it any more.&rdquo;Daily Sun witnessed how the women take care of each other&rsquo;s children.&ldquo;We are like sisters and we help each other out. &ldquo;Our unity is even envied by those who see us for the first time,&rdquo; said Nene.Third wife Makhosi Ntuli said she was happy with how their husband treated them.Doctor said the only way to manage polygamy was for the man to have a backbone.&ldquo;Treat your wives equally and don&rsquo;t take sides. &ldquo;Always listen to their complaints and be neutral and fair at all times.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not rich but I know how to make my wives happy. We share the little we have and try to instil the same values in our children,&rdquo; he said.Doctor said when he wanted to take a third wife three years ago, he sat down with his two wives to get their permission and see if they were okay with it. &ldquo;I respect them and I listen to them when they are not happy with my decisions.&rdquo;
