South Africa have fallen two places in the latest Fifa World Rankings, dropping to number 64 on the global list.Bafana Bafana defeated Guinea-Bissau and drew with Angola last month, but did not get enough rankings points out of those two matches to move up the list.The side are positioned as the 12th best side in Africa, well off Safa&rsquo;s stated aim of being among the top three on a regular basis.Among the teams they are facing in World Cup and African Nations Cup qualifiers this year, Nigeria were perhaps the best movers.Bafana&rsquo;s next competitive fixture is against the Super Eagles in a Nations Cup qualifier in June, with the Nigerians positioned at number 40 in the world and fifth in Africa.Their other Nations Cup qualification rivals are Libya (91 in the world, 23 in Africa) and Seychelles (196 in the world, 51 in Africa).Senegal, who South Africa meet in the World Cup preliminaries, are at number 30 in the world and second in Africa, behind the continent&rsquo;s top side Egypt (19 in the world).Burkina Faso are also riding high at 35 in the world and fourth in Africa, while the third side in the World Cup qualification pool, Cape Verde, have continued their slide.The west Africans are now 83 in the world and 17th in Africa, just two years after they had briefly reached the summit of the continental list.&nbsp;South Africa will face the Cape Verdeans in a home and away double header in late August and early September. -SUPERSPORT.COM
