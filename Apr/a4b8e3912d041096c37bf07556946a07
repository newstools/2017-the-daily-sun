RESIDENTS refused to offer support at the Umlazi Magistrates Court on Friday for the murder case against five men accused of killing a 15-year-old and cutting up his body. This was because they said the victim, Phiwayinkosi Mhlongo, was a thug who used to terrorise them.Phiwayinkosi&rsquo;s head was found in a sewage drain, while his body was found at a school not far from his house in G section of Umlazi, south of Durban. His testicles were found at a third location near the school. People believe members of his former gang killed him. Five suspects were charged with murder and two of them were also charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm. Only Councillor Sithenjwa Nyawose went to court. He said: &ldquo;Although the victim had changed his ways, residents were still angry that he had terrorised them. They said they wouldn&rsquo;t get involved because the matter was between thugs.&rdquo; Phiwayinkosi&rsquo;s mum, Thoko Mtshali (54), said she and her family had stayed at home because they feared for their lives. &ldquo;Our lives are in danger because there are people who have still not been arrested.&rdquo; National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Natasha Ramkisson-Kara said she would find out this week in court what had hppened, and how old the accused was.The suspects were kept in custody and are expected to apply for bail on Wednesday.
