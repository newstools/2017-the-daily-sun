Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane hailed Cristiano Ronaldo as a unique player after the Portuguese forward scored a hat-trick against Bayern Munich to send the Spanish side through to the Champions League semi-finals.The 32-year-old Ronaldo struck three times, including his 100th Champions League goal, as Real beat their German rivals 6-3 on aggregate after extra-time to advance to the last four of Europe's premier club competition.Zidane said about Ronaldo after the game: "He has shown that in the key moments, he is there. He makes the difference."When he has to be, he is. He is unique and we are happy for him and for the team. And for the people who have helped us in the Bernabeu."However, the victory did not come without controversy as Ronaldo was shown to be in an offside position when he scored his second goal while Arturo Vidal was harshly sent off for the visitors.Zidane though played down his side's controversial win saying it was deserved.The Frenchman mentor said: "We played against the best team by the way, but we scored six goals and they scored three, so we deserved to go through," Zidane said."We had a lot of chances in the first half and then we were not comfortable."
