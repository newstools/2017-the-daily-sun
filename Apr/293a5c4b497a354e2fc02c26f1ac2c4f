AN ANGRY crowd marched to the Constitutional Court yesterday demanding that banks be stopped from repossessing houses and reselling them illegally. The residents of Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni said more than 300 families from the area had lost their houses through questionable transactions since 1999.They said some of the affected home owners had paid off their bonds. Close to 200 community members marched to the court in Joburg, saying their rights as property owners needed to be respected. The march was led by the South African Communist Party, the South African Students&rsquo; Congress, the South African National Civic Organisation and Masakhane members. The SACP&rsquo;s Mphikeleli Dlamini- Masondo said vulnerable people had been targeted. &ldquo;In most cases, old people and children who had inherited their parents&rsquo; houses were evicted. These people ended up homeless,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;You cannot kick a person out of their house without giving them an alternative place to stay. And how can you evict people from RDP houses? &ldquo;As far as we know, those houses are not transferable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every day people are becoming homeless and people turn a blind eye to their situation.&rdquo; Some of the matters addressed in their memorandum of grievances included repossession, the involvement of cops in illegal evictions and unlicensed agents being used to execute illegal evictions.The marchers gave the Constitutional Court until 30 July to respond. Constitutional Court manager Thomas Rikhotso received the memorandum and assured the marchers they would be given feedback.
