ROAD accidents happen in a split second but can result in lifelong suffering and hardship. A driver, passenger or pedestrian who respects the rules of the road makes the difference between a safe arrival or life-changing consequences. * Nomfundo Khoza&rsquo;s Story In 2011, Nomfundo, from Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga was walking on the side of the road when she was knocked down by a truck. Unaware that he was dragging Nomfundo under the truck, the driver continued driving until a following motorist managed to stop him.How the accident changed Nomfundo&rsquo;s life Nomfundo lost her right leg and needs full-time supervision and assistance. She can no longer work and relies on her daughter, *Deliwe Khoza, for support and assistance.Ongoing interventions by the RAF An RAF Undertaking Certificate was issued to Nomfundo.This is an agreement between the claimant and the fund to provide for the crash survivor&rsquo;s current and future medical needs relating to injuries sustained.RAF field case manager, Maropeng Manabalala, was assigned to Nomfundo and his first task was to create a rehabilitation plan which included making changes to her house, such as installing a ramp and bathroom grab bars, physiotherapy, wheelchairs and prosthetics.Manabalala visits claimants at least once every two months and submits a report. RAF field case managers Field case managers bridge the gap between the RAF offices and claimants&rsquo; homes, acting as the RAF foot soldiers who consult claimants in their homes.They advise them about the RAF&rsquo;s functions and take care of victims after the accident. They are the contact people, and claimants may contact or send a Call Back message to them. Nomfundo and her daughter&rsquo;s advice for pedestrians is to be alert at all times; not to assume that drivers can see you; to make sure cars have stopped before crossing the road and to obey the rules of the road.For more information on the RAF and its services, phone the Call Centre 0860 23 55 23, between 7.45am and 4pm.The RAF has five regional offices in Joburg: Menlyn (Pretoria)DurbanEast LondonCape TownFive customer service centres are based in: Nelspruit) Kimberley) Polokwane) Mahikeng) BloemfonteinWalk-in-centres are located in: Vhembe (Limpopo)) Port Elizabeth) Mamelodi) Mthatha) Newcastle) Beaufort WestThere are 100 hospital service centres countrywide.
