KAIZER Chiefs came from behind to beat 10-man ABC Motsepe side Acornbush United 2-1 and qualify for the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals yesterday. Substitute Gustavo Paez scored twice in the second half to give Chiefs victory. Thulani Sidumo found the back of the net for Acornbush in the first half.The Mpumalanga side didn&rsquo;t let Chiefs dictate the terms on the field and held their own, using their home ground advantage and the weather conditions, which suited them well.Steve Komphela&rsquo;s charges may have thought it would be easy getting the better of the third tier team, but the hosts were out to prove that their Last 32 round victory over title-chasers Cape Town City was not a fluke. Acornbush&rsquo;s defence was tight, they were able to close down Amakhosi on several occasions in the first half and keeper Sibusiso Masuku also played his part in keeping the visitors from finding the back of the net.Masuku gave a Man-of-the-Match performance as he made sure that the score remained respectable.Even after Sandy Nyathi got a red card in the first half, the hosts didn&rsquo;t bow down to the Glamour Boys.Komphela can&rsquo;t have been pleased with his players&rsquo; inability to crack the Acornbush defence and get goals, with Joseph Molangoane, Willard Kitsande and Siphiwe Tshabalala all missing goal-scoring opportunities.The second half of the match was more physical, with players from both sides not backing down during challenges, resulting in several clashes and injuries. Acornbush were the more unfortunate of the two, losing substitute Siboniso Khumalo to injury just a few minutes after stepping onto the field. Molangoane was lucky not to receive a card for the foul on Khumalo, who had to be stretchered off the field.
