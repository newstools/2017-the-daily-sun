UNIVERSITY of Limpopo students took to the streets yesterday to hunt down thugs. This follows a spate of robberies outside the Turfloop campus. The latest incident took place at the weekend during a bash at the campus, when students say they were robbed of their belongings. The students took to the streets to hunt down the suspects, whom they claim to be nyaope addicts who rob them on a daily basis and sometimes rape women students. Two men were caught just outside the university entrance. The suspects &ndash; who were pleading for their lives &ndash; were rescued by the cops, who took them away before they could be assaulted. SRC deputy president Given Malatjie said students, especially those renting accommodation outside campus, are being targeted daily. &ldquo;We have identified the nyaope addicts. They make our lives difficult. We are even afraid to hang our clothes on wash-lines because they steal them,&rdquo; said Given. Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they have established a provincial task team to look into the cases. &ldquo;We have arrested three suspects.&rdquo;
