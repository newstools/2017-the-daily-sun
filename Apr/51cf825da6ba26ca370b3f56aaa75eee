LINDIWE Tshezi (57) has claimed her dead brother is blocking her blessings. &ldquo;There was bad blood between myself and my brother before he died,&rdquo; said Lindiwe.She said her brother is buried on top of her father. And this has created big problems!&ldquo;My father used to hear me and things were happening according to plan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But since my brother was placed on top of him, things are no longer going right for me. &ldquo;I used to see my father in my dreams a lot but now I don&rsquo;t see him anymore.&rdquo;That is why Lindiwe from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, believes that when she goes to the cemetery to perform rituals at her father&rsquo;s grave to ask for his blessings, her requests no longer reach him.&ldquo;I feel so hopeless now. I can&rsquo;t speak to my ancestor,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My brother was an evil, selfish and arrogant person who didn&rsquo;t want anything good coming to me and my family. &ldquo;He treated us so badly and we just didn&rsquo;t want him.&rdquo;Lindiwe said when he died, his children insisted that he be buried on top of her father. &ldquo;My two sisters and myself tried to dispute it &ndash; but it was our word against the family elders, who supported the cause.&ldquo;He was buried in the same grave as our father.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our father can&rsquo;t even breathe. It&rsquo;s not African to bury one person on top of another.&rdquo;Lindiwe said they are wondering how they will perform the rituals on Good Friday.Sangoma Magotweni Khoza said Lindiwe will not get blessings as long as her dead enemy brother is buried on top of her father. &ldquo;The family must buy a cow or goat to make a ceremony to separate the two,&rdquo; he said.
