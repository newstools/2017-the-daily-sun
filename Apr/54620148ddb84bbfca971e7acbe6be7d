COSATU says only two of its 17 affiliates are against President Jacob Zuma addressing its May Day rally in Bloemfontein on Monday. The federation said it had no doubt that Zuma would face a hostile crowd at the event. This comes after Nehawu and the Communication Workers&rsquo; Union apparently wrote to the federation requesting that Zuma&rsquo;s invitation to address the rally be withdrawn. Nehawu suggested that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should attend. Referring to a central executive committee resolve that Zuma should resign, the union wrote: &ldquo;Nehawu believes that inviting the president of the ANC to address any of our upcoming May Day rallies, particularly the main rally in Bloemfontein, will create conflicting messages for our members, workers and the public in general.&rdquo; Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla said affiliates were misunderstanding the executive committee resolution. He said the resolution was that Zuma should resign as state president, but not ANC president. &ldquo;The invite for the May Day rally was sent to Luthuli House and not the Union Buildings. The ANC is the one who deployed him and we cannot tell the ANC who to deploy to alliance events.&rdquo;Pamla said the media had only seen letters from two affiliates, which had leaked. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know about the views of the other 15 affiliates and we are not going to share them. &ldquo;We are not going to be forced to respond to the views of two affiliates,&rdquo; he said.
