A NASTY fight is said to be brewing between Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and her nephew, Msuthu Madikizela (34).The fight is so bad that the entire Madikizela clan has allegedly turned against the ANC stalwart. Msuthu, who grew up in Zambia, claims that Winnie took his money for herself. &ldquo;Our father, Sthembiso Stanford Madikizela, died in exile in 1986 and was buried there. &ldquo;He was Winnie&rsquo;s brother, and was the driver for both Nelson Mandela and OR Tambo. When my father died, he left a lot of money for us. But Winnie claimed all that money for herself. &ldquo;We found that she lied and said we died along with our father,&rdquo; said Msuthu, who has two brothers: Nkululeko and Zolile. He said Zolile was serving time in prison. Msuthu claimed Winnie ignored them when they asked about the money. &ldquo;Instead, she took us to the Eastern Cape, to Bizana at Embhongweni and performed a welcoming ceremony for us. She said this was to welcome us into the Madikizela clan,&rdquo; Msuthu claimed. &ldquo;But now we can see this was just a way to brainwash us. She took us back to Jozi to stay with her. And that&rsquo;s when the ill-treatment started. She turned me into her bodyguard, but I never received any salary. I asked her about this, and she promised me a proper job. &ldquo;Other politicians wanted to assist as they knew my father from exile. But Winnie discouraged me from accepting those jobs. She&rsquo;d say I deserved something better because I was her family,&rdquo; said Msuthu. &ldquo;I fell for her tricks.&rdquo; Certain Madikizela family members confirmed Winnie had ill-treated her nephews. A family member, who asked not to be named, said: &ldquo;The country respects Winnie, but as her family, we&rsquo;re deeply hurt by her. The pain she has caused to her nephews and us is unbearable. We want to know who killed Sthembiso in exile. &ldquo;The least she can do is bring Sthembiso&rsquo;s remains back to South Africa, so we can have closure. We&rsquo;ve approached her several times, but she&rsquo;s avoiding the subject.&rdquo; Winnie could not be reached for comment. Her PA Zodwa Zwane said: &ldquo;Winnie is not well. She&rsquo;s not doing any interviews. Please, send an email.&rdquo; The SunTeam sent an email, but there was no response.
