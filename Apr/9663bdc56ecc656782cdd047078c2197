SAMMY Modau is obsessed with cleanliness and doesn&rsquo;t want any dirt in his clean yard.Whenever he sees rubbish lying around his yard, Sammy points his finger at his neighbours, Kholiswa Ndletyana (60) and her son Sivile (35).After being arrested more than 15 times, the mum and son from Snake Park in Soweto have had enough!&ldquo;He says we throw rubbish in his yard. We have been arrested numerous times by Dobsonville cops. What surprises us is that he doesn&rsquo;t have proof and yet the cops still arrest us. My son has lost a job because we are constantly being arrested,&rdquo; claimed Kholiswa. She added that her neighbour from hell is an albino and he always tells the court that they call him iswafi or inkawu.&ldquo;It is sad that the court believes him. We are tired of living like this. I&rsquo;m too old for this.&rdquo;Kholiswa said they appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court lastweek on Friday and the case was postponed for further investigation. They are currently out on bail of R500 each.Daily Sun spoke to Sammy, who insisted the Ndletyanas were throwing rubbish in his yard.&ldquo;Yes, I live next to a dumpsite but I can tell the difference between rubbish that was thrown by someone and that blown in by the wind. They keep calling me iswafi or inkawu. That&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; said Sammy.A case of intimidation is also being investigated by Dobsonville cops.
