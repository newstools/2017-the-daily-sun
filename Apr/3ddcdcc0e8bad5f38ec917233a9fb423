BONISILE Mtubane-Dlamini was traumatised when people stole her husband&rsquo;s body in the early hours of yesterday morning. The 36-year-old woman from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni was preparing to bury her husband when her in-laws stormed in with guns and pangas, demanding that the body be released. Bonisile told Daily Sun when she and her family refused to hand over the body, about 30 armed relatives of her late husband, Kenneth Dlamini (48), started firing shots and threatening to kill anyone who stood in their way. They grabbed the coffin as mourners ran for cover. The police arrived but instead of taking action, they told the two families to negotiate. However, Kenneth&rsquo;s family refused to do so. They said they couldn&rsquo;t allow Kenneth to be buried by a woman. &ldquo;We want to bury our brother according to our culture and not hers. He&rsquo;s going to be buried under a rock on a mountain in Swaziland,&rdquo; said a relative. The police arrested one of the armed men for pointing a gun.Bonisile&rsquo;s in-laws ended up leaving with the body. &ldquo;I spent more than R20 000 on this funeral. All the food I bought is going to waste. I want them to compensate me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My in-laws didn&rsquo;t have a problem when I told them my husband wanted to be buried in Tsakane. I am surprised by what they did. My children will not know where their father&rsquo;s body is.&rdquo; Bonisile claimed her in-laws warned her they would be coming back. &ldquo;I live in fear because I heard some of them saying they want my husband&rsquo;s three cars.&rdquo; Cops say a case of intimidation was opened at Tsakane Police Station and one suspect was arrested.
