THABANG Mazibuko says he&rsquo;s tired of living in darkness and messing up people&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; The 23-year-old from Protea, Soweto told Daily Sun he got involved in evil practices a few years ago.&nbsp; &ldquo;I owned a car wash but I was not satisfied with the money I was making. A man who had recently moved to my kasi told me he could make me a millionaire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thabang said the man took him to a woman in Natalspruit and told him he was going to thwasa.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told them my parents wouldn&rsquo;t allow it but then we went to my home and put muthi on the gate and they became submissive.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was then taken to a river. Two pythons followed me. The gobela said one was my grandmum and the other my granddad. That same day I had my thwasa ceremony.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thabang was sent home with the two snakes in a basket. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t go home and ended up spending five weeks in the veld. I felt like I was losing my mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;To my surprise, on the day I went home, I found my gobela dancing with my parents for a homecoming ceremony,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I saw my gobela, I had flashbacks of night vigils where we dressed in black and held red candles to influence people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thabang said the man who took him to thwasa had an indumba in his shack.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is able to lure you in and you will agree to do whatever he does. He has a mirror which he looks into to do people harm,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Thabang is now staying with a prophet who is praying for him.&nbsp;
