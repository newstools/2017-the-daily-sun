Barcelona manager Luis Enrique said his team will aim to score five goals as they look to overturn a three goal deficit against Juventus in the 2nd leg of their Champions League quarter-final clash.Barca were completely outplayed in the first leg as the Italian champions sailed to a comfortable 3-0 victory in Turin.The Spanish side will however draw on their experience in the previous round when they produced the best comeback in the history of the competition to advance to the last eight.Barca were 4-0 down going into the second leg of their last 16 tie against PSG but beat the French club 6-1 at home in what was described as a miracle performance and Enrique said his team will play without any pressure.The Spanish mentor said: "Bearing in mind the opponent could have chances and the goal can come at any moment, our objective is to score five."We don't have anything to lose. We are free from pressure. Juventus have the semi-finals in their pocket and will have to decide whether to sit back or attack."We only have one option which is to attack, attack and attack again."I am sure that if we score the first goal, the Camp Nou will score the second and the third will come of its own accord."
