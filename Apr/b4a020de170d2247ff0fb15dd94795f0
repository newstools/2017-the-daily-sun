SUPERSPORT United&rsquo;s hopes of lifting the Absa Premiership title are slowly fading away!SuperSport have went three games without a win in the league following their 1-0 defeat to Tshwane rivals Mamelodi Sundowns at Lucas Moripe Stadium on Wednesday night.United were looking for revenge after going down 5-0 to Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld Stadium last Thursday. But the Brazilians kept their composure intact, as they denied United any goal scoring chances.United have failed to collect any points from their last three league games.United&rsquo;s 19 match unbeaten run came to an abrupt end when they lost to Baroka FC 1-0 few weeks ago before going down twice to Sundowns.Downs got a winning goal with seven minutes to be played through Hlompho Kekana&rsquo;s glancing header to stay at fourth position with 44 points from 22 games. Matsatsantsa A Pitori sit 5th position in the log with 37 points from 23 games.&nbsp;Masandawana could have broken the deadlock with a minute on the clock but Khama Billiat&rsquo;s shot was well saved by goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, who replaced former Kaizer Chiefs keeper Reyaad Pieterse.As he was looking for a sweeter revenge Coach Stuart Baxter made three changes from his squad with Williams replacing Pieterse while Aubrey Modiba and Teboho Mokoena replaced Mandla Masango and Thuso Phala respectively.&nbsp;However, the two youngsters had little impact in the middle of the park as Jeremy Brockie and Kingston Nkhatha failed to test goalkeeper Denis Onyango in the first half.Baxter&rsquo;s charges will hope things turn around when they play on-form Kaizer Chiefs in a league game next week Saturday at Mbombela Stadium.&nbsp;
