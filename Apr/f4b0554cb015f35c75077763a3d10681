POLICE in Limpopo are still searching for suspects who burnt four trucks belonging to mining companies in Phalaborwa. The suspects, believed to be community members, allegedly went on the rampage on Tuesday night. They barricaded roads with branches, rocks and burning tyres.According to Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, police managed to protect seven more trucks that were found lined up to be set on fire. &ldquo;The trucks were safely escorted out of the parking depot. On Tuesday night a group of people allegedly started barricading the roads at Makhushane crossroads. The police were notified and reacted swiftly. The suspects are not yet known and no one has been arrested,&rdquo; Ngoepe said.The recent rampage is believed to be a continuation of a protest two weeks ago in Namakgale, where a truck was also burnt. In August 2015, three mining companies&rsquo; vehicles were set on fire in a protest by community members who were complaining that the Phalaborwa companies were not hiring locals.Police warned motorists to treat the area with caution.
