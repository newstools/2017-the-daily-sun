ANGRY residents of Orlando East, Soweto want revenge for the brutal murder of Tinyiko Reckson. The five-year-old boy was yesterday killed by an unknown attacker. The residents say his death was no accident, but a sacrificial killing, because it was just a few days before Good Friday. According to witness Lipolelo Boboke (34), the killer was dressed in a church uniform. She said: &ldquo;I was bathing when I heard a child who lives in the back room screaming for help. &ldquo;I went to check as the screams were hysterical and frightening. To my shock I found a man sitting on top of the boy.&rdquo;Lipolelo said as she approached, the man pulled out a knife and stabbed the boy three times in the neck.&ldquo;I only realised it was Tinyiko when the man lifted his head to suck his blood. I froze in shock. I have never seen anything like this. &ldquo;After sucking the boy&rsquo;s blood, the man stared at him while still sitting on top of him. I screamed for help, but he didn&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;Lipolelo said the killer only moved when he was given a klap by a man who responded to her screams. The killer tried to run away but was caught by residents and beaten.Furious Andries Ndlovu (30) said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the school holidays and our children want to play freely. They can&rsquo;t because there are vampires out to get their blood in broad daylight. This man should have been killed.&rdquo; Residents have vowed to find his home and burn it down.The little boy&rsquo;s mum, Rosina Mosioa, was too traumatised to speak to the media. SAPS spokesman Kay Makhubele said a case of murder had been opened. &ldquo;A 21-year-old suspect was arrested and will appear in court soon. &ldquo;We have asked for the family to be given space to mourn as their loss is hard for them to come to terms with.&rdquo;
