Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola conceded that his side won't be able to win the Premier League this season, after suffering a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea on Wednesday.An Eden Hazard brace secured all three points for the Blues while Sergio Aguero was on the scoresheet for Guardiola's side at Stamford Bridge.After the match, Guardiola once again said that his side deserved to win on the night, after making similar comments about their 3-1 defeat to Antonio Conte's side in the reverse fixture in December."Absolutely (we were better)., but they got six points and we got zero," Guardiola told the media after the match."Football is about results - but the way we play today, all I can say is I am happier than Arsenal when we won one point and here we lost."We compete against a top team with Hazard, Pedro, (Diego) Costa."But the way we play, I am so satisfied - I'm a lucky guy."I'm a lucky guy to be manager of that club and especially these players to come here to Stamford bridge and play with huge personality."I don't have regrets complaints. They know when I'm not happy."We go into the locker room and I say that is not the right way."But when they do what they have to do there is nothing to say."The result leaves City 12 points off the pace and in fourth place on the Premier League table, with just eight matches left in the season. With the FA Cup City's only realistic chance of silverware remaining in the season, Guardiola admitted that he has turned his focus to next season."We have to analyse what we do for next season and we take another solution because we are here to win games," he added."For the manager to say how good we play is not enough."
