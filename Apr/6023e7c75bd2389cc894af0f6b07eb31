BIDVEST WITS CEO, Jose Ferreira, says winning the Absa Premiership title is non-negotiable.The Clever Boys are in a strong position to clinch their first league title in the Premier Soccer League era and the big boss has promised to reward them handsomely if they bring the title home.The Clever Boys sacrificed the Nedbank Cup title in favour of winning the league.Wits were beaten 5-4 on penalties by National First Division side, Jomo Cosmos, on Tuesday after their game ended in a 1-1 draw after extra-time.Ferreira was not upset by the cup exit, and described it as a blessing in disguise.The Students are chasing the bigger carrot &ndash; the league title.The message to the players is clear from top management: win the league title at all cost.The Clever Boys are second on the log with 41 points and they trail log leaders Cape Town City FC by one point with two games in hand. But games in hand do not guarantee points and Ferreira knows that well.Ferreira said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a good position in the league. We&rsquo;re in such a strong position and we stand a big chance to win it. &ldquo;The league is a priority for this club this season. With each game, we are getting closer to winning the title.&rdquo; Ferreira told SunSport that the next two months are crucial for his side.&ldquo;It is coach Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s fourth season with the Clever Boys,&rdquo; he said.Hunt has helped the club win the MTN8 title, but the league title will serve as the biggest title they have won in recent years.Ferreira went on: &ldquo;We have a massive 10 league games still to play and we can&rsquo;t afford to put the foot wrong forward. &ldquo;Year in and year out we&rsquo;re competing for the title, and this time we have to win it.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been in the top three in the last three seasons and that shows Gavin is doing a good job,&rdquo; he said. Any of the team in the top five can still win the league title. But Ferreira is not scared of the challenge posed by other teams.
