LEICESTER City&rsquo;s defeat to Everton at the weekend snapped a six-game winning streak, but the Foxes must regain their momentum for the first leg of their Uefa Champions League quarterfinal against Atletico Madrid tonight, defender Ben Chilwell has said.Leicester suffered their first defeat under interim manager Craig Shakespeare on Sunday, going down 4-2 at Goodison Park, but Chilwell said they had no time to feel sorry for themselves ahead of the &ldquo;massive match&rdquo; in Madrid.&ldquo;Everyone is confident going into it even though we lost,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go into it with the same form we&rsquo;ve had previous to the Everton game.&rdquo;Chilwell, who has made his eight league appearances for Leicester, said Shakespeare&rsquo;s decision to rotate the squad was a factor in the Everton loss.&ldquo;It was great to get six wins before but &lsquo;Shakey&rsquo; (Shakespeare) rotated the squad. He gave a few players the chance and obviously rested a few of the players for the Champions League game,&rdquo; Chilwell said.&ldquo;Hopefully on Wednesday everyone will come back fit and fresh, and everyone that&rsquo;s involved, whether they start or come off the bench, will be ready to get the win.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Atletico have grown accustomed to slaying Europe&rsquo;s giants in the Champions League under Diego Simeone, but ending Leicester&rsquo;s run may prove even tougher than ousting Barcelona or Bayern Munich, according to defender Filipe Luis.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not favourites. We don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said the Brazilian left-back despite the vast gulf in Champions League experience between the sides.Atletico are in their fourth straight quarterfinal and missed out by narrow margins in two final defeats to cross-city rivals Real Madrid in the past three years.However, Atletico are all too aware of what Leicester are capable of after the Foxes booted their La Liga rivals Sevilla en route to the last eight in their first ever appearance in the competition.&ldquo;Maybe we are better against these teams, Barcelona and Real Madrid, because they have the ball and they control the game. When we have to initiate the style of play it&rsquo;s not so easy,&rdquo; added Filipe Luis, who kept Gareth Bale quiet as Atletico held Real to a 1-1 draw on Saturday.The return leg is set for 18 April.
