ARSENAL S season will end as a big disappointment if they fail to finish in the Premier League top four and secure Uefa Champions League qualification, goalkeeper Petr Cech has said.The North London side booked a spot in their third FA Cup final in four years after defeating Manchester City 2-1 at Wembley on Sunday.Cech, however, urged his Arsenal side to focus on the league where they trail the top four by seven points ahead of tonight s fixture against Leicester City at the Emirates. Our target is to finish as high as possible. If we don t qualify for the Champions League, it will be a big disappointment, Cech said. We re going to be under pressure in every game now because of the league position we are in there s no option but to win. The FA Cup is at the end of the season so there s a lot to happen before we play that game. The 34-year-old goalkeeper said Arsenal proved they do not lack leaders in their team by rallying from a goal down to beat Manchester City last weekend.He said: I think it s easy to hide behind oh they lack leaders but they have leaders . You need to see behind the scenes how well the team works and how we operate, he added. We had a difficult period where the team was losing . . . obviously you come to the situation where you play under pressure and need to find a way out. Liverpool will fight for a Premier League top four finish to secure Champions League action next season despite Sunday s 2-1 defeat to Crystal Palace, midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum has said. Palace came from a goal behind at Anfield to defeat Juergen Klopp s side, who remain third in the league standings with Manchester City and Manchester United two and three points behind, respectively but both with two games in hand. (As long as) there s a chance to qualify for the Champions League, we have to believe in it, Wijnaldum said. REUTERS
