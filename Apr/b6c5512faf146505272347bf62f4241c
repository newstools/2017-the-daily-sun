AJAX Cape Town are flirting with relegation danger, but their Dutch coach, Stanley Menzo, is not pressing the panic button just yet.&nbsp; Despite being five points above relegation zone, the Urban Warriors mentor has called for calm. The Mother City-based outfit are 10th on the log table with 26 points from 25 games. The Urban Warriors welcome Platinum Stars at the Cape Town Stadium today (3pm), in a game that Menzo described as a cup final. Menzo&rsquo;s charges cruised to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of defending league champions Mamelodi Sundowns at Loftus Versfeld midweek. Ajax defended well for 60minutes, but collapsed as the Brazilians unlocked their rigid defence.Menzo said: &ldquo;The biggest difference was the quality of Sundowns, they unlocked our defence. We almost did enough to get a point. I&rsquo;m confident this team won&rsquo;t go down, we have to get the three points against Stars. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big game. We can&rsquo;t afford any slip-ups today.&rdquo; Menzo said he had been involved in relegation battles twice in his coaching career in the Netherlands, and lived to tell the tale. Menzo said: &ldquo;I survived relegation twice and know what needs to be done to avoid the axe. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m telling my players there&rsquo;s no reason to panic, we just need to win to survive relegation. &ldquo;We hope to collect three points against Stars and the first 60 minutes against Sundowns is the positive I&rsquo;ll draw from our previous league game. &ldquo;We defended well and created a couple of chances on the counter-attack, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be working on at training,&rdquo; he said. Negotiations to extend the 53-year-old former Dutch international goalkeeper&rsquo;s contract are already under way, but he says he will entertain thoughts of penning down a new contract at the end of the season.Menzo said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking about the next season, but my top priority is to survive relegation. There won&rsquo;t be a next season for me if we don&rsquo;t avoid relegation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk about a new contract only if we survive the chop.&rdquo; Mark Mayambela and Thabo Mosadi&rsquo;s experience will come in handy for the Urban Warriors in their quest to retain their Premiership status.&nbsp;
