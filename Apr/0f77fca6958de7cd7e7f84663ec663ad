METRO cops and the Nelson Mandela Bay internal audit division on Friday confiscated laptops from three public health officials in connection with irregular payments. The law enforcement officials swooped into the homes of the suspects late at night and seized the laptops belonging to the municipality as part of a probe into irregular payments and invoices. Mayor Athol Trollip said: &ldquo;The municipality had identified a number of allegedly irregular payments and invoices in recent months, particularly at the public health directorate. This resulted in the suspension of a municipal employee late last week. &ldquo;City manager Johann Mettler then requested that the laptops, which are the property of the municipality, be retrieved.&rdquo;Trollip said the new government of Nelson Mandela Bay was committed to stopping corruption and fraud. &ldquo;All municipal officials, elected representatives and contracted service providers found guilty of fraudulent or corrupt activities will be charged and prosecuted. &ldquo;Any corruption identified will also be reported to the police. &ldquo;We are now moving into a new phase of investigations into serious allegations of corruption in various directorates.&rdquo;He said the media and public would be briefed tomorrow on the status of these investigations. Kristoff Adelbert, the mayor&rsquo;s chief of staff, said: &ldquo;For now, we can&rsquo;t reveal the value of the contract or the invoices that are being investigated because we don&rsquo;t want to jeopardise the investigation. &ldquo;The mayor will outline the specific details of who is being investigated for what, and how much is involved.&rdquo;
