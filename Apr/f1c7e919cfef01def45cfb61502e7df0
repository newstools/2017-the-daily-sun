HOUSE music maestro, DJ Merlon, is said to be avoiding Durban tycoon Calvin Mathibeli &ndash; all because of a debt.According to sources, the Koze Kuse hitmaker is running away from Calvin because he can&rsquo;t pay back money he borrowed.&ldquo;DJ Merlon&rdquo;, real name Sbusiso Mhlongo, is said to have asked for a R300&thinsp;000 loan to pay artists who performed during the Durban Music Festival, which was held at Eyadini Lounge, in Umlazi last year.Sources in the music fraternity told Sunday Sun all was not well between Calvin, who owns Calvin Family Group in Durban, since DJ Merlon failed to pay back his money.A source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Government froze everything after initially agreeing to fund Merlon&rsquo;s event.&ldquo;The event came and the money he was supposed to receive from government didn&rsquo;t come through.&ldquo;He had invited big artists and they were not paid on time. He then went to Calvin to ask him to fund him, so that he could pay service providers. Calvin helped, but now Merlon is battling to pay back the money.&rdquo;Another mole said: &ldquo;It may be more than R300&thinsp;00. Both of them are good people, but Merlon is taking advantage of Calvin. Merlon is now avoiding Calvin and doesn&rsquo;t go to places where he knows Merlon will be there.&rdquo;On Friday, DJ Merlon requested the SunTeam to send an email, but failed to respond by the time of going to press. Calvin could not be reached for comment and he&nbsp;also failed to respond to our SMSes.
