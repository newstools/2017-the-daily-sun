LOCAL cop Tembisa Ngcelwane is having a hard time figuring out how to catch a thief!This time around the thief is no usual suspect, but a strange wild cat!Villagers of St Mark&rsquo;s in Cofimvaba said they are sleeping with one eye open since the strange cat started feasting on their livestock.Last week, Tembisa lost three of his sheep after they were bitten by the wild cat. &ldquo;I found the dead animals outside my house with bite marks. You could see they had bled heavily,&rdquo; she said. Village headman Mbulelo Booi said he had heard of the creature, and he only confirmed its existence when it killed one of his sheep recently.&ldquo;I tried to chase it and threw rocks at it, but it was too fast. People have lost their livestock and now fear the cat might start attacking them,&rdquo; Mbulelo told Daily Sun. Tembisa&rsquo;s uncle Thandekile said he built a kraal and covered it with protective wire to keep the predator away.Raymond Mzilikazi of the SPCA in Queenstown said they received reports about the wild cat in Cofimvaba and Lady Frere. He said: &ldquo;The wild cat is a lynx and attacks domestic animals such as sheep and goats. It sucks their blood and leaves them dead. Sadly, it is also dangerous for human beings.&rdquo; Makhuze Nonzaba, assistant manager for the community services unit at Intsika Yethu Municipality, said they were not aware of the lynx attacks.If people come forward, we will work with the environmental affairs department to have the animal captured,&rdquo; Makhuze said.
