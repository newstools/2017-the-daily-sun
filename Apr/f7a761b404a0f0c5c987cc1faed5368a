Ajax Cape Town coach Stanley Menzo has expressed his concern over the team's frailties in defence as they look to avoid relegation from the Premiership.The Urban Warriors have endured a difficult season and find themselves uncomfortably close to the bottom two.A win on Wednesday against second-from-bottom Highlands Park will bring some relief for Menzo's side, but the Dutchman is worried about the problems at the back."It's the whole team's issue they haven't had a clean sheet in a long time," said the former Ajax Amsterdam goalkeeper."The moment you don't score, it puts a lot more pressure on your defence and goalkeeper. So, it is a concern, as and clean sheet means at least one point."Ajax will be hoping to arrest a seven-game winless run having last tasted victory back in December when they beat Chippa United 1-0 in Cape Town.
