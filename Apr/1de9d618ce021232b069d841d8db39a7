SOME nyaope smokers were chilling next to a road in Erasmus, north of Pretoria when they were spotted by police on patrol. The cop from Mabopane and a Tshwane Metro police officer stopped the van they were travelling in and searched the young men for drugs. Nothing was found on them, but the two officers did not leave them alone. They made the men do push-ups in full view of pedestrians and motorists. The smokers said it was an abuse of power. The cops gave them biscuits after they had done the exercises.One of the smokers, who identified himself only as Mrakes, told the People&rsquo;s Paper they felt humiliated by the action of the officers. &ldquo;They found nothing on us and instead of going to fight crime elsewhere, they wanted to show off and flex their muscles.&ldquo;Our arms and backs are still sore from all the exercise. We are always looking for items to sell so we can buy nyaope. Our bodies are too weak for the push-ups the cops made us do.&rdquo;Daily Sun spoke to the two officers. &ldquo;These young men lead an unhealthy lifestyle. We hope they will keep on exercising,&rdquo; the one cop said. Motorist Mokibelo Malema (35) said the officers are a good example to lazy cops. &ldquo;Other officers should learn from these two and support drug addicts. Instead of collecting bribes from motorists, officers should be visible and motivate vulnerable members of our community to reduce crime and substance abuse.&rdquo;
