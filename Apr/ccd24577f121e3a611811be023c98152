A MAN accused of being part of a group of six that allegedly killed a 39-year-old man and drank his blood wept when he was denied bail! He was appearing in the Rustenburg District Court.Napoleon Webster allegedly killed Sataba Chale in Marikana, North West in December. Chale was killed after a renewal, healing and reconciliation event at Wonderkop in Marikana.The number of accused has grown to 13 after more arrests were made last Monday. Last month, the five other accused were denied bail. A number of EFF supporters sang and danced outside court. The rest of Webster&rsquo;s supporters, who were in the courtroom, cried when he was denied bail.The investigating officer had to be escorted out after they threatened him. At the bail application, Webster denied being among the group of five other accused that allegedly hacked Chale, beat him to death and drank his blood.The court sat for the whole day as arguments were heard. Magistrate Andries van Wyk read the arguments and all the witnesses&rsquo; accounts. Webster argued that the court was being unfair for not allowing CCTV footage from the Marikana Shoprite store that allegedly shows that he was there when the crime took place.Captain Jack Sepeng earlier told the court he was on duty on the day of the murder. He said Webster was among the group of men who came to the police station carrying sticks and spears.He said the men who came to protest said no police should ever enter Marikana RDPs, or else they would be killed. The five other accused are Aubrey Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha, Mdlondozi Fundiwo, Herbert Baqhesi and William Nyenyane. The defence indicated that they would appeal the bail ruling. The case continues today.
