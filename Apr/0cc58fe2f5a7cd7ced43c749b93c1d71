&ldquo;PLEASE save me and my children from my abusive boyfriend!&rdquo; This is the cry of a 57-year-old woman from Orlando West in Soweto, who said she has had enough of years of abuse. She told Daily Sun she feared her 52-year-old boyfriend would eventually kill her. &ldquo;I do piece jobs to make sure the family is fed, but he forcibly takes the little money I have and uses it to buy alcohol.&ldquo;He has stabbed me in the past and even poured boiling water over me while I was sleeping. &ldquo;I have opened four cases against him, but he is released every time and beats me even more. &ldquo;The abuse has become so bad that my 15-year-old son is living in the bush. I have sent him blankets and food because he refuses to come home.&rdquo;Her son told the SunTeam: &ldquo;He beats us all, especially me. He calls me worthless and says I was a waste of sperm. &ldquo;What kind of a father says such things to his own son?&rdquo;The boy&rsquo;s father was hostile when the SunTeam approached him. He said: &ldquo;Who the hell do you think you are to tell me what to do? This is a family matter. You should mind your own business if you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo; Captain Philemon Korombi, a police spokesman, said a case of domestic violence was opened. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out why he has not been arrested yet.&rdquo; He said the case was withdrawn in court. &ldquo;We are still waiting for the docket to find out why the matter was withdrawn.&ldquo;The victim must speak to the station commander.&rdquo; Mbangwa Xaba, social development spokesman, promised to refer the family to a social worker.
