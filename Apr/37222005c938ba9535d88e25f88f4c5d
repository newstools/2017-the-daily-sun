A flight jacket or bomber jacket is a casual jacket originally created for military pilots. A bomber jacket on a guy can take a simple outfit and turn it into a very stylish outfit.&nbsp; Bomber jackets come in different colours and prints but the shape of the jacket remains the same.&nbsp; As we are heading into the colder months, look into investing in a bomber jacket for the "Cool Boy" look.
