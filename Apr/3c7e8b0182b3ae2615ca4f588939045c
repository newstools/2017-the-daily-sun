HE WAS abusive to his girlfriend and as Easter approached, Sixolile Tamoyi started thinking about how Jesus died for everyone&rsquo;s sins. So the day before Good Friday, he hanged himself in his shack in Primrose, Ekurhuleni, to pay penance.His sister Khuthala said he left a note apologising to his girlfriend for the abuse. &ldquo;I was at home when I heard my brother was found hanging in his shack. When I arrived at the scene, his body was still hanging there and neighbours were gathered around him,&rdquo; she said. Khuthala said after the police had taken the body, the family and neighbours were shocked to find the letter he had written. &ldquo;Neighbours said Sixolile had told them he would die before Good Friday because he didn&rsquo;t want God to punish him after his death. &ldquo;He wanted to die and there was nothing anyone could do to stop him.&rdquo; Khuthala said none of her relatives is employed and they didn&rsquo;t know how they would take the body back home to the Eastern Cape for burial. Sixohile&rsquo;s girlfriend, Amahle Masheki, said she had an argument with him four days before he died. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect him to kill himself. I am shocked our fight led to him committing suicide.&rdquo; Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said an inquest docket was opened.
