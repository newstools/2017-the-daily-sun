FOR the past five years Nora Shabalala (64) has been living in fear.She alleges that every month, her 23-year-old stepdaughter beats her and takes her pension grant money to buy nyaope.The unruly young woman has even kicked the gogo out of her own house in section D4 of Mamelodi West, Tshwane.Nora now lives in a shack in the backyard but last week she decided enough was enough, and refused to let go of her money.This apparently angered her stepdaughter so much, she choked the gogo until she collapsed, and ran away with the money. Nora said her neighbours poured buckets of water on her to wake her up. She is still in bed, nursing a painful neck. She regrets the day she brought the girl into her life. &ldquo;After I divorced her father, I continued to care for her. Instead of thanking me, she has been abusing me verbally and physically for money she wants for her drugs. I want nothing to do with her any more.&rdquo;Neighbour Sibongile Sekhwela said: &ldquo;We want to teach the addict a lesson before handing her over to the police.&rdquo; Mamelodi West police spokesman, Captain Michael Maheso, said the gogo should open a case against her stepdaughter.
