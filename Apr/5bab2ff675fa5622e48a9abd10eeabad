EMOTIONS ran high in Muledane Village outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo yesterday. This was after the mutilated body of Kenneth Mkhari was found at a local soccer field. The 32-year-old man&rsquo;s body was found with several stab wounds.His ears, nose and lips were missing. Residents believe the murder was a ritual killing. Kenneth&rsquo;s sister Joyce Mkhari told Daily Sun her brother left home on Saturday afternoon to watch soccer. &ldquo;He never came back. The next day we saw a trail of blood not far from our home and reported the matter to the police. They did not take us seriously. I was shocked when I later got a call telling me my brother had been found dead.&rdquo;The community took to the street to vent their frustration. They blockaded Thohoyandou and Makhado roads and accused cops of not doing anything about ritual killings in the area.Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, Limpopo police spokesman, said the cops&rsquo; preliminary investigations revealed Kenneth might have been killed somewhere else and dragged to the scene.&ldquo;The motive behind the killing is still unknown but a ritual related murder may not be ruled out. No arrests have been made.&rdquo; Anyone with information is asked to contact Colonel William Ramokhubedu at 082 499 8389 or their nearest cop shop.
