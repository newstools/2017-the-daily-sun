SANGOMA Ramatsa Mathatsie (32) claims his doll head has supernatural powers to heal.The man from Phase 3, Mangaung says the doll he calls Nkgono was a gift from his ancestors.He claims the doll head in front of his indumba might look simple but it has the power to read customers&rsquo; problems as they enter his consultation room.According to Ramatsa, people from his kasi believe the doll is used for witchcraft, but he says it was innocent and meant to do good. Ramatsa has been a sangoma for three years and wants his neighbours to respect his doll head.He says: &ldquo;My doll protects me and gives me strength to heal people who are sick and terrorised by tokoloshes. &ldquo;I got the doll after my initiation in 2014. I was told by my ancestors in a dream to fetch it and they directed me to an open field outside my kasi. &ldquo;I have been working with it ever since. My ancestors instructed me to put Nkgono in front of my indumba.&rdquo;The sangoma says: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t put muthi on it as it represents the head of my ancestors. &ldquo;I kneel down and pray before it so I can communicate better with my ancestors.&rdquo;
