FITCH Ratings downgraded South Africa to non-investment grade today.It is the second rating agency to downgrade South Africa to junk status, meaning certain international investors will have to pull their investment from South Africa.This is because investors have rules about where they can invest their clients&rsquo; money. It takes two rating agencies to make a country officially junk status for these rules to kick in.Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s (S&amp;P) downgraded South Africa to BB+ (junk status) on Monday evening, following President Jacob Zuma's reshuffle last Thursday, which saw the removal of Pravin Gordhan as finance minister.While S&amp;P's outlook was negative, Fitch had kept the outlook at stable. The other rating agency - Moody's - has South Africa two notches above junk status but put the nation's sovereign rating on downgrade review this week.&ldquo;In Fitch's view, the cabinet reshuffle, which involved the replacement of the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, and the deputy finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, is likely to result in a change in the direction of economic policy," it said in a statement today.&ldquo;The reshuffle partly reflected efforts by the out-going finance minister to improve the governance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The reshuffle is likely to undermine, if not reverse, progress in SOE governance, raising the risk that SOE debt could migrate onto the government's balance sheet.&ldquo;Differences over the country's expensive nuclear programme preceded the dismissal of a previous finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, in December 2015 and in Fitch's view may have also contributed to the decision for the recent reshuffle. Under the new cabinet, including a new energy minister, the programme is likely to move relatively quickly.&ldquo;The state-owned electricity company, Eskom, has already issued a request for information for nuclear suppliers and is expected to issue a request for proposals for nuclear power stations later this year. The treasury under its previous leadership had said that Eskom could not absorb the nuclear programme with its current approved guarantees, so the treasury will likely have to substantially increase guarantees to Eskom.&rdquo;This would increase the amount of debt the government has, mainly linked to SOEs like SABC, SAA, Eskom and Prasa.Fitch&rsquo;s added that the Cabinet reshuffle would probably result in Zuma choosing to spend more money in the name of "radical socioeconomic transformation".&nbsp;&ldquo;The tensions within the ANC will mean that political energy will be absorbed by efforts to maintain party unity and fend off leadership challenges and to placate rising social pressures for addressing inequality, poverty and weak public service delivery. The Treasury's ability to withstand departmental demands for increased spending may also weaken,&rdquo; it said.The ratings agency also said that political uncertainty was a main cause of last year&rsquo;s weak growth.&nbsp;http://www.fin24.com/Economy/breaking-fitch-downgrades-sa-to-junk-status-20170407&nbsp;
