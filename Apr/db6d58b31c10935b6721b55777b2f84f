Apart from the suspended Tamsanqa Teyise, it should be the same players who do battle for a second successive week when Free State Stars face Orlando Pirates&nbsp;in a Nedbank Cup last 16 match.The game at the James Motlatsi Stadium is scheduled to kick off at 8.15pm on Saturday evening.It will be the second time in a week that the two teams meet at the same venue, Ea Lla Koto having beaten the Sea Robbers 3-2 in a league encounter last Saturday.Bucs attacking midfielder Thembinkosi Lorch concedes his team are in for a major challenge, but has promised the club's supporters that he is determined to give them reason to smile by helping to book Pirates' place in the quarter-finals."Stars are a good team and it's very hard to play against them, especially at their home ground," Lorch was quoted by&nbsp;Goal."They are very aggressive. We have to use our strength to win the game and work on our defensive patterns to avoid conceding soft goals.&nbsp;"If the team is not doing well, I'm not happy," the 23-year-old continued. "When we win, I can enjoy my personal achievements. Supporters look to me to deliver, so I will put in more effort to help turn our fortunes around," he said.Free State Stars will go into the game with an extra spring in their step having beaten the Soweto giants last weekend.Unfortunately for them though, central defender Tamsanqa Teyise is suspended.The home side are also without long-term injury victims Thokozani Sekotlong and Nyiko Tshabangu, while captain Paulus Masehe is doubtful.
