MINAH Masango (38) says she is a natural caregiver and likes helping people. She had big plans when she bought a stand in block X, So-shanguve, north of Pretoria last month.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy this stand for myself. I want other people to benefit from it.&ldquo;I want to open a care centre. The problem is that I don&rsquo;t have any money to buy building material. I&rsquo;m asking for any form of donation so that I can start the project.&ldquo;Once the care centre is up and running it will be a great help to parents who get home late from work. I will take care of their children while they&rsquo;re away from home.&ldquo;I will accept cement, bricks, tiles and cash donations.&rdquo; Minah wants to run orphanages too &ndash; and not just in Soshanguve.Call her on 078 508 7903 if you can help.
