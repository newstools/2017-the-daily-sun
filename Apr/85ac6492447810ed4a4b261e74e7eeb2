SHE&rsquo;S gorgeous, talented and soulful!&nbsp;That&rsquo;s debut recording artist Ma Nala (22). And she&rsquo;s setting herself a high target. The young singer aims to represent Mzansi overseas and make an international name for herself while she&rsquo;s at it!&nbsp;Born at Bisho in the Eastern Cape, this lovely songbird enjoys making music that strikes a chord in the emotional lives of her listeners.&nbsp;And that statement is amply supported by her debut single, Tryna Find Love. This jazzy-yet-soulful track tells a story &ndash; of a journey to find the indescribable love the singer yearns for.&ldquo;Soul and jazz have always come naturally to me. It always surprises people that I&rsquo;m so young and have a love for it,&rdquo; said the singer who studied music in California, US.&nbsp;She is proud of her Xhosa roots, and the name Ma Nala is her family&rsquo;s clan name. Ma Nala, whose real name is Aphelele Mnyango, dropped her marketing management studies after a year to do music full-time.&nbsp;&ldquo;I went to visit my brother, who at the time stayed in Los Angeles, California, to pursue his music journey.&nbsp;&ldquo;That visit reignited my love for music and the desire to pursue it professionally,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;She is the younger sister to the renowned musician, songwriter and producer, Anatii.&nbsp;The rising singer says her love for music comes from their late father.&nbsp;She added: &ldquo;My dad loved and listened to a wide range of music when we were growing up.&nbsp;&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s also why the genre I perform feels so comfortable to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;In 2014, Ma Nala jetted off to the US to pursue music, which she described as a bold move for a 19-year-old.&nbsp;&ldquo;Being in a foreign country chasing my dream taught me how to be myself and gave me a new kind of confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp;She also performed at clubs and concert venues during her stay in the US. She told SunBuzz she was getting excited about her upcoming music video shoot for the debut single, Tryna Find Love, and said she wanted to add a few creative elements that would stand out.&nbsp;She told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be a typical music video about two people in love having a picnic.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for something that will be more visually dynamic, and I know my brother, who&rsquo;s a great director, will help me achieve that.&rdquo;&nbsp;
