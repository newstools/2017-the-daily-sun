AFTER he heard that Khayalethu Tobela (47) had died on Sunday, his suspected killer tried to flee KZN. But his plan didn&rsquo;t work and the cops caught him in a taxi to Gauteng. The suspect (37) was arrested yesterday in a taxi on its way from Ladysmith to Gauteng. It&rsquo;s believed the gun used to shoot Tobela, who was the Umzimkhulu municipal speaker, was in his possession. The family of Tobela, who died in hospital over the weekend after being gunned down at his home in Emfundweni on Thursday, expressed happiness at the arrest. Tobela&rsquo;s brother Sibongiseni (50) told Daily Sun he and his family were hopeful the suspect would tell the truth in court. &ldquo;If he did it on his own he must tell the court why. If he was hired he must say who wanted my brother dead so that person can also face the law,&rdquo; he said. He was happy that his brother&rsquo;s blood had &ldquo;spoken, even before he was buried&rdquo;.&ldquo;When we received news of his death we felt helpless because we had hoped he would recover and tell the cops who had shot him. As he was being shot we heard him shout that he knew who his attackers were.&rdquo;Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed the arrest. &ldquo;A 37-year-old suspect appeared in the Ladysmith Magistrates Court yesterday for possession of an unlicensed firearm. He will be transferred to Ibisi cop shop where he will face a murder charge,&rdquo; she said.
