NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has agreed to requests for yet another motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma.The DA, EFF and the UDM all wrote to the speaker following the recent Cabinet reshuffle, which resulted in finance minister Pravin Gordhan losing his job.Parliament will debate the motion at 2pm on Tuesday, 18 April.Political parties are expected to lobby ruling party MPs to "vote with their conscience".This was agreed to after a consultation process with leader of government business Cyril Ramaphosa.&nbsp; The political parties each called for an urgent sitting of the National Assembly to be reconvened to debate the motion, as Parliament is currently on recess.This will be the fifth time that opposition parties are attempting to get rid of Zuma in this manner.The last motion of no confidence against Zuma, tabled in November 2016, failed when 216 voted against it and 126 MPs voted in its favour.On Sunday, Mbete said she would make a decision on the motion after meeting with the leader of government business and ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu.On Monday, opposition parties dared ANC MPs not to follow the party line in voting against Zuma.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/motion-of-no-confidence-in-zuma-to-come-before-parliament-soon-20170405&nbsp;
