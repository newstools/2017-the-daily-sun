SOME residents thought their traditional leaders were wrong to negotiate with government about the Vuwani municipal demarcation. They said the signing of a memorandum of understanding was an act of desperation and a campaigning tool for last year&rsquo;s election.The agreement has not shown any results and the Municipal Demarcation Board last week rejected the submission by traditional leaders.After receiving the response, the leaders pulled out of any further talks with government.Yesterday, at a media conference at the Vuwani Science Centre in Vuwani called by the Pro-Makhado task team, spokesman Nsovo Sambo said Vuwani residents felt sad, undermined and deprived of their rights.&ldquo;Government exposes itself to be self-serving,&rdquo; said Sambo.&ldquo;The Municipal Demarcation Board&rsquo;s rejection of the call of the people to determine Vuwani&rsquo;s boundaries is based on arrogance and stubbornness.&rdquo;The Vhembe Pastors Forum, which worked tirelessly to restore order in the area, attended the meeting.It was decided the community should meet at the Nandoni Sports Ground, where the way forward will be discussed.&ldquo;The rejection exposes the lack of political leadership within the government due to factionalism in the ruling party.&ldquo;The people of Vuwani became the scapegoats,&rdquo; said Sambo.
