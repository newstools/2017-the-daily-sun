GOLDEN Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen says he is looking to improve his team's away form as battle for top eight heats up. Tonight Abafana Bes'thende take on Polokwane City in an Absa Premiership clash at Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane (7.30pm).&nbsp; Larsen's run on the road has been poor this season having won just three in 12 matches. He also drew three and lost six in those matches.&nbsp; Tonight Larsen seeks a different performance from his players and also looking to consolidate the top eight spot.&nbsp; Said Larsen:"There's a lot to play for against Polokwane. We want to maintaining our top eight spot. But the most important thing is to improve our away record that has been poor. We will have to go there and compete for every ball and make sure we come away with something." Last time these two met in Durban last November Rise and Shine walked away with a point after the game ended in a 3-3 draw. Larsen is aware of the danger pose by City and he is going there wary of them.&nbsp; He added:"Polokwane are one of dangerous teams in the league. They have Rodney Ramagalela and ever green Jabulani Maluleke who make the team tick. In fact the whole team has quality players. But like I said we are going there to compete and make sure that we consolidate our top eight position." The two are going to this match with the same number of points (31) and they are only separated by goal difference. Rise and Shine are in sixth and Abafana Bes'thende in seventh position.&nbsp; Arrows will be looking to take their Cup competition form to the league. They will be facing City fresh from beating Platinum Stars in the quarterfinal of Nedbank Cup on Saturday.&nbsp; But their last league match they drew 1-1 at home against struggling Ajax Cape Town. City meanwhile last played Wednesday last week when they beat Dikwena 1-0 at the same venue they host Arrows tonight.&nbsp;
