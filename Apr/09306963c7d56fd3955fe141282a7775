RESIDENTS have been harassed by stock thieves since 2015. So when a business selling cattle opened in Ndilini, near Ixopo in the KZN Midlands, everyone suspected it wasn&rsquo;t above board. A resident said they asked the Hawks to investigate. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a high rate of stock theft in this area. In most cases our cows are stolen at night,&rdquo; he said.Hawks spokesman Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo confirmed receiving a tip-off about people suspiciously selling cattle. He said the SAPS stock theft unit went to the place where the business was run. &ldquo;We found 19 cows suspected of being stolen. The cows are valued at about R100 000 and were taken to the pound for safety.&rdquo;Mhlongo said four suspects were arrested last Thursday. &ldquo;They appeared in the Hlanganani Magistrates Court on Monday. They were kept in custody.&rdquo; He urged everyone around Ixopo who had lost cattle to come forward.
