RUNNERS and their families had a bright day of fun at the Capitec Colour Run yesterday.The event, hosted at the University of Joburg&rsquo;s Soweto campus, saw runners of all ages take part in the 5km race.Families came in big numbers to enjoy the day. &nbsp;Tickets were sold at R270 each, and R10 from every ticket sold was donated to certain schools around Soweto.Craig McLennan, who co-ordinated the event, said: &ldquo;The purpose of the run is to promote health, happiness, individuality and giving back within the community.It was the second time the event was hosted in Soweto, and the turnout was amazing. People enjoyed themselves and let loose.&nbsp;The runners ran through the streets and sprinkled onlookers with colourful powder. A cop was caught off guard and got colour sprinkled on his uniform.After the run was over, participants gathered at the stadium and jumped up and down to music as more powder was thrown into the air.At the end of the day, everyone went home filled in colorful dust which showed that the event was a success.&nbsp;Ran the happiest 5km in the world yesterday! I feel ready for a new week &amp; new challenges. #motivationmonday ___________________________________ #colorrun #capiteccolorrun @colorrunposts #livebetter #healthyliving #lifestyle #run #running #healty #instafun #instagood #5km #5kmdone #mondaymotivation #life #active #activelife #soweto #africa #igers #photooftheday #happy #happiest5kA post shared by Thando Aya Dlalisa (@thandoafrica) on Apr 24, 2017 at 2:43am PDT#KeKwaBaRe Feeling myself @theorlandotowers #curvygirl #curvelove @thecolorrunsa for the #capiteccolorrun2017 #biggirl staying fit???? #5k??
