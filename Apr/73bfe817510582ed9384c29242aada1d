TAXI boss William Nhlabathi (53) and his wife woke up choking, their eyes stinging, while thick smoke made it difficult to breathe. They realised that not only was their bedroom on fire, but that the entire house was about to be engulfed in flames. William and his family from Sun City Village, near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga, are lucky to live to tell the tale. The incident happened last Monday.William and his wife first got their kids to safety and then managed to fight the flames.In the end only their Toyota Corolla RSI that was standing outside in the yard was completely burnt.&ldquo;We battled the flames at the entrance to the bedroom for what seemed like an eternity.&rdquo;William said when they finally managed to bring the fire under control, he realised his vehicle had also caught fire.&ldquo;My car was badly burnt. Only its shell remained,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am grateful that my neighbours came to assist, or the damage would have been greater.&rdquo;William said he didn&rsquo;t know the reason he was attacked. He said he couldn&rsquo;t be certain, but thought it might be taxi-related. Sergeant Zimkhona Mahlangu said a case of malicious damage to property was opened. She said police were still investigating the motive behind the attack.
