FORMER Muvhango star, Joe Ragwala&rsquo;s troubles are far from over. The star, who used to play Ntshavheni Mukwevho on the popular SABC2 soapie, was granted R1&thinsp;000 bail after spending almost two weeks behind bars. Sunday Sun reported that the faded actor was arrested for contravening a protection order at his girlfriend&rsquo;s family house in Tzaneen, Limpopo. Joe will soon be appearing at the Sibasa Regional Court on fraud, intimidation and theft charges from 15 to 19 May. And in July, Joe will find himself back in the Giyani Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on conspiracy to commit murder charges. Inject Paramedic College owner, Goddard Mugwena, opened a case against the former actor and his girlfriend Doris Mthembi. Goddard is Doris&rsquo;s ex-husband. A fuming Goddard said the two defrauded his college of more than a million rand and are facing 172 counts of fraud. Goddard told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Doris built a mansion in Tzaneen and also extended Joe&rsquo;s house in Mangilasi Village, near Thohoyandou. &ldquo;Doris was my wife then, but started cheating with Joe. She lied to me and said one of the Muvhango actors had registered as a student at my college. I didn&rsquo;t suspect anything, but things unveiled themselves when Joe started sending intimidating text messages to me. The police and a private investigator discovered the sender of the intimidating messages was Joe and arrested him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They hired Moses Ntsenene and Vincent Phakula to kill me. This attempt failed and the two armed hitmen were arrested at the scene.&rdquo; Ntsenene and Phakula have already been sentenced to six years in prison each since December 2014. Joe was not available for comment.&nbsp;
