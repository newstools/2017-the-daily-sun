POLOKWANE City goalkeeper Herold Ndlovu&rsquo;s hunger for knowledge has always been his saving grace.Once confronted by the reality of an abusive stepdad, one of Mzansi&rsquo;s hardest working footies sought refuge in his books and pursued his soccer dream with a vengeance. Finally reaping the fruits of his labour, the 25-year-old from Lulekani in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, said his bright future would&rsquo;ve faded had he not persisted. &ldquo;My stepdad wanted to kill my dreams and ambitions, and would&rsquo;ve succeeded had I let him have his way,&rdquo; Herold said. &ldquo;I remember how he forcefully took me back home when I was out playing soccer.&rdquo; Herold recalled how happy he was the day his mum finally separated from the man who&rsquo;d made his life a living hell. &ldquo;I last spoke to him in 2012, and have no regrets about that. I never enjoyed my youth because of him. In fact, my mum deserves far better in life. Hence, I&rsquo;m building her a house in Phalaborwa.&rdquo; The goalie also remembered how his mum saved him from his stepdad&rsquo;s abuse. Said Herold: &ldquo;She took me to Mokopane Academy to study there &ndash; to get me away from him. &ldquo;When I passed Grade 10, I returned home to Lulekani. But the environment was, as usual, polluted by that man&rsquo;s hate. &ldquo;I then asked my mum to stay with a relative in Giyani. It was a very hard decision for her, but she let me go.&rdquo; Herold added that he then enrolled for a logistics management degree at the Vaal University of Technology after matriculating at Hinkhensile High School in 2010. &ldquo;There, I joined the varsity football team, but was never recognised. I then dropped out after four months and went back home to play for Novela Stars FC, which was then in the Vodacom League in the 2011/12 season,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In 2012, I enrolled at the University of Limpopo for a degree in information studies, and continued playing for Novela during weekends. When my contract expired, I joined Winnerspark FC in the 2013/14 season before the team released us during its restructuring.&rdquo; And in 2014, Herold&rsquo;s fortunes changed when he was recruited by Polokwane City coach Nkueni Mayala. &ldquo;I trained with the team without a contract, and later decided to focus on my studies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In 2014, I was called again to train with the side&rsquo;s MultiChoice team, and later signed a contract with the senior team in July 2015. &ldquo;I love education, hence I completed my information studies degree last year before our match with Chippa United. &ldquo;I want to be educated like Orlando Pirates striker Lehlohonolo Majoro because there&rsquo;s life after football.&rdquo; The footie encouraged up-and-coming soccer stars to take education seriously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to find yourself in a situation where there&rsquo;s no bread on the table when you retire,&rdquo; Herold cautioned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m planning to register for my LLB with Unisa in July.&rdquo; Efforts to get comment from his stepfather were unsuccessful.
