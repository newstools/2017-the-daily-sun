MOURNERS gathered at Slahla Stadium in Richmond, in the KZN Midlands on Saturday to bid farewell to deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa. Phoswa (39) was found dead at her house in Ndaleni last Sunday with a bullet wound to her head. It is not clear whether she shot herself or was killed, but police are investigating a case of murder.Nomusa Dube-Ncube, KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, and provincial education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwane paid tribute to Phoswa.Dlungwane said he was fed up with the service offered by the Richmond Police Station. &ldquo;That police station needs new cops who will do their jobs properly. &ldquo;Criminals can&rsquo;t keep roaming the streets while we keep losing members,&rdquo; said Dlungwane.Municipal speaker Samora Ndlovu said the municipality has lost a hard worker.&ldquo;I spoke to Thandazile hours before her death. &ldquo;We were planning to attend a meeting the following day. &ldquo;She was looking forward to developing Richmond. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that residents don&rsquo;t feel safe anymore because cops are sleeping.&ldquo;We need the cops to put those who are responsible for this crime behind bars,&rsquo; said Ndlovu.Ntombiyelanga Baraza, Phoswa&rsquo;s sister, couldn&rsquo;t hold back her tears as she stared at her sister&rsquo;s coffin.&ldquo;My sister wasn&rsquo;t a coward. &ldquo;She was not afraid to face the challenges life threw at her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she took her life, and I pray that God reveals the truth.&rdquo; Thandazile&rsquo;s son, Siboniso Phoswa (16), said his family has lost their pillar of strength, as his mum was very supportive and loving.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the house will be without her presence. &ldquo;I have lost a friend who was always there for me. &ldquo;I pray that God will heal our wounds.&rdquo;
