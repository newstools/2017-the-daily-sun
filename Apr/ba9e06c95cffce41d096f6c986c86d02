KHETHOKWAKHE MASUKU has vowed to face his problems head-on at Bloemfontein Celtic, instead of running away.SunSport has been told Masuku has been involved in an ongoing salary dispute at Siwelele.This seems to have affected his performance, as he has struggled to break into the starting line-up or even warm the bench.But the dribbling wizard revealed he would continue working hard in a bid to convince new coach, Luc Eymael, to give him a chance.Said Masuku: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still around Bloemfontein. Football has its ups and downs. Yes, I need money to support my family. It&rsquo;s not all about the money, but happiness. Whatever the challenge I&rsquo;m facing, I need to keep my head up because if I look down, I will fall.&rdquo;The winger revealed that Phunya Sele Sele fans were also surprised about his lack of game time.&ldquo;The fans are surprised why I&rsquo;m not playing. They love me and ask why I&rsquo;m not given a chance. They want to know what&rsquo;s happening. I can&rsquo;t give them a reason because the technical staff knows why,&rdquo; Masuku said.&ldquo;I know competition is stiff, and the coach decides who he wants to play. If I do my best, maybe he will consider me in the team. He&rsquo;s new and I understand he&rsquo;s still trying to find different winning combinations. &rdquo;Masuku made it clear that he wouldn&rsquo;t change his style of play to win a place in the team.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t change the way I play. The people who pay to watch me and other players such as Mark Mayambela enjoy what we do,&rdquo; he said.The 31-year-old emphasised he wouldn&rsquo;t quit due to pressure.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame anyone for the situation I&rsquo;m in. I&rsquo;ll overcome this hurdle, instead of running away.&rdquo;
