WITH less than six weeks remaining before the Under-20 World Cup kicks off in South Korea, Amajita coach, Thabo Senong, is hoping PSL teams will co-operate and release players on time.Senong will announce his 26-man squad tomorrow, which will later be trimmed to 21 players, who will represent Mzansi in the world showpiece from 20 May to 11 June. Amajita will have two camps before their trip to Asia. Senong hopes all players will report for camp on 17 April. He said: &ldquo;The problem with Amajita is players don&rsquo;t report on time and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons which leads to failure. &ldquo;As coaches, we don&rsquo;t get enough time to prepare the boys. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m positive I&rsquo;ll get all of them on time because the MultiChoice Diski Challenge is over, also considering this is a world showpiece. &ldquo;We will need to make our mark as we don&rsquo;t usually participate on this stage.&rdquo; Amajita have been pitted in Group D against Japan, Italy and 2013 runners-up Uruguay. They will face Japan in their tournament opener on 21 May at the Suwon World Cup Stadium, before they play Italy three days later and close off the group stage against Uruguay on 27 May. This will be the third Under-20 World Cup appearance for Amajita. Their last appearance was in 2009 in Egypt, where they were knocked out in the Group stages after winning one match, drew one and lost the other game. Senong revealed that defence is one of the areas that still needs tightening. Amajita&rsquo;s defence was leaky during the Youth Afcon in Zambia as they conceded nine goals. &ldquo;We are not that bad in defence, it&rsquo;s just that players need more time together, and in the Afcon some of them joined us in the last minutes, that&rsquo;s why we ended up conceding a lot of goals,&rdquo; Senong said. &ldquo;But we will put some work to ensure we do well in the World Cup.&rdquo;
