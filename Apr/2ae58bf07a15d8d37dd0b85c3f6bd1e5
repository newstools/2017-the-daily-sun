THEY say lightning does not strike in the same place twice!In a Gauteng man&rsquo;s case, however, that saying proved untrue. The lucky man won PowerBall two times in one draw! He accidentally bought himself two winning tickets &ndash; and walked away with R15,2 million!The winner, who cannot be named, said he had been playing for many years using the same numbers. He said: &ldquo;I have been playing for years without fail and I always played specific numbers as I believed that some day the numbers would come through. On Friday morning on my way to work I bought my ticket. However, when I woke up on Saturday I forgot that I had already played and went and bought another ticket.&rdquo; On 24 March the PowerBall jackpot was R30,6 million and there were four winning tickets each worth R7,6 million. The lucky Joburg-based engineer held two of the four.
