TEACHERS from Ndlumbini Junior Secondary in Khwanyana, Port St Johns are worried about their pupils. The kids are forced to use the bushes to relieve themselves because the toilets at the school are old. The teachers also fear the building might collapse at any moment.Cebisa Mpongo, a teacher, said: &ldquo;I think these classrooms were built more than 35 years ago.&ldquo;I fear my classroom will collapse while we are in it. &ldquo;But since we don&rsquo;t have anywhere else to go, we are forced to stay here.&ldquo;We are struggling and the situation is affecting the kids.&ldquo;When it rains we tell them not to come to school because we are concerned about their safety.&ldquo;We cannot put their lives at risk.&rdquo; Principal Mlamli Lubelu said: &ldquo;The classrooms are old and leak whenever it rains.&rdquo;He said they would be grateful if the department of education renovated the school so the kids could have proper toilets. &ldquo;We are behind compared to other schools in the area.&ldquo;Our school is very poor.&rdquo; Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said a new financial year was approaching and they intended to deal with issues like these soon.Mtima said: &ldquo;We will put this school on our radar so we can deal with their problems. &ldquo;The department wants to ensure that pupils study in an environment that is fit for teaching and learning.&rdquo;
