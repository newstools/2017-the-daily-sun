THABISO Mahase is crazy about the soapie King of Hearts!He&rsquo;s so mad about it that he doesn&rsquo;t mind watching it at a friend&rsquo;s house not far from his house. Last Wednesday night the 30-year-old was glued to the screen as he watched his favourite actress Roshni get her life back. What he was not aware of was that at the same time, his life was falling apart! Thabiso, from Simunye near Westonaria, west of Joburg said he smelled smoke outside but thought nothing of it. &ldquo;What I didn&rsquo;t know was that it was my RDP, engulfed in fire,&rdquo; he said.Minutes later Thabiso joined his neighbours who were already hard at it, trying to extinguish the blaze. &ldquo;I suspect vutha because all my belongings were burnt but those of the person who used to rent here were not. &ldquo;Maybe there is someone after me, but I will pray for answers.&rdquo;Thabiso said he didn&rsquo;t have electricity as the box was taken out by the municipality due to outstanding arrears owed by his late father.&ldquo;There was no lit candle because I use my phone as a torch.&rdquo; Now Thabiso is staying at his friend&rsquo;s house. Rand West City municipal spokesman Gugulami Ngcobo told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Our caring municipality has an indigent policy to assist people like him who are unemployed. The municipality can assist by scrapping the amount owed, but he still has to buy water and electricity. After a year the contract can be reviewed,&rdquo; said Ngcobo. He added that the municipality was not aware of the fire. Randfontein police spokeswoman Captain Appel Ernst said they wouldn&rsquo;t have opened a case because there was no criminal element. &ldquo;A case is only opened if there is suspicion of arson,&rdquo; she said.
