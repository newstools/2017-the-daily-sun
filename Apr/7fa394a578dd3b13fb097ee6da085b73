Full of hope and excitement as we progress."But I have to say what a great performance from Leicester, it was almost a pleasure to compete against then. We were living in fear all night of what they might achieve. They pushed us all the way."He added: "We performed in the way this match needed us to perform. We always come up with a solution. I don't like to praise too much but we responded and played in the we needed to."Atletico have been beaten finalists in two of the last three years, but Simeone says that just means they are on the right track.He added: "It is great to be in the semi-finals for the third time in four years.

It is satisfying now to say we are a competitive outfit."
