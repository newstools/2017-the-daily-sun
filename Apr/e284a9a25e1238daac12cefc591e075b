AWARD-WINNING producer and club DJ Prince Kaybee is accused of stealing a song.&nbsp;Up-and-coming Sharpeville rapper Samuel Mokhele claims the Free State-born DJ stole his song Wajellwa, which won him many awards.&ldquo;Prince Kaybee stole my concept and even had the nerve to admit that publicly when I confronted him on Twitter,&rdquo; Samuel said.Kaybee demanded that Samuel prove that the song belonged to him.&ldquo;As long as he can provide proof, then I&rsquo;ll comment. Till then, I won&rsquo;t comment on the issue. I made the song two years prior to its release,&rdquo; said Kaybee.Samuel, aka &ldquo;JustSam&rdquo;, said he tried to engage Kaybee, but the DJ ignored him.&ldquo;I play around a lot with music. I did a track using one of the international beats and released the song in 2013.&ldquo;In 2014, I met Cassper Nyovest at the Castle Lite music tour in a bid to do a remix, only to find that he knew my track and was interested to be featured on it,&rdquo; said JustSam.JustSam said Cassper was supposed to be on the remix of the track, which also featured DJ X Angel, who helped him build his brand at the time.&ldquo;We had to remake the song on the new beat as the first one had an international beat. I was shocked to learn Kaybee had a track titled Wajellwa.&ldquo;I asked Kaybee on Twitter how he came up with the concept of the song. But he lost it and told me I was mad &ndash; he made the track blow up and I had failed to do so. &ldquo;I was defeated and wanted to forget about music,&rdquo; he said.When told JustSam was a hip hop artist, Kaybee said as a house producer, he&rsquo;s not inspired by a hip hop song.Cassper was not available for comment.
