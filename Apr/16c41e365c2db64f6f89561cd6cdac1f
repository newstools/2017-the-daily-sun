The ANC are holding a press conference regarding the notes about its NWC meeting that were 'erroneously' sent to the media last night.&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;COSATU FINALLY CALLS FOR MSHOLOZI'S HEADWATCH LIVE HERE:&nbsp;Here is what people have to say:&nbsp;Malema did say that Gwede Mantashe will speak against the #cabinetreshuffle then say the opposite when the ANC holds a presser ?? #ANCNWC&mdash; Karabo Mokgoko (@Karabo_Mokgoko) April 5, 2017We were fools for thinking the ANC can be salvaged. It is dead, no turning back now. They've chosen Zuma over the people of SA. #ANCNWC&mdash; Hlumelo Dwesini (@Hlummy_D) April 5, 2017#ANCNWC In other words. President Jacob Zuma is not going anywhere.&mdash; Bonga Dlulane (@BongaDlulane) April 5, 2017I cannot believe what is happening in front of my eyes. This is why our parents in Nelson Mandela Bay are done with these guys. #ANCNWC&mdash; Sibongile Mafu (@sboshmafu) April 5, 2017Summary of #ANCNWC statement. Gwede, Cyril &amp; Zweli: We were wrong. Sorry. Jacob Zuma: I was wrong. Sorry. All: NOW LET'S MOVE ON! @News24&mdash; Adriaan Basson (@AdriaanBasson) April 5, 2017#ANCNWC presser... Let me summarize Mantashes long speech for you guys. " you guys can scream all u want. Zuma is not going anywhere "&mdash; Namudi Makola (@NamudiMakola) April 5, 2017#ANCNWC basically told SA #ANC is no longer party for the people. I look forward to day that these #ANCMPs join unemployment line with me&mdash; South African Heroes (@SA_Heroes) April 5, 2017The takeaway from this #ANCNWC briefing is clear: Zuma has whipped his opponents within the ANC into line. He's got no plans to go anywhere.&mdash; Simon Allison (@simonallison) April 5, 2017Gwede Mantashe at the #ancpresser pic.twitter.com/sCYSjbwGtQ&mdash; dirty lungz (@cannan1000) April 5, 2017#ANCpresser #ANCNWC #NWCPresser #JunkStatus Congrats ANC!
