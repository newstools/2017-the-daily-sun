MARITZBURG United interim coach Fadlu Davids played mum when asked whether he was ready to take up the coaching job at the club on a permanent basis. Davids, who is assisted by his brother Maahier, was on the bench on Saturday when United won their third home game of the season, beating Ajax Cape Town 2-1. The Davids brothers seem to know which buttons to push to make players dance to their tune. Even though the players are responding well to Fadlu&rsquo;s tactics, the former striker was reluctant to reveal his plans when asked if he would consider taking the job permanently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just happy that the team won. We will keep fighting,&rdquo; said Davids. His good work with the team has pleased his boss, Farook Kadodia, who was all smiles after his side collected maximum points for the second time in 2017. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put pressure on Fadlu. He says he&rsquo;s not ready for the job and I respect that. The only thing I can do is give him support and manage him well. He&rsquo;s still doing his coaching licences and I&rsquo;m fully behind him on that,&rdquo; he said. The Ajax win took Maritzburg back into the top eight with 26 points. Goals from Andrea Fellicia and Denis Onyongo made sure United ended Saturday in eighth position in the table. Substitute Aubrey Funga pulled one back for struggling Ajax.
