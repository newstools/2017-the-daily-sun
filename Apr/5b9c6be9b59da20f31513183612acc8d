THE TRAFFIC jam at the top of the Absa Premiership table is getting more and more intense with each game!A gap of only two points separates the team at the top of the standings &ndash; Cape Town City &ndash; and fourth placed Mamelodi Sundowns.The Citizens lead the pack with 46 points from 24 matches followed by second-placed Bidvest Wits and third-placed Kaizer Chiefs on 45 points, and Mamelodi Sundowns hot on their heels in fourth place with 44.What makes the race for the championship even more interesting and tight this season is the fact that log leaders City and third-placed Chiefs have both played 24 matches, while Wits and Sundowns have played 22 each. This makes it tough for Wits and Downs&rsquo; opponents &ndash; although matches in hand do not always translate into points.This is also the case at the bottom of the table, where there is a scramble for survival. Four points separate 16th (Baroka FC with 21 points) and 11th place (Platinum Stars, with 25 points from 23 matches).A few weeks ago Sundowns looked to be out of the title race. However, fast forward to this week and the defending PSL champions have milked six points from SuperSport United in the space of six days, leaving Stuart Baxter&rsquo;s lads kicking their heels in fifth place with 37 points.Downs embarrassed SuperSport 5-0 last week and confirmed their dominance over their neighbours on Wednesday with a 1-0 defeat at Lucas Moripe Stadium.In fact, Sundowns have collected nine points over six days if their 1-0 win against Free State Stars on Sunday is included.Adding another dimension to this season&rsquo;s race for glory is the fact that some of the top four still have to play against each other.The&nbsp;Citizens&nbsp;meet Chiefs on 25 April, while Wits have a date with Sundowns on May Day and with&nbsp;Amakhosi&nbsp;in their last fixture for 2016-17 on 27 May.Downs&nbsp;coach Pitso Mosimane must have breathed a sigh of relief when Hlompho Kekana&rsquo;s powerful header beat SuperSport&rsquo;s Ronwen Williams midweek to earn them three points.This prompted SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter to confess that&nbsp;Matsatsantsa a Pitori&nbsp;are now out of the running for the league title.And the slump seems over for Mosimane&rsquo;s charges: &ldquo;Now the slump has to go to other clubs. We are peaking at the right time, we have the right qualities and character to make a final push for the title.&rdquo;Baxter, who was grumpy after losing yet another Tshwane derby, said the momentum had swung back in Sundowns&rsquo; favour.He said: &ldquo;There are many ways to win the championship and we were well in the race, but I think we are on the fringes now.&ldquo;Sundowns have been handed a massive boost with the two wins against us. They are in good shape and now favourites to win the title.&rdquo;Mathematically&nbsp;Matsatsantsa&nbsp;still have an outside chance of claiming the title. But they have tricky matches against Wits and Chiefs still ahead.
