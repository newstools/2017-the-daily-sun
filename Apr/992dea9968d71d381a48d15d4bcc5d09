DEPUTY General Secretary of SACP, Solly Mapaila was booed during Chris Hani&rsquo;s wreath laying ceremony.But Mapaila said it didn&rsquo;t come as a surprise as he was expecting something like that to happen.On Friday&nbsp;Mapaila was one of the political leaders who were leading the march for Zuma to stepdown in Tshwane.When asked about the booing incident, Mapaila said: &ldquo;We were aware that people had organised to boo us in this event, and we told our comrades that there should never be a reprisal to do that.&rdquo;He said that they condemn the booing in strongest possible terms.&ldquo;We want the discipline to the party carders to be exemplary going forward.&ldquo;We should not join hooligans and hoodlums who seek to hijack this kind of platform.&rdquo;When the booing started, ANC Ekurhuleni Chairman Mzwandile Masina intervened and jumped to the podium told their unruly member to stop booing.The same scene was seen in KZN when KZN ANC chairman Sihle Zikalala also jumped to the podium and pleaded with the ANCLY members stop disrupting speeches at Ahmed Kathrada&rsquo;s memorial service&nbsp;on Sunday.Masina told the media that the rowdy ANC members that was booing and singing was not from his region.&ldquo;We noted that there were some very few elements not from this region who were misbehaving.&ldquo;We want to condemn that incident in the strongest possible manner because comrade Chris Hani was a unifier and we can never use such occasions to display our differences the organisation.&rdquo;He concluded by saying the matter will be dealt with internally.
