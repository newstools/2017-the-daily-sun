STUN grenades, rubber bullets and teargas were fired by the cops during a protest against land invasion. This came after residents of south extension in Lenasia, Joburg took to the streets yesterday to protest against the illegal occupation of land in the area. Scores of protesters gathered at the K43 intersection demanding that the land be taken back from illegal occupants. Community leader Gugu Manana said the government had ignored complaints about squatters living on open land in the area. &ldquo;We are not happy with how the issue is being addressed. We demolished shacks people had erected but then we were accused of being Guptas. &ldquo;Who are these people who have been given the right to just invade the land? &ldquo;Who gave them this power? It&rsquo;s an insult to those of us paying bonds when somebody just comes and takes the land for free.&rdquo; Gugu said they would not allow the road to be opened until municipal officials discussed the issue with residents. &ldquo;No one is going to come here and devalue the houses we&rsquo;re working hard to pay off. We don&rsquo;t care if this is politically influenced. Let the politicians give the invaders their own houses.&rdquo; Joburg Community Safety MMC Michael Sun said the city is trying to end the tension between residents and invaders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s believed the invaders come from as far away as Orange Farm, Ennerdale and Fine Town.&rdquo; JMPD spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar advised motorists to avoid the area. &ldquo;The situation is very tense. &ldquo;It is not safe to go there as residents and government officials are currently in talks.&rdquo;
