THE former Baroka FC coaching duo of Jacob Sakala and Edward Williams have been found guilty of insubordination and subsequently shown the door, Kick-Off reported yesterday.The two appeared before the club&rsquo;s disciplinary committee (DC) after being placed on immediate suspension without pay in February for refusing to sign a document mandating them to win their next four league games.Sakala had been the head coach while Williams worked as his assistant. Their brief spell at the club lasted two games &ndash; an away defeat to Chippa United and a home draw with Platinum Stars.&ldquo;The verdict, which led to the parting of ways based on the charges laid against them, has now been sent to the two but as is the procedure it is up to them to appeal, which should be done within 14 days,&rdquo; said club boss Khurishi Mphahlele. &ldquo;They had been charged with insubordination.&rdquo;The third member of that disbanded technical team, Mark Harrison, is yet to appear before the DC.The nomadic trainer, who had been hired as a technical advisor, apparently refused to sign the attendance register for his DC, labelling the sitting unprofessional and unconstitutional.He is, however, still in possession of a club vehicle and the matter is considered pending by the Limpopo-based outfit.Harrison was appointed in January just days before Sakala and Williams arrived at Baroka.Long-serving club employee Kgoloko Thobejane has since been joined by Milton Dlamini in a co-coaching setup that the club hopes will rescue the team from the axe.
