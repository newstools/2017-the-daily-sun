Fish traders in Cleary Park Shopping Centre, Port Elizabeth are causing a big stink at the back of the mall.Residents claimed the dumped rotten pieces of fish and bones in refuse bins leave an unbearable stink. The main culprit according to residents is the refuse truck which collects rubbish from the mall. People said this truck stinks and parks for long periods of time at the back of the mall.Mlungwana Nontshinga (52), of Missionvale kasi in Port Elizabeth, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Cleary Park Shopping Centre is in a convenient area because Sassa and Home Affairs are there. &ldquo;But going to the taxi rank is torture because you have to pass through the stink of rotten fish.&ldquo;This stinking truck parks regularly between the taxi rank and a chicken restaurant. I used to enjoy eating at that restaurant before the bad fish smell. But lately, I buy take-aways and go on my way.&ldquo;I understand that fish is affordable and in demand. However traders should take responsibility for the smell it produces by putting any rotten fish and bones into refuse bags and tying them up tightly. This would reduce the terrible smell. I love this place but the smell is unbearable.&rdquo;The truck driver said: &ldquo;It is the fish traders who are causing the problems. We only collect their rubbish.&ldquo;We cannot be blamed because we are just cleaning the mall.&rdquo; The SunTeam tried to speak to the fish traders but all of them refused to comment.Sibongile Dimbaza, spokesman for mayor Athol Trollip, said: &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t acceptable. The metro has recently launched a legal dumping campaign. &ldquo;We encourage fish traders to use plastic bags, tie them tightly and put those plastic bags into refuse bins. &ldquo;We will follow up on this matter.&rdquo;
