Orlando Pirates striker Tendai Ndoro insists his main focus is firmly on helping the team rather than chasing the Golden Boot.Having started the season on a high note and setting the pace as the early contender for the Premiership's top goalscorer award, the 31-year-old saw his form take a dip for a while.With his 12th league goal having come in the form of a penalty in the 3-2 defeat to Free State Stars two weeks back, Ndoro had last found the back of the net with a brace in the 2-2 draw with Highlands Park on December 3."Well, it's true that I have not been finding the back of the net for a while, but I'm not concerned by that because I have been creating [scoring opportunities] for my team-mates to score in recent games," the Zimbabwe international told&nbsp;Vodacom Soccer."Yes I'm a current league's top scorer and it's every striker's wish to finish the season as a top goalscorer. But that doesn't mean one has to be selfish and go for personal glory by not creating for fellow team-mates to score."My focus is currently on helping the team fight for maximum points in the remaining league games and also doing well in the Nedbank Cup, rather than bothering myself on chasing for Golden Boot."The 28-year-old has been instrumental in some of the Buccaneers' goal-scoring opportunities in two consecutive victories over Ea Lla Koto and Maritzburg United."Every striker goes through a dry spell at some stage, but I'm happy that I have been contributing to the team's goals in recent games," he added."I can feel now that I'm gradually regaining my scoring form, and goals will come without putting myself under unnecessary pressure."The league's leading scorer is only one goal ahead of in-form Cape Town City attacking midfielder Lebogang Manyama who has 11 goals.
