STEPHANIE Sandows (26) tackles issues like transactional sex in MTV&rsquo;s Shuga.She plays Tsholo in the award-winning drama. &ldquo;She is a 15-year-old teenager being raised by her father, a truck driver,&rdquo; said Stephanie.&ldquo;She is in a relationship with a blesser who gives her things in return for sex. He picks her up from school and also buys her food.&rdquo;Stephanie said Tsholo does it to feed the family. She is in charge of the household, as her father is never at home. Stephanie said her role on Shuga is based on reality. &ldquo;But Tsholo ends up a total mess. The show reflects our lives. Many teenagers are in trouble and we need to highlight the problem through shows like these.&rdquo;Stephanie, from Eldorado Park in Joburg, said this is her first leading role. Her first part was that of receptionist Ingrid in Scandal!, who she still plays.&ldquo;Scandal! was my training ground. I got there knowing nothing and learnt a lot.&ldquo;It took me three years of auditions until I got Tsholo&rsquo;s role. I had six call backs before I got it. &ldquo;Your breakthrough always comes just as you are about to give up.&rdquo;She said she was suddenly on a different level in Shuga and just had to cope. &ldquo;It strengthened me. Now I&rsquo;m where I belong.&rdquo;When she was 14, Stephanie was a presenter for Bonisanani on SABC1 and when she turned 20, she presented Sistahood.The young actress, a linguistics graduate from UJ, said her biggest challenge in Shuga was speaking Setswana but with the help of her colleagues she is coping well.She also is a casting director on Scandal!. &ldquo;I help to choose new characters through auditions,&rdquo; she said. Stephanie also helps out at different upliftment programmes in her neighbourhood. &ldquo;I teach young people that where you come from does not determine who you are,&rdquo; said the actress.
