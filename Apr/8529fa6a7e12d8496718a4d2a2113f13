THE KZN Health Department has been forced to close a clinic in the north of Durban at night after a robbery on Saturday night. Thugs held a guard at gunpoint at Qadi Clinic in Inanda at 1am and forced him into the guardhouse. According to a nurse, they took his cellphone and money and fled. &ldquo;Two hours later they returned, demanding we let them in because one was injured.&rdquo; The nurse said when they refused, the thugs threw stones and tried to open the gate. Health Department head Sifiso Mtshali slammed attacks on health facilities. &ldquo;Thugs have begun attacking clinics, emergency vehicles and healthcare workers.The Qadi incident leaves the department with no choice but to suspend the clinic&rsquo;s 24-hour service. The MEC was forced to suspend service at another clinic to protect workers after they were attacked by criminals.&rdquo; Mtshali said from now on, Qadi Clinic will stay open until 6pm. &ldquo;All emergencies, including birth deliveries, which would have gone to Qadi after 6pm will be transferred to neighbouring health facilities.&rdquo; Resident Sihle Zondi (35) said they were unhappy there was no service at night. Captain Gabi Simelane confirmed that thugs stole a cellphone and money belonging to a security guard at Qadi Clinic. She said the case has not been registered yet as the victim has to provide more details.
