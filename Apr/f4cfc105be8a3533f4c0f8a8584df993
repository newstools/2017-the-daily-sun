IN a clash that was mostly the SuperSport Rugby Challenge pick of the afternoon, the Border Bulldogs and Boland Cavaliers thrilled the over 2000 enthusiastic fans that packed the Wolfson Stadium here yesterday.There were enough tries to see the Bulldogs bark their way home with a 28-25 victory, a result that satisfied the supporters who packed the stadium.And when Cassper Nyovest showed up to perform his hit song &ldquo;Mama I made it&rdquo; then even the players at the half time break could be seen dancing and singing along to the tune, as if they have made it to the top of their game.Kids from the small towns of KwaNobuhle and KwaZakhele forgot that they had come to watch a rugby match and circled around the music maestro to sing along and touch him.But when reality struck home then the Bulldogs and Cavaliers went into the second half with the latter leading 20-14 after three tries to one. But the Bulldogs barked their way back with three more tries and conversions from Michael Makase&rsquo;s brace and Blake Kyd to push their side to a 28-20 lead in the 65th minute.The Bulldogs relied heavily on big gigantic man, Siyamthanda Ngade, whom fans chanted &ldquo; beeeeast&rdquo; every time when he was in possession and blocked the Cavaliers players from passing through their 22m line.A minute later Cavaliers&rsquo; Charles Mayeza was left frustrated when his try was not allowed by match referee Cwengile Jadezweni, as he seem to have lost control of the ball before jumping over the try-line. &nbsp;Earlier in the day, Port Elizabeth&rsquo;s Harlequins beat African Bombers 45-34 in the Gold Cup qualifier where a number of tries were scored by both teams to kick off the exciting day of rugby.&nbsp;In other SuperSport Rugby Challenge results on Saturday: Griquas beat Sharks 28-7 while Valke went wild 50-33 against Welwitschias, Leopards defeated Griffons 29-17 and Blue Bulls won 23-31 against Pumas.&nbsp;SunSport is official media partners to the SuperSport Rugby Challenge
