BLOEMFONTEIN Celtic&rsquo;s first team will miss this morning&rsquo;s funeral of the club&rsquo;s lifetime president, Rantlai Petrus &ldquo;Whitehead&rdquo; Molemela, whose service will be held at the Dr Petrus Molemela Stadium.The struggling Siwelele players will be gearing up for tomorrow&rsquo;s Absa Premiership catch-up match against Mamelodi Sundowns at Tshwane&rsquo;s Lucas Moripe Stadium (7.30pm).Celtic chief executive Khumbulani Konco confirmed yesterday that the players would not be able to attend the funeral due to the league match.Explained Konco: &ldquo;Only the players not in the team to play against Sundowns will attend the funeral. Even the coaches (Lehlohonolo Seema and Luc Eymael) won&rsquo;t be available.&rdquo;Pressure is mounting on Celtic. They dodge bullets on a daily basis. Despite the funeral, new coach Eymael, will appear before the PSL disciplinary committee on Thursday in his fight with his former club, Polokwane City.City want Eymael to return to Limpopo and lodged a case with the PSL after the 57-year-old Belgian left them in the lurch to sign with Celtic.City filed a case against him to nullify his contract, which could see the coach having to pay a certain amount to be released from his contract by Johnny Mogaladi&rsquo;s club. There was also high drama at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday when Rise and Shine officials and Celtic players exchanged words after the home side refused Eymael entry into the change-room. Celtic defender Wandisile Letlabika was seen on television getting up close and personal with an unidentified City official as Siwelele players attempted to get Eymael entry to the change-room.SunSport&rsquo;s source, who was nearby when the scuffle occurred, said: &ldquo;The funny part is that Eymael was allowed to enter to the change-room before kick-off. What will have changed between then and half-time?&rdquo;Tomorrow&rsquo;s clash will be Sundowns&rsquo; first appearance since their 2-1 loss to Kaizer Chiefs at the weekend, which saw Bangaly Soumahoro score an own goal that ended up being Amakhosi&rsquo;s winning goal.
