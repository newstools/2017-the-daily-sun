THE SACP believes there was a gunman at the Chris Hani commemoration on Monday who threatened the first deputy general secretary of the party, Solly Mapaila.Hani was the general secretary of the SACP when he was assassinated 0n 10 April 1993.&ldquo;They wanted to repeat what they did with comrade Chris Hani, with Comrade Solly," said SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo.The party has referenced a News24 video to support their claims.In the video, a man in the marquee can be seen holding what the party believes is a gun. He is among a crowd of people that booed Mapaila when he took to the stage at the Thomas Nkobi cemetery, where Hani is buried.Standing a few metres from the podium, the man is seen handling the item and then putting it down while Mapaila was trying to address the crowd.Mapaila was not able to deliver his commemorative message as a thunderstorm broke out.Police told News24 that they were not aware of the incident.Mapaila has led calls by the ANC tripartite partners for President Jacob Zuma to step down following his decision to reshuffle his Cabinet, firing five ministers, including finance minister Pravin Gordhan, without consulting the partners.The SACP says those threatening Mapaila must know that he is not acting as an individual, but carrying out the mandate of the party collective.It has also blamed the alleged incident on the factional battles plaguing the ANC.&ldquo;These thugs wanted to commit 10 April the second time on the graveside of Comrade Chris Hani. They are shameless and rotten to the bone marrow in pursuit of the factionalism that is destroying our liberation movement and now wreaking crisis through corruption, corporate capture and spying on comrades," Mashilo said.The SACP condemned the incident, and said it would take action, legally and politically.Mapaila was first booed when his name was called out for him to go lay a wreath on Hani&rsquo;s grave on behalf of the SACP.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sacp-claims-there-was-a-gunman-at-hani-memorial-20170412
