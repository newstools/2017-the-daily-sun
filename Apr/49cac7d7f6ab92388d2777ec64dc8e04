A GROUP of amathwasana and their gobela went to seek ancestral blessings.But they ended up with one of them dead and four injured!It happened when their bakkie overturned on Heidelberg Road near Carnival City, Ekurhuleni on Saturday afternoon.Now the amathwasana from Wattville, Ekurhuleni claim their ancestors have turned against them. Other sangomas believe the gobela should be blamed for the crash, as he didn&rsquo;t follow instructions from the ancestors. Sangoma Xoliswa Jele said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous not to follow the ancestors&rsquo; instructions. We don&rsquo;t know what the gobela did, but the crash could have been avoided if he had listened to the ancestors&rsquo; orders.&rdquo; Sangoma Veli Mtshali said: &ldquo;The gobela must fix the things the ancestors don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; But gobela Thapelo Lekgau (29), who was travelling in another car, said: &ldquo;This could have happened to anyone. I don&rsquo;t want to blame myself or anyone else.&rdquo; The dead thwasana was Thapelo&rsquo;s cousin, Trevor Skosana (23). A case of culpable homicide has been opened.
