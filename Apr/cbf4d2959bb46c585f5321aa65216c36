WE all make mistakes. But you don&rsquo;t want your hair to be one of them. So stop doing the following: 1. Intense towel drying According to Shampoo Truth, rubbing your hair with a towel can rough-up the outer layer of the hair and worsen split ends. Solution: Don&rsquo;t rub &ndash; blot! With a clean, soft towel. If it feels rough against your skin, it will be rough on your hair. 2. Over-washing your hair&nbsp; Try not to wash your hair every day since this strips it of essential, protective oils. Every two or three days is enough. 3. Using hot irons on damp hair&nbsp; Hair should always be completely dry before heat styling. Wet hair and hot tools don&rsquo;t mix. Using hot iron on wet hair results in it forming into a mass of small, tight curls. 4. Wet brushing&nbsp; Your mum probably told you this, and guess what, she was right. Your hair becomes weak and fragile when it&rsquo;s wet, therefore, it is definitely advisable NOT to brush your hair in its damp state. Solution: Brush your hair before you step into the shower. That way it will comb out a lot easier afterwards. Then, use a wide-tooth brush and gently press the water out of it or blot with a towel. You should always allow your hair to dry at least 80% before you even pick up that hair dryer.&nbsp;
