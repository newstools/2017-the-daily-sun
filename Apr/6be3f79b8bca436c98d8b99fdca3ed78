STUART Baxter has dismissed claims that he has concluded negotiations with the SA Football Association (Safa) to become new Bafana Bafana coach.The powers-that-be at his PSL club, SuperSport United, are watching from the sidelines as Baxter negotiates a lucrative deal with Safa, rumoured to include bringing on board his own technical team.Baxter told SunSport: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to involve myself too much in this issue but reports about everything being done and dusted a long time ago are absolutely not true.&rdquo;It has been reported Baxter will accept the Bafana job on condition that his son Lee becomes his goalkeeper coach and that fitness trainer Joshua Smith comes on board too. Not true, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made recommendations to Safa and they took them &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve never mentioned staff by name. The rumours are about 5% truth and 95% interesting story.&rdquo;Should Baxter be named as Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba&rsquo;s replacement, it won&rsquo;t be the first time he takes over the hot seat. He was first introduced to South Africa as Bafana coach in 2004 but didn&rsquo;t last long in his first stint. Between 2004 and 2005 he won 10 of his 23 games in charge and lost nine, with four matches ending in draws. Now, just over 11 years after he left the Bafana job, Baxter is the favourite to return to the hot seat, having gained several years of experience and a better understanding of South African football. When asked why he was interested in taking the job again, he said: &ldquo;The thing that interests me is that we are talking about a different job to the one I had back then. We are now talking about development, rebuilding and patience. &ldquo;For now my main focus is on SuperSport United and making sure I have a season to remember with them.&rdquo;
