HE IS only seven years old, but Shaunwin Cona packs a mighty punch.Shaunwin from Greenfields in Uitenhage practises the Ryushin-Kan karate style. Godfrey Cona (42), the boy&rsquo;s father, said his son took up the sport when he was four years old. Godfrey said: &ldquo;He used to split his legs just like the movie stars. &ldquo;The demonstrations he used to do at home were fascinating and he later pleaded with me to take him to karate school.&rdquo; In just three years, Shaunwin has toured the country and competed in a number of tournaments. His hard work has also earned him a number of medals. Zanthus Lungisa, the boy&rsquo;s instructor, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Shaunwin is a disciplined pupil and we value his vast contribution to the sport. &ldquo;He always shows respect by bowing to the elders. &ldquo;This year, he won a silver medal at a Ryushin-Kan karate tournament in Cape Town. &ldquo;Last year, he won a silver medal and a bronze medal at a championship in Bloemfontein.&rdquo; Lungisa said the boy was one of his best pupils. &ldquo;He is a very healthy child who can do not only 50 pushups, and he is also good at doing stomach exercises,&rdquo; he said. Shaunwin can split both his legs flat on the floor and he is also a great kicker! &ldquo;Karate is a good sport for people of all ages,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, it is especially beneficial to people who start practising at a young age. &ldquo;The sport helps you to gain confidence and discipline. It also helps you stay fit and live longer.&rsquo;&rsquo;
