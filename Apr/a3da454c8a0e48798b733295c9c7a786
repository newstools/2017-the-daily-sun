KEDIBONE Mothoa is tired of being discriminated against because she is in a wheelchair. The 59-year-old woman from Boekenhout in Mabopane, north of Tshwane said life in a wheelchair is hard. She said it is even worse when people living with disabilities do not get assistance to go about their lives. Kedibone, who currently lives alone, fell and broke her leg in 2008 and was told she would not be able to walk again. &ldquo;I had to use a wheelchair permanently but never anticipated the discrimination.&ldquo;Ever since I lost my ability to walk, things have been difficult. I spent months stuck in bed because I couldn&rsquo;t afford a wheelchair until my neighbour was kind enough to lend me hers.&rdquo; She said she thought once she had a wheelchair things would be easier.&ldquo;Little did I know things would be as hard. Recently I tried to get to a paypoint to get my disability grant in Soshanguve.&ldquo;I woke up early to beat the queue. &ldquo;I went to catch a taxi but I had to wait from 7am until 11am while taxis just drove past me. &ldquo;I eventually decided to call my sister to fetch me. &ldquo;This is an everyday experience when I try to travel by taxi. It is so frustrating.&rdquo;Kedibone said if a taxi does eventually stop for her, she is forced to pay extra because she is told other passengers are put out by her wheelchair. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking because even the grant money is not enough. It means my grant money all goes towards taxi fares,&rdquo; said sad Kedibone. Community leader Joseph Mashaba condemned what was happening to Kedibone.&ldquo;She must go to her local taxi association and tell them about her problem.&ldquo;I am sure they will be able to help her.&rdquo;
