A ROW has erupted over the election of a new mayor in the Abaqulusi Municipality in northern KZN.It&rsquo;s alleged the IFP councillors disagree about the proposed appointment of Mncedisi Maphisa (27) as mayor. The IFP leads the municipality, in coalition with the DA and EFF. The election follows Martin Mtshali&rsquo;s resignation in February.He resigned after he was suspended by the IFP in January following a fraud investigation by the KZN department of education. &ldquo;The meeting to elect Maphisa was on Thursday, but some IFP councillors disrupted it. They feel Maphisa is too young and won&rsquo;t be able to negotiate with investors to get money for the municipality,&rdquo; said a source.IFP national chairman Blessed Gwala confirmed the dispute. Zwakele Mncwango, DA spokesman, said the IFP must sort out its internal issues.Vukani Ndlovu, EFF spokesman, said it will be unfortunate if the municipality ends up without a mayor.Attempts by Daily Sun to get comment from Maphisa were unsuccessful as his phone rang unanswered. He did not respond to SMSes.
