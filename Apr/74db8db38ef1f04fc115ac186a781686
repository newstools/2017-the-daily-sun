NAL&rsquo;IBALI will celebrate World Book Day in style.The campaign which promotes reading will give away books to 20 000 children on Sunday.Valued at R250 000, the books will be donated to the campaign&rsquo;s literacy development partners.The donation aims to celebrate the work of its partners by acknowledging the joy and value of reading.Since 2012, the campaign has been providing free access to quality stories through its websites.The campaign is now calling on ordinary South Africans to donate new or used books that are still in a good condition.Jade Jacobsohn, managing director of the campaign, said: &ldquo;The most inspiring part about promoting reading in South Africa is that many parents, caregivers and community-based organisations are already reading and telling stories to their children.&ldquo;Through this generous donation from the campaign, we will give away books to 20 000 children on World Book Day. &ldquo;With the help of our partner G Murray Trust, we are able to donate the books.&ldquo;Special events with more than 100 partners will also be taking place this month.&ldquo;Members of the public who would like to support the drive are invited to attend special readaloud afternoons.&ldquo;The campaign will host events with local authors and renowned storytellers on 21 April. &ldquo;These readaloud sessions will offer parents and children an opportunity to experience the fun of an Nal&rsquo;ibali reading club, which is designed to get children hooked on books.&rdquo;
