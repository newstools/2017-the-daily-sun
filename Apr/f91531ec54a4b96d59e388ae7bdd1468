HUMAN Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has warned the ANC it could lose the 2019 election if the party doesn&rsquo;t change its ways. Sisulu said the current leadership of the party might live to regret their time in power. City Press reported yesterday that Sisulu told the party&rsquo;s leaders they had no right to hand over a disfigured ANC to the next generation. Her remarks were reportedly made at an event to rename a party branch in Keiskammahoek, Eastern Cape. Sisulu is said to be eyeing the top job when President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s term as ANC leader ends. Sisulu said those marching against the ANC and Zuma couldn&rsquo;t just be dismissed. The minister also confirmed she had received information that her life was under threat. Meanwhile, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe over the weekend also said the party would lose the next election if it showed the middle finger to the masses. He was speaking to party members at Matlosana Auditorium in North West. Speaking at the Siyabakhumbula Heroes event at the University of Zululand in KwaDlangezwa, KZN on Saturday, Zuma lashed out at his critics. He said during the days of apartheid, those who spoke badly of the ANC were given to him to deal with. He also claimed outside forces were trying to divide South Africa.
