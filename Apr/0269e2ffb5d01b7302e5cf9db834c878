THE advert inviting the public to apply for jobs at the Mpumalanga Department of Health is a big scam!The advert asks people to pay R800 for accommodation during an induction process. The man calling himself Mnisi, who is listed on the advert for inquiries, is not an employee of the department.Gillion Mashego, the Mpumalanga Health MEC, said the fraudulent job scam surfaced on the internet earlier this month, complete with department and hospital logos. &ldquo;The scam artist claimed there were vacant posts at Lydenburg Hospital, and that interested people should deposit R800 into a certain bank account,&rdquo; said the concerned health MEC. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already received inquiries on the bogus advertisement. The Mpumalanga Department of Health uses well-known print media, government facilities and radio stations to advertise vacant posts. &ldquo;There are strictly no fees that must be paid to get employment. We&rsquo;ve alerted our law enforcement agencies to get to the bottom of this act of criminality. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re calling on communities with information to report this evil act to the police. &ldquo;The department would like to put it on record that no posts have been advertised at the moment in Lydenburg Hospital.&rdquo;He said the perpetrators post information using the logos of the department with the intention to scam unsuspected victims.They promise people jobs in the hospital or the department. Mashego urged people to be vigilant and report such adverts to the police.
