HE IS handsome, dresses smartly and women like him. But Komana Raboshakga is still a virgin and says he&rsquo;s saving himself for his wedding night! The 32-year-old from Bochum, Limpopo told Daily Sun he had been in two relationships but never had sex with his girlfriends. He said one of the women even left him because he wouldn&rsquo;t sleep with her. &ldquo;When I had a girlfriend for a year in 2009, I made sure we met in public places like the park so we wouldn&rsquo;t be tempted. &ldquo;The longest relationship I had lasted for a year but we separated when the girl&rsquo;s family moved to Joburg.&ldquo;I had planned to marry her. &ldquo;The other girl I was with couldn&rsquo;t take being sexually starved any longer. But I couldn&rsquo;t do it so I let her go.&rdquo; Komana said he is ready to get married but could only commit to a woman who was born again. He encouraged young people to abstain from sex as it would keep them strong so they could satisfy their wives&rsquo; sexual desires when the time came. &ldquo;Abstinence is possible. Remain a virgin until you&rsquo;re ready to be married. &ldquo;I believe in abstinence, especially if one is not married, because sex is sacred and special. &ldquo;My wife will have a special night to remember on our honeymoon.&rdquo;
