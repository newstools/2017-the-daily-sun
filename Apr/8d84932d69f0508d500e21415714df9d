ONE of the Nkandla disciplinary hearings was postponed on Monday because Sibusiso Chonco didn&rsquo;t arrive. Chonco, a public works employee, is one of 12 officials accused of acting unlawfully by playing a role in the R246 million upgrade of President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s Nkandla homestead. Adrian Moodley, Chonco&rsquo;s lawyer, said a doctor has booked his client off sick from 29 March to 29 April. Requesting a postponement, he told chairman Thulani Khuzwayo that Chonco was on a lot of medication. Clement Kulati, the lawyer representing the public works department, said someone from Chonco&rsquo;s family should have applied for leave of absence. Kulati added that Chonco had been suffering from depression since 2000. Chonco had said he would not attend the hearing on Monday or Tuesday. Khuzwayo granted the postponement. The disciplinary hearing is set to resume on 4 July. &ndash; NEWS24
