NEW Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has spoken out against police killings. &ldquo;Anyone who kills a policeman will see fire meet fire. No police officer will die in vain,&rdquo; he said. Mbalula was speaking to cops in Tshwane yesterday for the first time since his appointment as police minister during last week&rsquo;s controversial Cabinet reshuffle. He said if criminals come with AK-47s, police must have something more deadly. &ldquo;You are not given those guns as toys. You must use them,&rdquo; he told cops.He pleaded with members of the public not to criticise cops who are heavy-handed towards criminals. &ldquo;We are not going to be soft with criminals,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We must put them in their place once and for all.&rdquo;Mbalula vowed to keep a close watch on corrupt police officers. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want policemen who are on the payroll of criminals. &ldquo;Police officers who are working with criminals must be identified by communities. &ldquo;We must work with honest and dedicated policewomen and men.&rdquo; Deputy minister of police, Bongani Mkongi told acting commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane to look into the salaries of cops to see why they were on the payroll of criminals. Speaking about the increase in organised crime, Mbalula said those who bomb cash-in-transit vehicles must watch out. &ldquo;They must know, wherever they are, that they can run but they cannot hide.&ldquo;We will find them. Even those who killed Senzo Meyiwa, we are coming for them.&rdquo; He said that while people have the right to protest, they should not destroy government property.
