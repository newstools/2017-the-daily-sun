LAST week, Perpecia Mphiliseng won our grocery competition for the second time! The 55-year-old from Madadeni in Newcastle, KZN, first won R2 500 worth of grocery vouchers in 2015 and was overjoyed when it happened again. The lucky mama said she couldn&rsquo;t believe the news when the SunTeam called her last week. &ldquo;Winning in 2015 was a shock, but becoming a winner yet again was an even bigger surprise. &ldquo;This is a great feeling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It came at the perfect time because Good Friday emptied my pockets. The vouchers will come in handy because we have welcomed a new member to our family.&rdquo; She said she was planning on hosting a family gathering to celebrate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a while since we spent quality time together as a family. I am planning to host a family dinner where we can all come together and catch up. I&rsquo;ll use the rest of the money to spoil myself. I have not done that in a while. &ldquo;Daily Sun, thank you for this gift. I won&rsquo;t stop entering the competition, as it has changed my life twice.&rdquo; Perpecia, who lives with seven family members, said everyone would be happy after she had done her shopping. &ldquo;We all know how expensive everything is these days, especially food. But with Daily Sun, things have been better. My family told me I could only win once but now I&rsquo;ve proven them wrong as I have struck the jackpot twice!&rdquo;
