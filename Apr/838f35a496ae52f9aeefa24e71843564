HOUSES, farms, cattle, cars and a luxury boat are among assets worth half a billion rand that have been seized from a syndicate involving a senior government official who looted state funds from the Department of Transport in KZN. The KZN National Prosecuting Authority's (NPA) this morning seized assets worth more than R543 million &nbsp;from the property of the department's Siphiwe Christopher Majola and several service providers. Majola reportedly received millions in kickbacks from Durban plant hire companies that were awarded contracts to repair KZN's roads.In 2010 the police's anti-corruption task team investigated allegations of theft, fraud and corruption at the department in Pietermaritzburg. It emerged that the department's service providers had fraudulently been given several tenders from the department for for plant and earthmoving equipment on behalf of the department.The awarding of the tenders was preceded by several irregularities including fraudulently dodging the department's supply chain management processes.Among other fraudulent activities, the service providers invoiced and charged the department for excessive amounts for services they claimed to have provided and services which were never given. Several big corrupt payments were also made to or on behalf of department officials.The investigation revealed that over a period of five years, starting from April 2007 to May 2012, the department awarded several contracts totalling R543 328 926.62 to Barleda 232 CC, Queensburgh Equipment Rental CC and Ubunye Plant Hire CC.According to a 2013 Daily News report, Majola, who was in charge of awarding short-term road repair and maintenance contracts to various companies on the provincial database, allegedly by-passed internal procurement procedure controls that were meant to spread contracts among various small contractors.Majola reportedly awarded the bulk of the work to companies owned by a Durban couple, Nesha and Meganathan Govender.According to the evidence put together by Advocate Knorx Molelle, the senior deputy director of public prosecutions and Captain Sibusiso Lawrence Khawula of the Hawks, Majola received several corrupt payments including:* R430 650 for the purchase of a Mercedes Benz C280* R1,5 million for the purchase of Fernely Farm* several cash payments totalling R5 million paid towards the purchase of the farm* R83 072 for the building of a swimming pool at his house * R146 308 for architectural drawings of a house* R224 800 to buy cattle feed for Majola's farm.On 31 March Justice van Zyl at the KZN High Court in Pietermaritzburg secured the AFU a restraining order to seize the assets amounting to more than R543 million.The matter is expected back in court in June 2017.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-npa-seizes-half-a-billion-rand-in-assets-from-corrupt-official-20170407&nbsp;
