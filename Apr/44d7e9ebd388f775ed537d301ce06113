VUWANI in Limpopo has again been shut down by residents.This was after the Demarcation Board rejected a submission to have the area excluded from the new Lim345 Municipality.Last year, furious residents shut down the town for almost five months in protest over the new municipal boundaries.The shutdown and ensuing violent protests saw more than 30 schools and a post &shy;office burnt down.After the announcement last week that the submission to have Vuwani excluded from the new municipality had been rejected, traditional leaders said they didn&rsquo;t want any services from the new municipality.The residents say they don&rsquo;t understand why they have been included in a municipality demanded by the residents of Malamulele &ndash; not them.The community of Vuwani had a meeting where it was agreed that a shutdown would be enforced until the demarcation decision was reversed. Pro-Makhado task team spokesman Nsovo Sambo said the situation would not change until there was a solution to the problem.&ldquo;We believe this issue needs political intervention. &ldquo;No shops, municipal offices, banks or schools will be allowed to operate until the demarcation decision is reversed,&rdquo; said Sambo.Limpopo government spokesman Phuti Seloba said they would continue to engage with the people in an effort to reach an amicable solution.Police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said two suspects were arrested for malicious damage to property and incitement to commit public violence, after passing vehicles were stoned. They will appear in the Malamulele Magistrates Court soon.
