AFTER dating for 15 years, Ernest and his sweetheart Nompumelelo finally tied the knot in 2012. But hardly five years into the marriage, the couple from Krugersdorp, Mogale City, has separated. Ernest Mmeko claims his wife left him for a broke boyfriend &ndash; but not before she allegedly stole R15 000 of his hard-earned money. The 45-year-old said he was heartbroken and wanted his money back. He told Daily Sun his problems started in 2013 when he sent Nompumelelo to a nursing school. &ldquo;I thought she was staying at the school only to find out that she was sleeping at another man&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said Ernest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m heartbroken but I want justice and my money back.&rdquo; Nompumelelo Mmeko (37), said her husband was lying. &ldquo;I never left on my own. He kicked me out! &ldquo;And yes, I took money, but not that amount. &ldquo;I took it because he did not want to pay school fees for our daughter.&rdquo; Krugersdorp police confirmed that a case has been opened for investigation. Spokesman Sergeant Tshepiso Mashele said: &ldquo;No one has been arrested at this stage.&rdquo;
