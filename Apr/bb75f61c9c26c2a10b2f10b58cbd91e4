PARLIAMENT has postponed the motion of no confidence in president Jacob Zuma, said&nbsp; Parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mothapo in a statement. The motion was scheduled for 18 April per request of the DA leader Mmusi Maimane. The postponement comes after the United Democratic Movement has been granted access to the Constitutional Court over their calls for a secret ballot. Moloto said the postponement of the motion will be referred to the National Assembly Programme Committee for its consideration after the constituency period.
