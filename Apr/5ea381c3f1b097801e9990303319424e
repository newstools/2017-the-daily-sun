DJ SHIMZA and Twins On Decks might have to face the music for not pitching for a gig they were allegedly paid for.The DJs were booked to play on 1 April at Bohemian Lounge in Auckland Park, Joburg, but failed to pitch.According to reliable sources, many people bought tickets to see Shimza perform, as they knew he would play early.&ldquo;The venue was packed to capacity and they kept on telling people Shimza and the Twins On Decks would be on later on that night,&rdquo; said the source. Another source told Sunday Sun there were booking problems because DJ Shimza was booked in Botswana that day and attended that gig.The source added: &ldquo;Twins On Decks asked the venue manager if they could come to the venue at 12am. But the venue manager told them he couldn&rsquo;t say much on the matter as he&rsquo;s only the venue manager and Patrick &ldquo;Prince Pezzy&rdquo;Sikonde is the one who deals with artists.&rdquo;The source further said the artist had a contract with a brewer which sponsored the event. Shimza has allegedly denied having a contract with any beer company, but it is rumoured that SAB will be taking him to court.When asked to comment, event organiser Prince Peezy, said: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true Shimza and Twins On Decks didn&rsquo;t show up for their event and Twins On Decks apologised.&rdquo;Shimza was not available for comment, but his manager, known only as Melena, said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Shimza was where he was booked on the day. I don&rsquo;t know anything about the event you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; Twins On Decks referred the SunTeam to their manager, Ryan Rigney, who said they met up with the parties involved on Tuesday and everything was sorted out. &ldquo;It was miscommunication, but the misunderstanding was sorted,&rdquo; he said.
