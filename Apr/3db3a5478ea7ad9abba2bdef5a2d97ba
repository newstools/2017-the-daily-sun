SHAKES MASHABA&rsquo;S dismissal case is delaying the announcement of the new Bafana Bafana coach.Mashaba&rsquo;s lawyer Claudio Bollo and the South African Football Association&rsquo;s Mark Thompson will meet again tomorrow and on Tuesday, in a bid to reach a settlement agreement out of court. Bollo told SunSport the case might drag on a bit longer if they fail to resolve the matter amicably. Mashaba was fired in December for bringing the Association into disrepute. This was after he got suspended for a public outburst on his bosses after he guided Bafana to a 2-1 win against Senegal in a World Cup qualifier in Polokwane on 12 November. Said Bollo: &ldquo;We had two days on Thursday and Friday, trying to resolve the matter, and we will again meet on Monday and Tuesday. Hopefully, we will find a solution.&rdquo; It was reported that Safa tabled an initial offer of R1&thinsp;million (two months&rsquo; salary) on Thursday, but Mashaba and his legal team declined the amount, insisting on the equivalent of six months&rsquo; salary (R3&thinsp;million). Bollo could not deny nor confirm that they declined Safa&rsquo;s offer. He went on: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to settle out of court, but the stumbling block is that there are different contentions. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go into details with the numbers because that&rsquo;s a confidential matter between the two parties. We might resolve the issue on Tuesday or it may drag all the way to court
