MONICA Molusi nearly died of grief following two tragic deaths in her family.She finally found closure when she put up their tombstones.But the 50-year-old&rsquo;s wounds were reopened on Saturday when she found one of the tombstones had been vandalised. Monica, from Dobsonville Gardens in Soweto, said her son committed suicide in 2010.&ldquo;He was found hanging in his bedroom. He did not even leave behind a note.&rdquo;Monica said her mum Maggie Ntini, who was 91 years old at the time, could not bear the news of her favourite grandson&rsquo;s death.On the day of his funeral the gogo suffered a stroke at home. She died soon afterwards and the family was left reeling from yet another death.&ldquo;I cried day and night because I thought God had abandoned me,&rdquo; said Monica.Her friends and relatives advised her to have tombstones put up for her mum and them so that she could find peace.&ldquo;Things changed after I erected tombstones for them. I finally accepted what had happened. I did not forget, but I found peace.&rdquo;Then her sense of peace was shattered when she went to the cemetery at the weekend to check her loved ones&rsquo; graves.Her mum&rsquo;s tombstone had been vandalised and some of its parts stolen.&ldquo;I curse whoever did this.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t put these stones on graves for fun. We do it to put our hearts at ease. When you steal , you bring back all the pain we are trying to run away from.&rdquo;Joburg City Parks spokesman Molefe Seale said: &ldquo;We appeal to families that have experienced theft or vandalism to report this to their local police station. &ldquo;Families are urged not to leave any valuables, including urns, on the graves of loved ones. &ldquo;City Parks appeals to mourners to remain vigilant and report all crimes to the administrators and security at the entrance to the cemetery.&rdquo;
