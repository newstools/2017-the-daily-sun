NTHABISENG Moeketsi says she drinks to help cope with the pain she endured in her childhood.But the 33-year-old from Cosmo City in Ekurhuleni denies not caring for her kids.Neighbours say she neglects her three kids aged one, six and eight.Nthabiseng told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I love alcohol with all my heart but I will never forsake my children. &ldquo;When I go drinking, I make sure I&rsquo;ve cooked for them. &ldquo;Anyway, the tavern is nearby so I&rsquo;m always close when they need me.&rdquo; Nthabiseng said she got a restraining order against the father of the children after he came home drunk and beat her up really badly in front of the kids. He also broke all the windows of her new RDP. Nthabiseng said she lost her mum in 2000, when she was allegedly killed by a friend, and in 2011, she lost her firstborn son.&ldquo;He fell into the dam at Cosmo City. I wasn&rsquo;t drinking at the time.&rdquo; Social development spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said they will arrange for social workers to visit the family to assess the situation. &ldquo;If there are issues of post-traumatic stress disorder or child neglect they will certainly need to intervene. &ldquo;If the mother needs help, we may have to remove the children from her care until she is able to look after them properly,&rdquo; said Mbangwa.
