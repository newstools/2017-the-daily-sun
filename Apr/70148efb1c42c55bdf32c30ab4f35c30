INGANATHI Gobeni&rsquo;s family from Samora Machel in Cape Town is devastated after he was found hanging in a public toilet on Friday afternoon. Nosiphathise Nobom (43) said she got the shock of her life when she learnt of her son&rsquo;s death while at work. &ldquo;It was unbelievable because when I left home, my son was quite alright. The news came as a shock. I&rsquo;m really in pain to lose him in such a way.&rdquo; Inganathi (14) was at home with his sister Lusanda Nobom (15) just before he killed himself. Lusanda said they were about to prepare food and Inganathi was washing dishes. &ldquo;He left the dishes he was washing and went outside and I didn&rsquo;t bother to ask where he was going. &ldquo;After some time I started to look for him everywhere, even at his friends&rsquo; houses, but everyone said they hadn&rsquo;t seen him,&rdquo; said Lusanda, with tears pouring down her cheeks. She said when she opened the toilet she was shocked to see her brother hanging from a white cloth. &ldquo;I screamed and told my father, who had just arrived home. &ldquo;I asked him to run and cut off the cloth but he told me to leave.&rdquo;The family is still shocked and Nosiphathise said: &ldquo;I do not know what got into my child. He liked school and wanted to be a lawyer.&rdquo; But Lusanda said her brother had confided in her about dropping out of school and said he wanted to keep it a secret. Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident. &ldquo;Circumstances surrounding the death of a 14-year-old boy are under investigation. An inquest docket has been opened.&rdquo;
