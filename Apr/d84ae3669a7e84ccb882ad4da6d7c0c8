WHEN Nomsa Nkomo kissed her son goodbye when he left for school two weeks ago, she didn&rsquo;t know it would be the last time she&rsquo;d see him. As Vuyo Nkomo (19) was coming back from school later that day, he was allegedly killed by a Toyota Quantum belonging to the cops. The mum (45) from Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun her pain was made worse because the cop who was behind the wheel when it happened promised to pay for the funeral but later refused. Kindhearted residents helped Nomsa bury her son on Monday. Vuyo&rsquo;s body had been lying in the mortuary for two weeks.A furious Nomsa said: &ldquo;I will never see my son again because of this reckless cop.&ldquo;What&rsquo;s even worse is that the cop didn&rsquo;t show remorse for killing my child.&rdquo; His sister Annah Nkomo (25) said: &ldquo;The officer and his family came to see us and asked for forgiveness. &ldquo;We told them we didn&rsquo;t have the money to bury my brother. They promised they would pay for the funeral costs, but it turned out to be an empty promise.&rdquo; Nomsa said she tried to call the cop&rsquo;s mum and his girlfriend about the funeral arrangements, but they avoided her calls.Gauteng police spokesman Kay Makhubele said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated.
