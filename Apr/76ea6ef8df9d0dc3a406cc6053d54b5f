THE bus stop used to be plagued by crime many years ago, with many commuters being robbed of all their belongings.Residents saw fit to name the notorious bus stop &ldquo;KwaS&rsquo;gebengu&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;thugs&rsquo; zone&rdquo;.But now single women and mums of B section in Umlazi want it to be renamed.The single women said men would not visit once they heard where they lived, and mums said it could ruin their children&rsquo;s good behaviour.They said they want it to be renamed to something that encourages love and unity in the area.Resident Nosipho Gcabashe (32) said that for being single for five years, she blamed the name. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost five men because of it. Men in this area don&rsquo;t ask for love from me because I grew up with them. Men from other areas do approach me, but when they hear that I live near KwaS&rsquo;gebengu they run and do not look back. &ldquo;They think the area is full of crime,&rdquo; said Nosipho. &ldquo;This name must be changed!&rdquo;Another resident, Ndumiso Masondo (43) said he fears the name could be a bad influence on local youth, including his 15-year-old son. &ldquo;I always praise them for being good, but they will soon think, what is the use of being good while the area you live in has a bus stop called KwaS&rsquo;gebengu? &ldquo;Our leaders must do something about this.&rdquo;Local councillor Sibusiso Maphumulo said they would look into the KwaS&rsquo;gebengu matter.&ldquo;I agree the name does not sound good and I am glad that the residents noticed it too. I will have to speak to other councillors so that the matter can be dealt with,&rdquo; said Maphumulo.
