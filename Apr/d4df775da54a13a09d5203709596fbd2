ORLANDO Pirates hopes of winning silverware this season gained huge momentum when they reached the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup after defeating Bloemfontein Celtic 2-1 in extra-time at Orlando Stadium yesterday.Pirates joined Chippa United, Golden Arrows and defending champions SuperSport United in the last four of the Ke Yona competition.The draw for the semi-finals is scheduled for tomorrow.Both teams started off on a slow pace in the first stanza and the two goalkeepers Siyabonga Mpontshane of Pirates and Patrick Tignyemb of Celtic were untested as referee Kulasande Qongqo whistled for halftime.However, the second stanza was more electrifying as both teams went all out seeking for an opener.Abbubaker Mobara broke the deadlock with 9 minutes played in the second half to give Bucs a 1-0 lead.But Pirates fans were later silenced when their former player Kabelo Mahlasela with few minutes in the pitch found the equaliser for the visiting side. Mahlasela nearly banged his second for the night but Mpontshane came to the rescue for his side as the match went for extra-time. Pirates&rsquo; second half substitute Thamsanqa Gabuza sealed the match in the 103rd minute when he was left alone inside Celtic&rsquo;s box and he headed the ball in to give his side that much needed win.&nbsp;
