THE alleged killer of the Mnyandu family&rsquo;s pregnant daughter held the key to their unanswered questions. But that was not to be.The suspect allegedly hanged himself on Wednesday!On Tuesday, Nomfundo Mnyandu (29) from Nsukangihlale Village at Ceza in Ulundi, northern KZN, was brutally killed. Her father Manesi (67) said: &ldquo;We were hoping he would face the full might of the law for robbing us of our beloved one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has caused us so much pain and left us with many unanswered questions.&rdquo; He said Nomfundo, who was nine months pregnant, had disappeared on Tuesday from her outside room. &ldquo;We became suspicious when her boyfriend told us she had disappeared following an argument. &ldquo;When we went to check in her room we noticed bloodstains. When we asked him about it, he claimed my daughter was about to give birth. &ldquo;The bloodstains led us to where her body was. She was lying dead in a pool of blood in the bush,&rdquo; said Mnyandu. He said the suspect was not the father of the baby. The couple had been dating since November.&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t involved in her love affairs, but I suspect she broke up with the father of the baby in the early stages of her pregnancy.&rdquo;Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, KZN police spokesman, said: &ldquo;Ceza cops are investigating a murder case.&rdquo;
