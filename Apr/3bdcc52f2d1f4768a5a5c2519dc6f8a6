5FM&rsquo;S loss is METRO FM&rsquo;s gain.&nbsp;As the radio talent merry-go-round makes headlines, two SABC commercial radio stations find themselves in opposite camps over migrating DJs.In a rare move, Metro FM went fishing for fresh talent in their sister station 5FM&rsquo;s tank.And they lured the highly-respected DJ Thato Sekwane to their ship.Thato, popularly known as &ldquo;DJ Fresh&rdquo;, will be jumping 5FM&rsquo;s ship to join Metro as a breakfast show host from tomorrow.DJ Fresh, aka &ldquo;Big Dawg&rdquo;, will replace another veteran &ndash; DJ Glen Lewis, who left Metro for Touch HD.DJ Fresh took to social media to bid his 5FM listeners a warm farewell.&nbsp;Another surprise move was by Glen Lewis&rsquo;s former breakfast show co-host Unathi Msengana, who announced her departure.Fans were shocked on Friday morning when Unathi announced on her Instagram page that she was doing her last show.The Idols judge posted a picture that was captioned: Well, that was my LAST SHOW on Metro! Thank you for YOUR love over the past decade.&nbsp;It was unclear where Unathi was heading to as she did not speculate about her future.But Sunday Sun sources say Unathi was unhappy about co-hosting the 8am to 10am show with Khanyi Mbau.On Monday, during Tbo Touch&rsquo;s new DJ line-up announcement, he publicly declared war on Metro FM.Touch said he would continue poaching their radio presenters until they gave him a chance to do one more show at the station to say goodbye to his fans.And Touch is also said to be pursuing Robert Marawa and Bonang Matheba.Meanwhile, after a decade with 5FM, DJ Fresh officially resigned from the station. He confirmed he was crossing the floor to Metro FM, where he would take over the Breakfast Show, which was formerly presented by Unathi and Glen Lewis.Fresh confirmed the allegations and was quoted on 5FM&rsquo;s Rob and Fix show as having said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited. That kind of &lsquo;literally, pee yourself&rsquo; excited. There is zero-fear.&ldquo;This is the fulfilment of a 30-year dream &ndash; the opportunity to be on Metro FM,&rdquo; he said.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said he won&rsquo;t comment on the new line-up.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll release our new line-up when we launch the station&rsquo;s new website tomorrow,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;People should listen to the station from 12pm. the line up would have changed. But I won&rsquo;t tell you who is where until people listen for themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unathi could not be reached for comment.&nbsp;
