Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant announced on Friday afternoon that the bus strike is now over as the majority of unions have reached an agreement.Earlier on Friday the National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) emphasised that it has not signed agreements with any employers in the bus passenger sector."We only negotiate through the Bargaining Council and we wish to re-iterate that it is Numsa policy that only the general secretary can sign agreements on behalf of the union," it said in a statement."However, we look forward to our engagement with the Minister of Labour and the employers today. We hope for a speedy resolution to the dispute."News24&nbsp;reported earlier that Autopax, the operator of Translux and City to City, has confirmed it has signed a wage agreement which will effectively see its services operational on Friday.Some routes may still experience problems as services return to operation.Workers in the passenger bus sector on Wednesday went on strike, demanding a 15% wage increase and better working conditions. Numsa said the intervention of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration had not addressed the union's grievances and it resolved to call a strike.
