IT&rsquo;S a day the little ones will remember for the rest of their lives.Bumble Bees Kidiez Zone principal Joyce Twala and Blue Sea principal Veronique Mbiatchou took their kids for a helicopter ride at Rand Airport in Germiston, Ekurhuleni on Friday. The two creches are in Bramley, near Alexandra, Joburg.&ldquo;The children talk about the experience all the time. &ldquo;When they hear the sound of an aeroplane or helicopter, they run out of the classroom to watch the plane in the air,&rdquo; Joyce said.She said they took the children for the ride because they had a transport theme on their curriculum. Veronique said they wanted to do this every year when they have the transport theme.&ldquo;We will need sponsors to help us on our next trip. &ldquo;Some of our children couldn&rsquo;t make the trip because their parents didn&rsquo;t have the money to contribute. &ldquo;We hope next time we can take all the children.&rdquo;
