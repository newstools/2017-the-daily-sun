ANC STALWARTS have called on the party to recall Jacob Zuma as head of state.Stalwart Murphy Morobe told journalists at a press briefing the ANC must use the powers invested in it by elected structures to recall the president.For months the veterans have been asking the ANC leadership for a meeting to discuss holding a consultative conference, but after the reshuffle the stalwarts now feel Zuma must be recalled. &ldquo;We trust the elected structures to do what they are empowered to do,&rdquo; Morobe said.The veterans said they had recently been frustrated when they tried to meet with the ANC top six. The latest response they got was from secretary general Gwede Mantashe, who said the leadership could not meet them on Monday as they were going to be too busy.The veterans could not clarify whether they would encourage ANC MPs to vote with opposition parties on a motion of no confidence if it is tabled in parliament, as is being requested.Veteran Cheryl Carolus said the reshuffle and the death of stalwart Ahmed Kathrada were painful events for them as early cadres of the movement.She said it was unprecedented for Zuma not even to call the family of his departed comrade to convey his condolences.Carolus said for Zuma to recall former finance minister Pravin Gordhan from the UK was designed to embarrass him.Zuma had crossed the line by reshuffling Cabinet without consulting the leadership, she said.&ldquo;It has never happened in this country before that a person decides to fire half of the ministers and doesn&rsquo;t consult anyone. &ldquo;Leaders have said he didn&rsquo;t consult them, so who is he consulting?&rdquo; she asked.The veterans said they would continue to pursue a consultative conference with ANC leadership.
