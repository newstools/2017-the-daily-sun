NONDUMISO Nkalanga (29) refuses to let her mental illness hold her back. Since 2015, she has been a business studies student and will be finishing the course at the end of June. She believes her prospects of landing a job are pretty good because she has been a star student ever since she enrolled for the course at Global Village College.Nondumiso, from Los-My-Cherry in Mpumalanga, said: &ldquo; I was born with epilepsy and later developed psychosis, but none of that will not stop me from chasing my dreams.&ldquo;I did not want to entertain the idea of earning a disability grant for the rest of my life. &ldquo;I use my grant money to further my studies so that I won&rsquo;t depend on it for life. &ldquo;As soon as I complete my studies and land a perfect job, I will cancel the grant.&rdquo;Nondumiso said she finds the field of business interesting and challenging, and believes she will be a successful businesswoman in the near future. &ldquo;I have been a go-getter for as long as I can remember, even though I have to work harder than other people because of my condition.&rdquo; Nondumiso uses her disability grant to pay for her studies and transport. She also uses the money to buy food and clothes for her three siblings. &ldquo;I want to complete my studies in June, and any form of assistance would be much appreciated.&rdquo;
