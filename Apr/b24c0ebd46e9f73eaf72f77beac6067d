SLATES control the ANC, preventing skilled cadres from being put in place.This is according to the party&rsquo;s policy document about organisational renewal and design, to be presented at the upcoming policy conference in June.Presenting the document at Luthuli House in Joburg yesterday, subcommittee chairman Fikile Mbalula admitted the party was full of factionalism.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t respect the eye of the needle in the organisation. The eye of the needle gives us guidelines on what kind of leadership is needed,&rdquo; he said.In ANC terms, the eye of the needle shows leaders should be chosen carefully.He added that slates obstruct party policies.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking about slates but what has been done about it? Nothing.&rdquo; Mbalula said the subcommittee will propose a revolutionary electoral commission to screen potential or nominated leaders, served by veterans who have no interest in being voted into party posts.Mbalula said the document recognised the danger of institutionalised factionalism. &ldquo;Unlike pre-1990, the ANC is not rapidly training and deploying competent cadres.&rdquo; He added that what leaders were discussing privately needed to be made public. &ldquo;The ANC can renew itself without losing its traditional outlook.&rdquo;
