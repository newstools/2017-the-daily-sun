MANY Sassa recipients have come forward to complain about illegal deductions from their grants.This is despite promises from social development that the renewed contract with Cash Paymaster Services would get rid of the illegal withdrawals.Yesterday, Right2Know members and Sassa beneficiaries picketed outside parliament in Cape Town, demanding that Sassa stops the deductions. Group leader Vainola Makan from Right2Know said people who had lost money should be refunded and said the Sassa system had to be redesigned to stop the deductions. Makan said they wanted Minister Bathabile Dlamini to be fired. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s incompetent yet still has her job, while competent ministers were fired. We want her to go now.&rdquo; The group plans to picket every Tuesday until grant recipients who lost money through illegal deductions are paid back. Last week, Sassa regional manager Bandile Maqetuka admitted to receiving reports on deductions and said officials were working with CPS to reach the truth. Makan said people lost money due to airtime, electricity, loan and funeral policy deductions. &ldquo;We want the beneficiaries&rsquo; private information to be secure.&rdquo; Most picketers were from Mitchells Plain near Cape Town. &ldquo;We want the ConCourt to rule in favour of the suffering poor,&rdquo; Makan said.
