Platinum Stars coach Cavin Johnson has demanded his players bring their A-game when they face Golden Arrows in this weekend's Nedbank Cup quarter-final clash.Kick-off at the Princess Magogo Stadium is scheduled for 3pm on Saturday afternoon."We will go out there and fight as hard as we can," Johnson was quoted by his club's website on Friday."Going to the next stage of the Nedbank Cup will be good for the players. It's going to be a hard game. It's going to be tough because Golden Arrows are a good team. They push hard."We expect players to take the game by the scruff of the neck to say we are going forward, but also make sure that we don't give a relay obsession for teams to attack us."Golden Arrows are KwaZulu-Natal's last representatives in the Nedbank Cup, and Clinton Larsen's men will be looking to avenge their 2-0 loss to Stars from earlier this month.But, instead of dwelling on that defeat, the ever optimistic Larsen was looking on the bright side.He told Kickoff, "From our side, I just said to the players a couple of days ago 'right now we are inside the top eight and in the quarters'."We'd like to keep our place in the top eight and progress further in the cup and they will really be rending a great season for us."
