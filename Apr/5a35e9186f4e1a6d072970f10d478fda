Jomo Cosmos may be the last remaining lower league team remaining in the Nedbank Cup, but they will be treated with respect by Chippa United.This was according to Chippa captain Thami Sangweni, who will lead his charges against Cosmos at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth at 3pm on Saturday afternoon in the quarter-final.Chippa haven't been too hot themselves this season, and currently find themselves just three points above the Premiership drop zone.And, Cosmos turned heads by knocking league favourites Bidvest Wits out of the Cup in the previous round."We will not take them for granted because they are playing in the NFD," Sangweni told&nbsp;Kickoff."And we'll take the game as it is and respect Jomo Cosmos' players and everyone. But the most important thing for us us to focus on our own game and try to win it," he said.Speaking earlier in the week, Cosmos mentor Jomo Sono said he didn't think his team was distracted by their run in the cup after their loss to struggling Magesi FC in the National First Division."We made only two mistakes against Magesi and they scored. But for 70 minutes, it was one-way traffic, we had them on the back foot.Sono concluded by adding that if they replicated their second half performance from their game against Magesi, then they had a good chance of progressing to the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup.
