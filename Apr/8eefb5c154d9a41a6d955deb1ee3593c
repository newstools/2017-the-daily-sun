RESIDENTS were devastated when they woke up on Wednesday morning to terrible news. The people of Hillary, Durban found notices saying the local library at Hillary Centre had been closed until further notice.The sudden decision appeared on signs put up outside the centre. Residents said they were not even told the reason for the closure. Community members said they were concerned that the decision by eThekwini Municipality would negatively affect their children&rsquo;s learning. Resident Ntombi Janji (39) said: &ldquo;There is another library in Malvern but it&rsquo;s quite a distance from where we live. &ldquo;Our children, who used to flock to the library after school and on weekends, now have to travel over 1km and sometimes take taxis.&rdquo; Sunil Khan (48) said the library not only helped kids who studied there and borrowed books for school, but also the many adults who love reading. &ldquo;We are hoping that whatever the problem is, the municipality will sort it out and re-open the facility shortly.&rdquo; Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said the library was closed due to unforeseen circumstances. She advised residents who still had books from the library to put them in the drop box which was still being emptied daily. &ldquo;Normal penalties for overdue books will still apply,&rdquo; she said. Mthethwa apologised for the inconvenience caused but advised those who needed a library to go to the one in nearby Malvern to borrow books.
