JOSHUA Zimmerman didn&rsquo;t grow up believing in zangoma but this changed when he faced a life-threatening illness and was cured by the sangoma recommended by a friend. The 27-year-old from Hillbrow, Joburg said ever since he was helped by a sangoma while at university, his life has been happy. &ldquo;I was gravely ill when my friend advised me to consult a sangoma. I was healed after the sangoma told me I was cursed and would only find peace if I used a certain muthi.&rdquo; He said the sangoma also predicted he would find a peaceful home once the curse was gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy where I live. I salute the sangoma who predicted my future.&rdquo; He said people must not speak badly of zangoma as most of them are honest people who do a great job to help people like him.He said his problems started after his parents separated when he was three. &ldquo;The sangoma told me my parents&rsquo; ancestors were fighting over me.&rdquo;Yesterday, Joshua invited the SunTeam along when he consulted sangoma Tiny Tomic in Bramley View, Joburg. He told her he was struggling to find a girlfriend. Joshua said he was eyeing a girl who had a child but the woman didn&rsquo;t notice him. &ldquo;I will go back to Tiny to seek further help.&rdquo; Tiny said Joshua needs to go back to his mum, with whom he&rsquo;s lost contact, for his love life to work out.
