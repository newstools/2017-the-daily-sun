MADALA Frans Mkhombo (64) from Agincourt Village near Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga is a sad man.The madala longs to be reunited with his missing brother Nkhasheni Mkhombo.Frans told Daily Sun: &ldquo;He left home when village elders moered him after he had made someone&rsquo;s wife pregnant. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard from Nkhasheni in years.&rdquo;The worried madala said his brother was born either in 1938 or in 1939. &ldquo;After he left home he was rumoured to be working around Brakpan in Gauteng.&ldquo;But he was apparently later transferred to Vereeniging. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we lost contact with him. It was around 1970.&ldquo;His five sons are not interested in searching for their father, because they regard me as their dad. &ldquo;I want to see him again before I die. That is why I decided to search for him.&ldquo;I want him to know his children. He is my only brother.&ldquo;I believe he is still alive and might be working at a farm around the Vaal. &ldquo;His wife is still waiting for him at home. We would be happy if he could come back,&rdquo; said the madala.If you have any information regarding the whereabout of Nkhasheni, please call 076 016 3581 or 079 533 6759.
