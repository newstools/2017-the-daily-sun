CONSTRUCTION of the long awaited Moloto Rail Corridor begins soon. On Tuesday, Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi visited the construction site in Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga accompanied by his deputy, Sindisiwe Chikunga, and MEC Sasekani Manzini. &ldquo;I am not going to change anything my predecessors have already done, but make sure work begins. &ldquo;The project will address the challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment. The object is to reduce accidents and change socio-economic challenges between Pretoria and Marble Hall.&ldquo;Work is already in progress and will create jobs for local people. We are going to use a new system to tender for work. Everyone will get an opportunity to benefit from the project.&rdquo;He said the rail corridor, including the train and roadworks, will cost government R4,5 billion and 12 000 jobs will be created. Already, 58 000 people have registered for jobs with the project. Maswanganyi said the corridor will offer a safe, fast and accessible connection between Mpumalanga, Gauteng and Limpopo. The rail system will form the backbone of public transport and corridor development. Deputy transport minister Sindisiwe Chikunga said the South African Network for Women in Transport must be supported in all provinces. &ldquo;Women and youth must be given jobs, especially in projects on the roads. Many young people and women will be trained by this big project.&rdquo;Manzini said the focus was on youth and women and asked people to get their co-operatives in order to benefit.
