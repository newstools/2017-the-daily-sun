KZN Transport MEC Mxolisi Kaunda has called for a week of mourning following dozens of deaths on the province&rsquo;s roads over the past week. Kaunda made the call after yet another horrific crash claimed the lives of nine people on the N2, in Umzumbe near Port Shepstone on the South Coast, on Monday. He said: &ldquo;I had just returned from an emotional meeting with families of the victims of the Ntunjambili accident, which happened on Saturday, when I heard the news. &ldquo;We have hardly come to terms with Saturday&rsquo;s bus crash. &ldquo;Now we have to face up to the loss of roughly the same number of people in two separate crashes involving multiple minibuses. &ldquo;We wish to appeal to drivers, especially of minibuses and buses, to remain calm, focused and to strictly follow the road rules and traffic signs.&rdquo; A few hours before the Umzumbe crash, three people were killed in a car crash on the N3 near Mooi River. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;Two of the taxis were apparently travelling south and another one was travelling north when the collision occurred. &ldquo;Nine people died, three of whom were children.&rdquo; The driver of one taxi was among the dead, while the second vehicle&rsquo;s driver was injured. The third driver was unharmed.A culpable homicide case was opened for investigation. In another accident on Monday, one man died and six were injured when a black BMW crashed into vehicles on the side of the road. The accident happened on the N2 in Ballito, north of Durban.
