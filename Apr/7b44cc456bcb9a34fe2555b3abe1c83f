THE ANC has imprisoned the poor, who believe they will not be able to survive without party hand-outs. This is the view of anti-apartheid activist Dr Mamphela Ramphele, who has tried to explain the reluctance of some South Africans to hold the government to account in her new book, Dreams, Betrayal and Hope. She said: &ldquo;Many citizens are now prisoners of the ANC. They believe that without the ANC they will not have grants or RDPs.&rdquo; Speaking of her short time as the leader of Agang SA, she described politics as &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; and vowed never to return to that space. She said, however, she believed that well-organised citizens are a strong force. She refused to be labelled a quitter for leaving her party shortly after its terrible performance in the 2014 national election. Ramphele said she believed calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down were short-sighted because the ANC was on a path to destruction and it would soon lose power. &ldquo;The ANC is killing itself. They are going through a painful, slow suicidal death,&rdquo; she said. Ramphele said it was sad that the majority of people, particularly black people, were not aware of the power of their vote.
