We protested and were told the officials were not paid for overtime. &ldquo;About 30 people were told to go home. &ldquo;I was at the back of the queue. I am desperate to get my ID as I am going to initiation school in June. &ldquo;I am disappointed as I wasted my time and taxi fare.&rdquo;Andile said he had been in the queue for almost three hours before being turned back.
