MAMELODI Sundowns were yesterday booted out of the Nedbank Cup following a 1-0 defeat to Golden Arrows in the last 16 round match played at the Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville.Arrows winger Nduduzo Sibiya scored the solitary goal that broke the hearts of the Brazilians fans who looked frustrated. Sibiya, who gave Downs defenders all sorts of trouble in the first half finally grabbed the winner in the 66th minutes when he slotted the ball past a bemused keeper Kennedy Mweene.This was a sweet revenge for the KwaZulu Natal side who got humiliated 3-0 by the Brazilians in the first round of their league encounter. Downs coach Pitso Mosimane looked lonely on the sidelines as he asked himself what needs to be done to lift his players&rsquo; confidence and bring their slump to a halt. This was Downs&rsquo; sixth match without a win, something that their fans are not used to. The last time the Tshwane giants tasted victory was on 6 March when they beat SAB Regional League side Mariveni United 2-0 in the last 32 round of Ke Yona Cup, while their last Absa Premiership victory was on 25 February when they beat Bidvest Wits by the same margin.Mosimane made five changes to the side that drew goalless with Celtic in their last league match at the same venue on Wednesday. He gave veteran players Thabo Nthethe, Mzikayise Mashaba and Anele Ngcongca a rare start, while Motjeka Madisha was also given the chance to prove his worth.Mosimane was hoping the fringe players will bring the much needed spark that seems to have deserted the Brazilians. On the other hand, Arrows came into the match with their confidence high having beaten relegation haunted Highlands Park 2-1 in their last league match who saw them occupy sixth spot on the league table. Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende have been enjoying football under the guidance of coach Clinton Larsen as they demolished Maritzburg United 3-1 at home in the first round of the South African version of the famous FA Cup.
