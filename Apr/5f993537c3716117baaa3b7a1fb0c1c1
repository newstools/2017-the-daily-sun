The greatest source of pleasure and pain is being in a relationship. All of us carry fond memories of our first love and we still remember the harsh sting of a failed relationship. Every relationship is a roller coaster ride filled with ups and downs.The best way to have better relationships with those around you is to improve the relationship you have with yourself. Matthew 22:36-40 reads: &ldquo;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?&rsquo; Jesus said to him: &lsquo;You shall love your neighbour as yourself.&rdquo; This means that getting along with yourself is more important than getting along with others. Most people get married because they hope their partner will complete them. They become a burden to their spouse, and their expectations become the source of all sorts of trouble that leads to divorce. If you fall in love with yourself, the love you give to others is valuable. But if you do not love yourself, people will want nothing to do with the love you offer them. The foundation of loving others is in loving yourself. You need to learn how to love yourself before tying the knot.
