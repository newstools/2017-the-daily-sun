WHEN thugs killed one of their neighbours at a restaurant, villagers went on the rampage, hunting the suspects down. Then their anger turned to the police and they set the cop shop alight.But now these villagers are begging government to rebuild their police station!They&rsquo;ve realised they now have to travel over 30km to get to the nearest police station.The service delivery setback happened at Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo last September.The burning of the cop shop was sparked by the death of Aubrey Maribatse (27), who was attacked at a restaurant while trying to break up a fight. Villagers hunted down the alleged killers and found suspect Kabelo Mathe (29), who they then beat to death.Sekgopo villagers said they now have to fork out R28 for transport to get to Modjadjiskloof Police Station.Yesterday they pleaded with government to either renovate the burned cop shop or build a new one. They said crime in their area has risen since it was burned down.&ldquo;We are tired also of going to Modjadjiskloof just to certify some papers. When crime takes place in the village, police always arrive very late due to the distance they have to travel. Thugs are using this to their advantage,&rdquo; said one 28-year-old resident.&ldquo;Last month, heavy rain cut off power in the village at night and thugs saw an opportunity to do their dirty work. &ldquo;Over 10 homes were broken into but there was nothing police could do because of the distance,&rdquo; the resident added.Residents also pleaded with fellow villagers to stop destroying infrastructure intended to bring service delivery.Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said residents will have to speak to different officials to get their cop shop back. &ldquo;They should also meet with the Modjadjiskloof station commander and discuss their situation,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.
