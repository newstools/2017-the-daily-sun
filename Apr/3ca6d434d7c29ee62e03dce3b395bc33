DEPUTY transport minister Sindisiwe Chikunga says road safety campaigns are not having the desired effect . . . This comes after all 29 taxis that underwent roadworthy tests at the Mariannhill toll plaza roadblock on the N3 failed the test on Sunday!She said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very upset. We hold far too many road safety campaigns.&ldquo;But many taxis still have brake problems, bald, smooth or plain tyres, and many other technical problems. &ldquo;They put passengers and other road users&rsquo; lives at risk.&rdquo; The three taxi drivers were arrested for driving without public driver&rsquo;s permits, and their taxis were impounded, forcing commuters to wait for hours for alternative transport.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to tolerate this. We&rsquo;re going to hit them with heavy penalties,&rdquo; Chikunga told Daily Sun.Many passengers welcomed the Easter roadblocks.Thokozile Mlungwane (34), who was travelling from Gauteng to Durban, said she was happy that drivers who put their lives in danger were arrested.Msizi Dlomo (49), who was also travelling to Durban, said the long wait was worth it. &ldquo;Traffic authorities saved people from being killed or injured,&rdquo; Msizi said.
