ONE minute they were dancing to a stereo blasting on the street! The next they were ducking for cover to escape death from a speeding car. The car allegedly drove straight into party revellers at a street bash at Msilinga Road, J section, KwaMashuon Saturday night . One of the survivors said he saw a Honda Ballade driving at high speed. &ldquo;The next thing it was just metres from us. One of the guys said maybe the guys wanted to start trouble. &ldquo;He suggested I put chairs in the middle of the road to stop the car driving through,&rdquo; she said. However, that didn&rsquo;t help. The car allegedly came straight towards them and left seven people injured. &ldquo;Others managed to escape unharmed. Another survivor said they suspected the four occupants of the car deliberately drove into them. &ldquo;We have never had trouble before. People who come to the street bash are from this area and they have never been violent. &ldquo;There has never been violence here before. This was the first time.&rdquo; The SunTeam went to KwaMashu Clinic, where some of the injured people were taken, but couldn&rsquo;t speak to them as they were still being treated. One of the family members asked the SunTeam to leave. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t speak to you now. Please leave. &ldquo;We are still shocked because some of us didn&rsquo;t even know that our children were at the street bash,&rdquo; a woman said. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of reckless and negligent driving was opened at the KwaMashu cop shop.
