&ldquo;OUR country needs God! Satan is taking over and turning people into murderers.&rdquo; Prophet Paseka Motsoeneng, known as Mboro, yesterday visited the family of Tinyiko Reckson (5), who was stabbed to death and had his blood sucked by a 21-year-old man last week. Mboro was joined at the family home in Orlando, Soweto by actors Lucky Legodi and Jerry Phele, and singer Winnie Khumalo. Mboro said: &ldquo;Soweto has become a den for Satanists to practise their dirty work on our children. We cannot sit by and watch our kids being killed like this.&ldquo;Where are they supposed to play? If they are not safe at school or at home, where can they be protected? We want them to be free and we should pray for their survival.&rdquo; Phele said public figures are also humans and it is right for them to show their respect whenever they can. &ldquo;This is a very sad thing, especially as it happened to a child. We must pray in these difficult times we are living in. Satanism is real.&rdquo; Councillor Sechaba Khumalo said: &ldquo;We are going to make sure Orlando becomes a safe place. There are many things we could be famous for, but not Satanism. We are bigger than that. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now created a close working relationship with the police and the community policing forum. We&rsquo;ll make sure an incident like this doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo; Tinyiko&rsquo;s classmates attended the gathering and described him as a happy boy.
