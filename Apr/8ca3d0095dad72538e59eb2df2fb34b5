Dear MizzB I&rsquo;m 14 years old and I am fat. Boys my age always make fun of me but older guys tell me that I am beautiful. I do not want to be that girl who dates older men. How do I build my self-esteem and feel good about myself? -&nbsp; PrincessDear Princess Being a &ldquo;big&rdquo; girl can be difficult because people have negative opinions about your body. The most important thing is to know who you are and what you want from life. If you want people to love, accept and respect you, it has to start with you. You teach people how to treat you by the way you conduct yourself.If you hate the way your body looks, make the changes you want to see. Otherwise, accept yourself for who you are, focus on the good things and be happy!
