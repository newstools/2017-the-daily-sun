SKHUMBA HLOPHE may be a funny guy, but he allegedly learned the hard way that featuring on Bonang &ldquo;Queen B&rdquo; Matheba&rsquo;s radio show was no joke.&nbsp;This as the comedian was allegedly given the cold shoulder by the radio and TV personality this week, when he showed up for an interview.&ldquo;Skhumba was so excited about being interviewed on The Front Row, he even showed up at SABC&rsquo;s Metro FM studios ahead of time,&rdquo; an insider said.&ldquo;He was so looking forward to the interview, he spent the whole night before preparing for the show.&rdquo;But sources claimed when he showed up for his dream moment, Queen B felt he wasn&rsquo;t good enough &ndash; and demanded someone better.The source claimed: &ldquo;Skhumba was crushed after being told what Bonang had said. He was told the interview would no longer happen.&rdquo;A third informant said Skhumba had already told his friends and posted on social media he&rsquo;d be interviewed on Metro.&ldquo;I can imagine what a beating his ego took,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unclear why Skhumba was turned down. Maybe he made a joke about Queen B.&rdquo;A sympathiser said: &ldquo;We all know his road to success has been a bumpy ride. The poor guy &ndash; from the dusty streets of Tembisa &ndash; is trying to earn a living. For him to be told he&rsquo;s not goood enough for Metro FM is a big blow below the belt.&rdquo;Skhumba refused to comment on the matter. His manager, Sindy Mnguni, said he was to have an interview with Metro.&ldquo;He called me to say there&rsquo;s no longer an interview, but didn&rsquo;t give me reasons why the interview was cancelled,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;Bonang could not be reached for comment.
