WHEN a woman saying she was from the UK&rsquo;s Clydesdale Bank phoned her, a woman from Ivory Park in Midrand thought she would be rich within days. However, it turned out she had been scammed and the resident of the Joburg kasi ended up losing R20 000! The 26-year-old victim told Daily Sun the woman who phoned her claimed her late father had invested money with the bank and she was the beneficiary. But she needed to pay to get the money. Ivory Park police spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said: &ldquo;She fell for the story. She filled in papers sent to her by the caller and made two deposits totalling R20 000 to the scammer.&rdquo; He said the victim became suspicious when the same person came back to her demanding another R150 000. &ldquo;She went to a well-known bank and was told the whole thing was a fraud. She immediately opened a case of fraud with the Ivory Park Police Station,&rdquo; said Matimulane.
