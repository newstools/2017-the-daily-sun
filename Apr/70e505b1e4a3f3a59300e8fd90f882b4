LIVESTOCK farmer Michael Ngwenya (54) from Bungeni, near Elim was shocked when a cow herder told him seven of his cattle had been killed.Michael said he lost R91 000 when his cows were slaughtered on Friday night.He suspects catering companies and shisa nyama owners are to blame. Michael said: &ldquo;I have no doubt they were killed for their meat because only their heads and intestines were left. The culprits have killed me because this is how my family gets by.&rdquo;According to Michael, all the cows were pregnant and were going to give birth in September. Ngwenya added that similar incidents have occurred before, but he never thought it would happen to him.&ldquo;This usually happens towards the festive season and just before the Easter holidays. &ldquo;The thieves clearly do this to cater for their events or sell meat at their butcheries.&rdquo; Cattle herder William Shirinda (69) told Daily Sun he left the cows grazing in the veld.&ldquo;When I went back, seven cows were missing. I looked for them where the others were grazing but I couldn&rsquo;t find them. It was getting late, so I decided to go home and told myself I would find them the next day. &ldquo;But what I discovered the following day was shocking,&rdquo; said William.Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said cops are investigating a case of stock theft.&ldquo;Seven cows were allegedly slaughtered in the bush during the night. &ldquo;Their heads and intestines were left at the scene,&rdquo; said Ngoepe.No arrests have been made yet.
