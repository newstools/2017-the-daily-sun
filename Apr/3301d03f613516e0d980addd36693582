PLATINUM STARS look set to get a piece of good fortune as they take on Association Sportive de Tanda in the second play-off round, first leg clash of the Caf Confederations Cup today (3.30pm) at the Stade Robert Champoroux Stadium.Dikwena left for Ivory Coast on Thursday for their Confederation encounter. They made it to this round by defeating Mozambiquan side Uniao do Songo 2-0 on aggregate in the preliminary round, before winning against Vipers SC from Uganda 3-2 on aggregate in the first round of 16 games. Dikwena are not the only Mzansi team that will be in Confederations Cup clash today, SuperSport United as well. United are visiting Liberia&rsquo;s Barrack Young Controllers at the Blue Field in Monrovia at (4pm). Matsatsantsa reached this round by thumping Al Ahly Shendi 6-3 in aggregate in the first round. It&rsquo;s a common complaint that our teams don&rsquo;t progress far enough in continental competitions. Given that a home-grown Mamelodi Sundowns, who are currently the Champions League reigning champions, perhaps this is the dawn of a new era. If Stars and United can conquer their opponents in this two-legged fixture, they will see themselves in the group stages of the Confederations Cup. South African players tend to struggle when they playing in artificial fields, these two encounters will be one of the toughest considering that they will be playing away in artificial field which might be a problem for Mzansi players. These two teams will need to score at least an away goal to make things easier for them next weekend when they are at home for the second leg. Stars are not new in the Caf competition, in 2008 they played in the African Champions League and Confederations Cup. They lost 3-2 on aggregate to Egyptians giants Al Ahly in the Champions League and lost 4-2 on aggregate to Tunisian side CS Sfaxien at this stage of the Confederations Cup.
