QUEEN of Bling Khanyi Mbau has said she will always remain true to who she is. This was after she was criticised on Twitter for posting a sexy full body photo of herself showing off a considerably lighter skin tone. South African social media commentators wasted no time in slamming her for allegedly having undergone skin lightening treatments. While some came to Khanyi&rsquo;s defence, many ridiculed her by posting old photos of her and memes comparing her to raw chicken breasts. None of these dampened Khanyi&rsquo;s mood. Yesterday she seemed to be unbothered by the abuse. Speaking to Daily Sun, she said: &ldquo;Usually people bash what they don&rsquo;t know or understand. The only thing people need to understand and get clear is that I&rsquo;m still Khanyi Mbau!&rdquo; The Metro FM DJ, who has spoken openly about having undergone cosmetic surgery, responded to her critics in a Tweet on Monday, which read: &ldquo;Twirra since 2005 and you are still on me. Who I marry, what I drive, where I work, how I get my money and now what colour I am!&rdquo; However, she later deleted the Tweet. She told the SunTeam she had no time for negativity.&ldquo;After13 years people are still questioning what I do. I deleted my comments and anything negative. I am too successful to be engaging in such activity,&rdquo; she said.
