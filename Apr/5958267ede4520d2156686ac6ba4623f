POLICE should leave no stone unturned when looking for the five armed robbers who stormed the 9 South African Infantry Battalion Base in Khayelitsha on Friday.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s according to the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco).&nbsp;The suspects stole R4 rifles and ammunition. Sanco spokesprson Jabu Mhlangu said: &ldquo;We are concerned about the ease with which high-calibre weapons and ammunition were robbed from national key points, which are supposed to be highly securitised environments.&nbsp;&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t imagine these weapons a day longer in the hands of mindless and heartless gangsters, who have the potential to unleash terror on communities.&rdquo;&nbsp;Early on Friday morning, six rifles were stolen and soldiers held up during a robbery at the military base in Harare, Khayelitsha.&nbsp;According to on-site reports, the robbers forced the guards inside the base and overpowered five more soldiers stationed in the armoury guard room.&nbsp;It is understood that the robbers then forced the soldiers to open a safe.&nbsp;A staggering total of six rifles were allegedly stolen during the daring robbery.&nbsp;South African National Defence Force spokesperson Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi confirmed the military base robbery.&nbsp;In August last year, a group stole military equipment, assault rifles and hand grenades from the Simon&rsquo;s Town Naval Base.&nbsp;They were arrested.&nbsp;One of the three taken into custody, Duncan Gouvias, was &ndash; earlier in 2017 &ndash; handed an effective 43-year jail sentence. &ndash; News24&nbsp;
