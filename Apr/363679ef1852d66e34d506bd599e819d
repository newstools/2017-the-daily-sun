LINESS Gumulira was preparing chicken for her family on Thursday night when the power went out. The 35-year-old mum from Wattville, Ekurhuleni, stopped cooking &ndash; but she forgot to turn off the stove. The next day while she was at work, the electricity came back on and tragedy struck. The pot melted on the stove, starting a fire that ate all her family&rsquo;s belongings.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe what happened. Everything I worked for went up in smoke in a second. I was at work when I got the horrible news that my shack was burning,&rdquo; she said. After getting the call she rushed back home, to be greeted by a huge cloud of smoke and crowds of people in the yard. Martha Molefe, who lives in the same yard as Liness, said she was asleep when the fire started. &ldquo;I was woken by my granddaughter. I called people to help and we tried to put the fire out with buckets of water, but it was too late.&rdquo;Liness lost a fridge, stove, TV, two beds and clothes.&ldquo;Please, I need help. It can be food or any kind of clothing. I was left with only the clothes on my back.&rdquo; Ekurhuleni Emergency Services arrived when the fire had already been put out.
