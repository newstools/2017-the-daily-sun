KWAITO musician Bhar is hurting, and alleged unpaid fees are the source of his pain.&nbsp;This as the Marula Lounge in Klerksdorp, North West, is rumoured not to have paid the events co-ordinator for his services.&nbsp;&ldquo;They owe me R35 000 for the past two months. These guys aren&rsquo;t taking me seriously, considering that I bring a lot of business to them,&rdquo; Bhar, real name Sifiso Mshengu, said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame the owner because he&rsquo;s not always in the club. The problem lies with other people, who think they&rsquo;re familiar with entertainment.&rdquo;&nbsp;The artist, originally from Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal, said he was fed-up and ready for change .&nbsp;Said Bhar: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be here while my music career is going down the drain.&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s better to starve in Jozi than to work for free in North West.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;They have used me and don&rsquo;t even appreciate my work. I brought artists over to elevate this place to its current status.&rdquo;&nbsp;Bhar plans to leave the club this week to focus on SugarHill Entertainment, his record label.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would rather invest all my energy in my music than kill time here,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;According to the musician, Marula also owed other entertainers, including promoters and actresses.&nbsp;Marula manager, Tebogo Motlaudi, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Bhar is leaving, but he was never fired.&rdquo; Tebogo also denied owing Bhar anything.&nbsp;
