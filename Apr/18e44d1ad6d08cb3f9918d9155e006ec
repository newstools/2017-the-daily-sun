A GATVOL social worker is determined to open a case against six security guards who allegedly assaulted her. The 33-year-old from New Brighton kasi in Port Elizabeth told Daily Sun four female security guards and two of their male colleagues attacked her as she was leaving Dora Nginza Hospital on Sunday evening. &ldquo;I have five-month-old twins and one is in hospital. &ldquo;As I was leaving the hospital at 7.30 pm, I found the gate was locked with a padlock. &ldquo;Suddenly the security guards came up to me and started assaulting me. They said &lsquo;bitch, why are you dumping your child here? You are going back to your boyfriend to make another baby&rsquo;.&rdquo; She said they wouldn&rsquo;t listen to her when she explained she had to check up on her other child. &ldquo;They dragged me back to the hospital and started kicking me. My arms were left swollen and I lost more than R380 in cash and two cellphones during the attack.&rdquo; The angry mum said she would not rest until the guards were punished. &ldquo;I told the nurse in charge what had happened and phoned the municipality. I was told to go to KwaZakhele Police Station but they sent me away and said I should come back when the investigators were on duty.&rdquo; The victim said the hospital told her she would only get a medical report once her child was discharged but the cops said she couldn&rsquo;t open a case without one. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Miranda Mills advised the woman to go back to the police station. &ldquo;I will also give her the cellphone number of a cop she can speak to,&rdquo; she said. Health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said he couldn&rsquo;t comment until he had seen photos of the victim.
