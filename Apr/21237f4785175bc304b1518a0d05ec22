THE North Gauteng High Court has ordered the transport minister to reinstate fired Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa board members. Judge Peter Mabuse yesterday ruled that the interim board which was appointed last month should be set aside. Former Prasa board chairman Popo Molefe filed an urgent application last month for the court to declare unlawful the decision by former transport minister Dipuo Peters to dissolve the board. In his affidavit, Molefe said the decision to remove board members must be set aside to prevent irreversible damage to Prasa. While the application was still being heard last month, Peters named an interim board, which included Nazir Alli, former CEO of South African National Roads Agency. Molefe argued in court papers that &ldquo;the public&rsquo;s interest in Prasa is emphasised by the investigations conducted by the public protector, as well as the auditor-general&rsquo;s 2015 report, which uncovered irregular expenditure at Prasa.&rdquo;He had said the minister fired the board because of ongoing investigations into R14 billion of irregular expenditure.He also claims Peters requested the board submit a report relating to the irregular increase of former acting CEO Collins Letsoalo&rsquo;s salary. Letsoalo was axed after the Sunday Times reported he had demanded a 350% salary increase, taking his annual earnings to R5,9 million. Peters was fired during President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s recent cabinet reshuffle and was replaced by Joe Maswanganyi.She has since resigned as an MP.Ishmael Mnisi, spokesman for the transport department, said they would study the judgment and comment later.
