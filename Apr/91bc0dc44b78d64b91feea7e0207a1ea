Today was meant to be a day of protest against the president&rsquo;s decision to fire former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.In a movement called #BlackMonday, civil society groups urged people to wear black today in protest of the move by the president.However, #BlackMonday has been trending all day, but for the wrong reasons.People have taken to Twitter, to question selective protesting.The conversation became more of a racialized one than about the actual motive of the movement.Twitter has been abuzz with people asking where was #BlackMonday when incidents such as Penny Sparrow&rsquo;s racist remarks and the &ldquo;Spur Bully&rdquo; happened.Where was #BlackMonday? pic.twitter.com/SXx4USSKy5&mdash; Modern Day Pantsula (@Thabiso_Dlamini) April 2, 2017When DA calls mass mobilizations ppl complain that white ppl dont come forward,now theres #blackmonday still ppl complain abt white ppl...&mdash; DoUbLe tAppEr (@TEDDYMANYUHA) April 3, 2017#Blackmonday#WhiteTheftMonday Can we discuss when we getting back what was taken from us&mdash; IG:ChuchuThaps (@chulayok) April 3, 2017#BlackMonday you can't expect 75% of the population to live on 13% 0f land while less than 5% live on over 87%, lets rather much for land.&mdash; FreeEqualJustSociety (@almanook) April 3, 2017So how did #BlackMonday go?
