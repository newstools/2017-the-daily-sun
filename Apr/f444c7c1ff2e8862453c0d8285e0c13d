SuperSport United striker Kingston Nkhatha is a doubtful starter against his former club Kaizer Chiefs in Saturday's Nedbank Cup quarter-final clash at the FNB Stadium.The match in Soweto kicks off at 18H00, with the two teams set to meet again in Pretoria in a &nbsp;league game in seven days time.Nkhatha took a knock in the midweek 0-1 league reverse to Mamelodi Sundowns and the indications have been that he may not recover in time.However, key attacker Thabo Mnyamane will return after he missed the game through suspension.Chiefs on the other hand have a near full strength team available at the business end of the season, with goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo the only absentee.&nbsp;And coach Steve Komphela will also welcome back Bernard Parker after he missed Amakhosi's last game, a 1-0 win over Chippa United, after accumulating four yellow cards.Chiefs are the form side heading into this encounter after a run of 10 wins and four draws in their last 14 matches in all competitions.Matsatsantsa, while doing well in the Nedbank Cup and the CAF Confederation Cup, have not won in their last five league outings, three of which ended in defeat; so it will be an inconsistent away team which takes to the field on Saturday.SuperSport coach Stuart Baxter is hoping the uncertain nature of cup football will benefit his team."I think (Chiefs) know going into this (game) that they will be facing a hungry team that really wants to get back on track.&nbsp;"The run that is behind them and won't count for a lot in this one-off encounter, but they have certainly done a great job to sort of pull themselves around."A host of players sitting just one yellow card away from suspension is another issue Baxter has to deal with against his former club.Komphela concedes that past form will count for little."Playing against a team that's been losing is dangerous, so our approach will be to focus on the game and not on their past results," he said."At Chiefs we have to fight for both matches, the league and the Cup, but we do want to win both."Baxter meanwhile made light of the fact that his squad is packed full of former Amakhosi players."The fact that we have former Kaizer Chiefs players is irrelevant, they are playing for SuperSport United now. To be professional means you have to take all the outside pressure and get on the field and still put in your best performance."
