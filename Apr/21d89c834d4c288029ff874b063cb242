LAST week, South Africa joined the world in commemorating safety, health and welfare at work.&nbsp;According to Section 8 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act: &ldquo;The employer has a duty to ensure employees&rsquo; safety, health and welfare at work, as far as is reasonably practicable.&rdquo;&nbsp;To prevent workplace injuries and ill health, it&rsquo;s compulsory for employers to provide and maintain a safe workplace, which uses safe equipment, among other requirements.&nbsp;This month also high-lighted the importance of looking after one&rsquo;s self, and how our health was crucial to performing at our best.&nbsp;Most people spend their time at work, so it&rsquo;s crucial that the working conditions or environment of places of employment be safe for employees.&nbsp;Big and small companies have to adapt to the Safety Act and create a working environment that won&rsquo;t put workers at risk.&nbsp;Agnes Maphumulo, who owns a catering company that employs 20 people, said food was a very delicate component, which made it easy for people to get food poisoning.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have a procedure that we use as a team because the service we render is very important. As a team leader, I make sure that we work under good conditions and are always extra-careful,&rdquo; Agnes said.&nbsp;&ldquo;There are things you can avoid that will cause harm to your employees.&nbsp;&ldquo;I created my own policy, and so far, we have a good working synergy and the team has been safe so far.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to Agnes, her catering business makes it easier for her to follow the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.&nbsp;Said Agnes: &ldquo;I understand that employees need to be healthy and safe, so I monitor my workers.&nbsp;&ldquo;The advantage is that I have a small team, which allows me to know each and everyone in the team.&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also learnt that education was a useful aid, so I get qualified people to come in now and again to educate my employees about the important subject of hygiene.&rdquo; Spokesperson Tebogo Thebajana said the Labour Department celebrated the day by educating employers about safety and health at the workplace &ndash; for both big and small companies.&nbsp;The celebration was in line with Section 8 Act in the Constitution, stating that both employers and employees need to be safe at the workplace.&nbsp;&ldquo;Employers need to ensure they maintain a safe and healthy environment. There should be reps appointed by the company. Represantatives will also ensure injuries and diseases are avoided by informing other employees about safety precautions,&rdquo; Tebogo said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Representatives also need to ensure that when there&rsquo;s fire, they help employees to remain calm. This really helps in terms of avoiding panic attacks in an emergency.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to Tebogo, there were emergency incidents that often occurred.&nbsp;Some companies had fire drills performed once in a while, to prepare employees when and if the building caught fire.&nbsp;There were also emergency exists to help employees escape and remain safe.&nbsp;
