SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter conceded his side were 'outclassed' and showed 'a lack of character and quality' in their 5-0 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns.The Brazilians took a 3-0 lead within 27 minutes and went on to cruise to victory over a Matsatsantsa team which offered virtually no resistance at Loftus on Thursday night.Having been one of the teams challenging strongly at the top of the table in recent months, the result was a major setback to the Tshwane club and sees them now eight points off the summit.Baxter offered no excuses for the defeat and was upset at the nature in which his team capitulated."If you turn the ball over to a quality team like we did tonight, they are going to punish you. I have lost by five twice in my career &ndash; once to Barcelona and once tonight," he said after the game."We played kamikaze for 15-20 minutes and we couldn&rsquo;t play properly. We allowed them to play through our lines, we defended badly and they ran in behind us time after time."Once you are 4-0 down at halftime, you are looking to stop the bleeding," Baxter continued. "Looking to try and scrape your way back into the game. But if you look at the whole game, we were just outclassed, it's as simple as that."We showed a lack of character and quality to follow a game-plan, in our individual technical ability we didn't show what we could do. It looked like we were watching and admiring Sundowns rather than being in the game."Baxter, who is strongly linked to the Bafana Bafana job, must lead his side into battle on Sunday &nbsp;in a second leg Confederation Cup play-off match at home to Liberian side Barrack Young Controllers, before again facing Sundowns in the league next week.
