THAMI Mkhatshwa loved his mum Thema Sibiti (50) very much and always told her that one day he would lift her from misery and poverty.But then he was knocked over by a car in 2013 and Thami changed. On Sunday morning, the adoring son allegedly sank a pair of grass shears into his mum&rsquo;s heart! Thema died instantly.According to his aunt Lydia Sibiti, he cried bitterly and begged her to come and take him to the cops.Hardworking Thami (26), of Mdladla Village near Malelane in Mpumalanga, is now in jail. Lydia told Daily Sun she was at church when Thami called her. &ldquo;I rushed to the house and found him sitting next to my sister&rsquo;s body in his bedroom. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what I was seeing. Thami and his mum were the best of friends. For years all he ever dreamt about was taking his mother out of poverty. He had just found his calling as a welder, and was doing well.&rdquo;By the time cops arrived at the scene, Thami had allegedly forgotten what had happened or even making the call to his aunt. He told his aunt and cops that he could not have harmed his mother, as all he has ever done was for her.Lydia said her nephew&rsquo;s mental state began to change after the accident. She said now and then Thema would call and complain that Thami had become violent and was hallucinating.Lieutenant Mzwandile Nyambi said a 26-year-old man was arrested on a murder charge. &ldquo;He appeared in court on Tuesday and the case was postponed to Monday for further investigation.&rdquo;
