DJ OSKIDO has proved that he wasn&rsquo;t a member of Brothers of Peace for nothing. On Monday night the popular musician managed to make peace between feuding sports presenter Robert Marawa and former minister of sport, Fikile Mbalula. Oskido said although he got his friends to meet and iron out their differences, he was no hero. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take credit for it. I acted as a concerned friend for both of them. I&rsquo;m in no way a champion but I&rsquo;m glad the air has been cleared,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun. Following the meeting between the two men, Oskido happily announced on his Instagram page yesterday that they had made peace.&ldquo;We had coffee and spoke everything through,&rdquo; said Oskido. The feud, which first started over comments made on Marawa&rsquo;s Metro FM show in 2015 blaming Mbalula for the slow pace of transformation in rugby, really heated up earlier this year when the two fought on Twitter over the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Marawa said he had no confidence in the sports ministry to host the event and Mbalula did not take kindly to that. Soon the two were exchanging insults and accusations on social media. The drama continued when Mbalula&rsquo;s legal team served Marawa with a letter demanding he apologise to the minister. Mbalula yesterday told the People&rsquo;s Paper the fight was in the past. &ldquo;Robert has never been my enemy. We sat down and spoke about all our issues and I&rsquo;m happy with everything,&rdquo; he said.Marawa didn&rsquo;t respond to calls or SMSes sent to him.
