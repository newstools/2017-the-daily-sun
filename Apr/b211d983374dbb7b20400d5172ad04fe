Dear MizzB I am 19 years old and have a matric certificate, but I&rsquo;m not sure which career to pursue.I am passionate about helping poor people, but my matric results don&rsquo;t allow me to go to university. What can I do as I do not want to feel like I wasted my parents&rsquo; money after they sent me to school for 12 years.-&nbsp; ConfusedDear ConfusedYour success is in your hands.As people, we each have different destinations and this means we cannot travel the same road. What if your route is not the usual one that everyone else has taken? As someone who loves helping others, have you thought about volunteering your services at non-profit organisations? I think this may steer you in the direction you should be in.Do not be pressured by other people&rsquo;s success, because every tree grows at its own pace. Some trees grow faster than others, but what is important is that they all eventually bear fruit. Please don&rsquo;t give up on life.
