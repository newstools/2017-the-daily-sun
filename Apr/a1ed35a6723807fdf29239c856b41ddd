THE news shocked the nation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Julius loses wife and child . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;BUT IT WAS A CRUEL HOAX!&nbsp;Yesterday, Mzansi woke up to the news that EFF Commander-in-Chief (CIC) Julius Malema had lost his wife and son in a fatal car accident in Sandton, Jozi.&nbsp;But it was just a big fat lie!&nbsp;According to the fake online report, Mantwa Matlala and her seven-month-old son Munzhedzi were travelling in a Jeep.&nbsp;It reportedly clipped the rear of a tipper truck, hit a barrier and rolled. The report alleged the two were certified dead at the scene.&nbsp;EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu was quick to dismiss the hoax, saying: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know who created that, and for what &ndash; but it&rsquo;s all lies.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sources inside the party said the fake news item was planted to destabilise the EFF.&nbsp;It came two days after the EFF had joined opposition parties to stage a powerful anti-Zuma march.&nbsp;An EFF figure, who is known to Sunday Sun , said: &ldquo;We know there are many people, especially from other political parties, who don&rsquo;t love our CIC and wish he could disappear.&nbsp;&ldquo;But we are not even shaken by the fake news. Julius Malema is here to stay. Only God knows his lifespan.&rdquo;&nbsp;Malema referred all inquiries to the EFF statement, which was released by the national spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi.&nbsp;In the statement, Ndlozi said: &ldquo;The report on the fake news website, Global News, that the CIC&rsquo;s family had been involved in a car accident was fake. We would like to reiterate categorically that the CIC&rsquo;s family is safe and enjoying the Easter weekend in peace.&nbsp;&ldquo;We encourage all people to reject the website of Global News (www.glonews360.com) as a fake news site that should never be trusted or relied on for genuine news.&rdquo;&nbsp;Sunday Sun sources claimed Malema was one of the top politicians scheduled to appear today at the ZCC headquarters in Moria, Limpopo. But neither Shivambu nor Ndlozi confirmed the claim.&nbsp;
