NATIONAL Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete yesterday avoided commenting on the recent Cabinet reshuffle. Mbete, who had to cut a trip to Bangladesh short, addressed the media at OR Tambo International Airport in Ekurhuleni. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comment on things that happened in my absence,&rdquo; she said when asked about the controversial axing of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan. One of the reasons she cut her trip short was to deal with applications by opposition parties for a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma. The EFF has also filed papers at the Constitutional Court to try and force the Speaker to impeach him. The DA last week approached the High Court to halt the swearing in of new ministers but the bid was rejected. Mbete was in Bangladesh to lead a delegation to the Assembly of the International Parliamentary Unions. She told reporters: &ldquo;I had to cut my participation short in light of recent developments, which have thrust the constitutional role of parliament to the fore. &ldquo;These include myself being cited as a respondent in the matter between the official opposition and the president in the Western Cape High Court, in which the opposition sought to interdict the swearing in of new members of the executive.&rdquo; She said the process of consultation in consideration of the requests would start today. &ldquo;I imagine the consultation should be concluded as soon as possible.&rdquo; She needs to consult the chief whip of the majority&nbsp;party, and deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. Mbete said once the consultation process was completed her office would write to all parties to advise them of the outcome.
