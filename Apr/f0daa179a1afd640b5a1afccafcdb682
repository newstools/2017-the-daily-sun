ZAMA Nkosi can&rsquo;t face going to school anymore because she can&rsquo;t handle being called names by the other children.Her gogo Thoko Xulu (55) from KwaHlabisa in northern KZN told Daily Sun Zama (10) has been to four different schools to try and get away from kids who make fun of her.&ldquo;Zama was injured when she was three months old,&rdquo; said gogo Thoko.&ldquo;A gas stove burst in the house while she and her mother were visiting our neighbour in 2007.&rdquo;Zama&rsquo;s mother died in the accident, but the baby survived after spending six months in hospital.Gogo said the child&rsquo;s mother never told her who Zama&rsquo;s father was.&ldquo;All I need right now is to see Zama happy. &ldquo;She is a clever child, but the kids who make fun of her really hurt her.&rdquo;She said even the teachers at school said they were tired of Zama reporting the other children to them.&ldquo;We have taken her to four different schools. She has been made fun of at all the schools.&rdquo; She said Zama did not want to go back to school.&ldquo;If only she could get surgery done. Perhaps she will be happier. She would look like other kids and not feel like the odd one out.&rdquo; Gogo Thoko said she was worried that if she died, the child might end up taking her own life.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m appealing to the department of health or anyone else to please help her.&rdquo; The department of health&rsquo;s Agiza Hlongwane said Zama&rsquo;s gogo should go to the KwaHlabisa Hospital so that an assessment can be done on Zama.Kwazi Mthethwa, the KZN Education department spokesman, said teachers should not allow other kids to mock a child in class.&ldquo;Zama&rsquo;s gogo can contact the department so that she can be taken in for counselling,&rdquo; said Mthethwa. Belinda Long, general manager of the Smile Foundation, said they don&rsquo;t have offices in KZN &ndash; but she asked for the contact details of Zama&rsquo;s family and said she would follow up on the matter. &ldquo;I will be able to respond next week after I have contacted the family.&rdquo;
