HE COULD easily be mistaken for a madman . . . But Lutendo &ldquo;Mgijimi the King&rdquo; Ndou entertains people in the village.The 29-year-old man from Lwamondo Village, near Thohoyandou, Limpopo said he was inspired by Mgijimi on Isibaya. &ldquo;When I saw Mgijimi, I started painting myself with clay and wore torn clothes just to look like him,&rdquo; he told Daily Sun.&ldquo;This has helped me a lot because my music is now selling like hot cakes.&rdquo; Last Monday, the SunTeam saw him performing for shoppers outside Elim mall.He was performing songs from his debut album titled Calvary, which was released last year. &ldquo;I have many fans in the village, and some people follow me around to watch my performances,&rdquo; said Lutendo.He sings mostly gospel music and says he was inspired by the late gospel artist, Oleseng Shuping. &ldquo;Oleseng had a great voice and his music was the best. &ldquo;I believe God is truly working through me because whenever I perform, my music tends to heal broken souls.&rdquo;Lutendo said the Mgijimi look has played a huge role in his success. &ldquo;The look makes me unique from other artists,&rdquo; he told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;I can relate to the character because it is about a person who is struggling and lives on the streets.&ldquo;Mgijimi depends on others to survive and can go for days without bathing.&rdquo;He said that he was grateful to the villagers for always supporting him.&ldquo;I am so humbled by the support I get from my fellows in the village,&rdquo; Lutendo told Daily Sun.
