THE THUG thought a woman alone in her house was an easy target, but he got it badly wrong.&nbsp; When he tried to attack, the brave woman hit him with a meat tenderiser.&nbsp; THEN SHE HIT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!&nbsp; MBALI Makhubo&rsquo;s ordeal started at about 10.30pm on Thursday night. A thug bent back the burglar bars on a window of her house in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni and tried to get in through the window. When 35-year-old Mbali woke up and saw the man at the window she jumped out of bed and hit him. He fell back and she thought it was over. But it wasn&rsquo;t. An hour later the stubborn thug was back! When Mbali saw the armed, half-naked man coming in through the window, she ran to the kitchen.&nbsp; The first weapon she could lay her hands on was a meat tenderising hammer. She ran back to the bedroom and hit the man on the head. And although he was already bleeding, he continued to force his way into the room. Whether he was there to rape her or rob her isn&rsquo;t clear, but brave Mbali would not let him have his way!&nbsp; A blood trail tells the story of how Mbali chased him around the house. There was blood on the television, kitchen appliances and in the bedroom. Couches and carpets were splattered too. Everything in the bedroom was turned upside-down as the two fought. She got hold of the man&rsquo;s finger and bit him hard. Mbali managed to switch on her phone and phone her dad, Velaphi Makhubo.&nbsp; Mbali&rsquo;s dad phoned a neighbour and asked him to help her. &ldquo;I could hear the man screaming as Mbali was begging for help over the phone,&rdquo; said Velaphi. The neighbour came to help Mbali and the thug was caught and tied up.&nbsp; The cops were called and he was arrested&nbsp; Mbali was too traumatised to speak to the People&rsquo;s Paper.&nbsp; Her father said they knew the man from the neighbourhood. &ldquo;He knew Mbali very well,&rdquo; said Velaphi.He said it was the third time the thug had broken into their house. &ldquo;He also stole a car battery and cellphones. The court must not be kind to him. My daughter could have died,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mbali is even thinking of moving. We are grateful she is safe because the suspect could have killed and raped her, as he was armed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The suspect (27) appeared in the Daveyton Magistrates Court on Monday for assault and housebreaking.&nbsp; He will make his second appearance next week.&nbsp;
