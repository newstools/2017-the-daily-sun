POLICE ministry spokesman Vuyo Mhaga yesterday confirmed that former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza has returned the state car he took on Monday. Mhaga told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Yes, Ntlemeza returned it during the course of the day. As far as his cellphone is concerned, I&rsquo;m not sure about that. &ldquo;Normally, a cellphone is seen as a tool of trade and would be kept until that employee&rsquo;s contract is terminated.&rdquo; Ntlemeza was ordered to return all police property in his possession by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, or face arrest. During a media briefing on Monday, the minister said it was unlawful for Ntlemeza to have entered the police premises and acted as if he was still in charge. The former Hawks boss reported for duty on Monday, despite being warned by the minister not to do so. Mbalula said Ntlemeza was not allowed to exercise any duties afforded to the head of the Hawks unless the Supreme Court of Appeal reversed the ruling nullifying his appointment. Ntlemeza&rsquo;s lawyer, Comfort Ngidi, said what happened on Monday was an insult to justice. He said he would be filing an urgent interdict to force the minister to stop interfering with his client&rsquo;s right to work and claimed the minister was badly advised. He said they respected Mbalula&rsquo;s order that Ntlemeza should return the car, but it was a bit tricky to return his cellphone because as a professional policeman he had to clean it before handing it over. Following the minister&rsquo;s order for Ntlemeza to return his state car, Mbalula got support from unlikely sources, including EFF leader Julius Malema. Malema tweeted: &ldquo;South Africans, please help locate this crook. He is in possession of a state vehicle and cellphone without authorisation.&rdquo;
