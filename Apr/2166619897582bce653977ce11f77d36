ACTRESS Terry Pheto&rsquo;s latest movie, Kalushi, is allegedly failing to crack it on the big screen.&nbsp;Hardly a month after Kalushi premiered on the big screen, Sunday Sun has been told the movie has not attracted viewers and the cinema is considering taking it off the big screen.&nbsp;&ldquo;The cinema is looking at ways to take it to townships,&rdquo; said one source.&nbsp;Sunday Sun has learnt the movie is not doing well and most actors are complaining.&nbsp;Several sources say the movie is not a crowd-puller.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost a month since it&rsquo;s been on circuit, but sales are not moving up,&rdquo; said one source.&nbsp;Lead actor, Thabo Rametsie, took his Twitter page to complain that the movie was not accessible to black people.&nbsp;Some of the stars in the movie, such as Pearl Thusi, have been rallying people to go and watch the movie.&nbsp;But according to sources, the movie could be taken off several cinema houses if it doesn&rsquo;t make it to the five highest grossing movies.&nbsp;Sunday Sun has learnt that the director and some actors pleaded with the minister of arts and culture to help them promote the movie.&nbsp;Speaking to the director of the movie, Mandla Dube, he said they were planning to take the movie to the people.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing called black cinema, but we&rsquo;re going to make a plan. There are mobile cinemas, which is another way to make people watch the movie,&rdquo; Mandla said.&nbsp;Thabo, who is passionate about pushing this movie as far as it can go, said he had attempted to raise some issues with the distributors of Kalushi.&nbsp;He said he &ldquo;got into trouble&rdquo; when he raised geographical distribution issues of the movie.&nbsp;Instead, the young film star urged his followers who can&rsquo;t access Kalushi in their areas or can&rsquo;t afford high cinema prices, to please tweet. And said &ldquo;the gatekeepers need to see this&rdquo;.&nbsp;
