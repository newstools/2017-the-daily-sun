AS HIS star keeps rising, Dumza simply says: &ldquo;Life is good. Yeah, life is really good to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;The singer and composer from the Eastern Cape told SunBuzz he did not regret how life channelled him into music, rather than what was his first love &ndash; radio.In his booming, coarse voice, which is in contrast to his singing, he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember a time when I didn&rsquo;t love music. Growing up around this place, I was always surrounded by music. From boys coming back from initiation school, weddings, funerals, churches to general functions in the villages.&rdquo;He said the other influence was his mineworker neighbour, who used to come back with CDs of artists such as Dolly Parton, Clarence Carter, Marvin Gaye and The O&rsquo;Jays.&nbsp;Dumza, real name Dumisani Maswana, said he would spend hours at his neighbour&rsquo;s house and emulate these singers.Although he&rsquo;s from the younger generation of musicians, the 34-year-old didn&rsquo;t choose the somewhat same genres as his peers.His music is difficult to box into a specific genre, but it&rsquo;s soulful with a tinge of jazz and world music.He said there was a time when he got very worried about his changing voice.&ldquo;Up until when I was 14 years old, I had the tiniest voice around and I could sing like Dolly Parton and other singers.&ldquo;At 16 years, my beautiful voice started changing and I thought I&rsquo;d lost my magic. I was getting distressed.&ldquo;People who knew about my singing abilities encouraged and told me I didn&rsquo;t always need a small voice to sing.&ldquo;They told me musicians like Barry White and others with bigger voices had become greats in music,&rdquo; he said.Dumza, whose songs are all self-composed, said his musical career was shaped by listening to giants like Victor Ntoni, Victor Ndlazilwane, Zim Ngqawane and other Mzansi jazz legends.It&rsquo;s not surprising his two albums, Iphupha Lam (2010) and the recent release Molo (2016), have done so well.He said: &ldquo;My single, Nomthandazo, opened many closed doors for me. It also set the tone for my latest CD. I love to write about things that happen in everyday life and about ordinary people.&rdquo;Nomthandazo is presently listed on 17 radio stations.On 29 April, Dumza will be performing at Winnie&rsquo;s Jazz and Soul Restaurant in the north of Joburg.He is also excited that on 17 June he will be honoured to share the stage with legends the likes of Caiphus Semenya, Hugh Masekela and Bhudaza Mapefane.
