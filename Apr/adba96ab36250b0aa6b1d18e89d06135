AS HE turned into the Wanderers taxi rank in Joburg in his patrol car, the taxi boss stopped to buy a loose draw. But he never got to smoke it . . . He was shot and killed in front of passersby and passengers! The taxi owner, who belonged to the Joburg, Benoni, Brakpan, Springs, Secunda and Witbank Taxi Association, died instantly.The vendor who sold him the cigarette said he was lucky to have escaped uninjured . . . &ldquo;Those people were shooting to kill. They wanted everything dead,&rdquo; he said.Other witnesses said the shooting incident took place in the afternoon while people were going about their business. &ldquo;Out of the blue we heard gunshots,&rdquo; said a commuter. &ldquo;The people ran for cover, fearing for their lives. Vendors hid under their tables.&rdquo;The incident is believed to be linked to ongoing taxi violence, although SAPS provincial spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele told the SunTeam they had not established the motive for the shooting.&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t connect the incident to taxi violence,&rdquo; he said. Makhubele said police were investigating a case of murder, and no one had been arrested.Taxi owners and drivers told Daily Sun they feared for their lives.&ldquo;This is not the first incident to happen right here at the taxi rank&rsquo;s entrance,&rdquo; said a taxi driver.&ldquo;Nobody has been arrested for the previous incident. There are cameras here. What are they for?&rdquo;Daily Sun&rsquo;s attempts to get hold of the association were fruitless.
