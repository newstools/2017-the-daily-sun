FINALLY, taxi bosses have come together to apologise.&ldquo;We are sorry,&rdquo; said the taximen whose associations have been at the centre of the taxi wars on the R61 route between Mthatha and Port St Johns.MEC Weziwe Tikana of Transport, Safety and Liaison finally got taxi bosses from the Border Taxi Association and Uncedo Services to apologise to the families of the 30 people killed in violence, and to passengers whose lives have been affected.A special evening prayer service was held at Rotary Stadium in Mthatha on Sunday to coincide with the launch of the Easter safety campaign.Thirty white candles were lit to bring peace and to remember the taxi owners, drivers and passengers who have died in the turf war.Uncedo&rsquo;s Bishop Zola Yolelo and Border&rsquo;s chairman Thandekile Skomela helped light the candles with MEC Tikana.They said they had resolved their issues and apologised to the families and their passengers.Last Thursday Tikana met the two rival associations and said she would reopen the three hot spot taxi ranks in Mthatha, Ntlaza and Port St Johns if they agreed to a ceasefire.Preparing for this weekend, Tikana said last December, accidents on the road went down by 20%, and said she hoped for a repeat this Easter. &ldquo;It is sad to see so many accidents on the road. But that is all going to change.&rdquo;Before the prayers, the MEC and other government officials had a massive gathering on the R61 between Mthatha and Libode, where she issued a warning.&ldquo;If drivers do not abide by the rules of road they will face the law.&rdquo; So far the associations have not signed the memorandum of understanding they previously agreed on, asking for time to consult their members.
