FOR the first time in years the Tshwane derby between Mamelodi Sundowns and SuperSport United will be fiercely contested for a number of reasons. This derby has a different feel to it and it&rsquo;s a match neither club can afford to lose. When the Brazilians host their bitter rivals at Loftus Versfeld tonight (6pm), the spotlight will also fall on the two coaches, Pitso Mosimane and Stuart Baxter, who both happen to be ex-Bafana Bafana coaches. Things are falling apart for Mosimane and his troops, and defeat to their cross-town rivals will see them in serious trouble. Downs have not won in six matches in all competitions. Matsatsantsa a Pitori coach Baxter is rumoured to be on his way to Bafana Bafana at the end of the season and these reports appeared to have rattled his players as they bid to win the league title. SuperSport lost their previous league game 1-0 to relegation-haunted Baroka FC 1-0, an indication that players may not be taking the news of Baxter&rsquo;s possible departure well. Downs completed the double over Matsatsantsa last season, but things are not looking good right now. In their last 32 meetings, Sundowns have won 17 times losing nine matches and drawing six, and they will look to the stats for motivation. The Brazilians are off form and goals have dried up as they look for ways to recover from their slump. Defeat for SuperSport will see them lose ground on the leaders at the top of the table. There is also bragging rights at stake &ndash; the match is not just about the three points on offer. SuperSport skipper Dean Furman said the decision to leave the club was entirely up to Baxter: &ldquo;We have our own expectations &ndash; we want to win the league. We are professionals and will not allow the news about the coach to distract us from our goal.&rdquo; Brazilians talisman Khama Billiat said they had to bounce back in the derby and that losing was not an option.
