SAVE SA hosted a gathering at Church Square in Tshwane, followed by a protest outside the Treasury offices yesterday. The protest started on Friday and protesters have promised to protest outside Treasury for the entire week. Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota and former Cosatu secretary-general Zwelinzima Vavi attended the gathering. The gathering took place on the same day as Black Monday, which called for people in Mzansi to wear black to protest against President Jacob Zuma and the Cabinet reshuffle.Vavi said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want Treasury to be the next SABC, Eskom or SAA. But if we fold our arms and do nothing, it will go that way.&rdquo; Lekota said they were there because the ANC had given power to an individual who has no respect for the Constitution. When asked about newly appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, Lekota said: &ldquo;His actions will prove whether or not he has been captured.&rdquo;He said the minsters who were removed had done nothing wrong.&ldquo;They expressed opinions the president didn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;Save SA convener Sipho Pityana said Gigaba has failed in his previous portfolios and will fail again. &ldquo;We are going nowhere until Zuma and Gigaba resign. We will not let them and their friends loot Treasury.&rdquo;
