SIS RIBS taught me everything there is to know about the music industry.These are the words of gospel artist Zaza, who recently launched her own record label, Zahza Holdings.&ldquo;Zaza&rdquo;, real name, Zanele Mokhethi (34) from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, also recently launched her first DVD, titled Blowing The Horn Of Chronicle.Zaza is not new in the music circles, as she has been a backing vocalist for artists such as Rebecca Malope, Andile kaMajola and Kekeletso Phofoolo.Speaking to SunBuzz, Zaza said she&rsquo;s learnt a lot from Rebecca.&ldquo;Sis Ribs taught me to be a businesswoman while being a singer. She taught me how to interact with people that I work with.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why today I&rsquo;m running my own recording company, along with my husband.&ldquo;I want to show up-and-coming artists that they can be independent and owners of their companies.&rdquo;The singer has four albums under her belt, and her last offering was Imvuselelo, which was released in 2014.She added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through the worst. I&rsquo;ve been screwed over and made to sign contracts out of excitement.&ldquo;I had to learn the hard way that signing a contract without understanding its terms and conditions may come back to haunt you.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what drove me to open my own recording stable. I use artists from Ekurhuleni to back me. It&rsquo;s part of my initiation to give back,&rdquo; said the rising star.
