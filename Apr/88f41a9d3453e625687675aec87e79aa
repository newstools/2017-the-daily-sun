ZIMBABWEAN sensation Mike Fokoroni hopes to complete back-to-back victories at the Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathon in Cape Town on Saturday.Fokoroni, running in the colours of the Nedbank Running Club, has been camping in Bindura, north of Harare, to prepare for his title defence.The long-distance runner is the favourite to win the 56km event. This after he won the Ultra with a time of 3:13:33 seconds to reign supreme last season. But runners from Kenya and Ethiopia may give him a run for his money.Commenting about his &ldquo;best athlete&rdquo; Fokoroni, Nedbank Running Club manager Nick Bester said: &ldquo;He is super-ready and can&rsquo;t wait to get started. He will be here in Pretoria, Gauteng, tomorrow morning to put on the finishing touches.&ldquo;Mike is in the best condition and is looking forward to the Ultra.&rdquo;meanwhile, His training partner, Limpopo-born Ludwick Mamabolo, carries the hopes of local male runners.The sponsors have dangled a carrot of R1&thinsp;million for the male and female athletes who break the course record set by Thompson Magawana and Frith van der Merwe. Magawana broke the men&rsquo;s record in 1988 (3:03:44), and Van der Merwe the women&rsquo;s in 1989 (3:30:36).Mzansi&rsquo;s long-distance star, Caroline Wostmann, who won the race in 3:44:44 last year, was tipped to repeat her feat this season.The former Comrades ladies winner is going into this year&rsquo;s Easter weekend race confident after defending her 50km Om Die Dam Marathon in the North West three weeks ago.Said Wostmann: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m preparing for the Comrades marathon, but I hope to go all the way and defend my title. It&rsquo;s not going to be easy, but I will do my best.&rdquo;Comrades champion Charne Bosman is expected to push Wostmann, as the two ladies renew their rivalry in the Mother City. Bosman finished fourth at the Two Oceans last year.&nbsp;
