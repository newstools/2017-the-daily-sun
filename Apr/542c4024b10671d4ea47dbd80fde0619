THE DA in KZN has opened a case of assault against the ANC Youth League. The party also opened a case of incitement against eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede after the anti-Zuma march to demand the resignation of President Jacob Zuma on Friday. Members of the youth league allegedly assaulted a member of the DA who was on his way home. He was wearing the party T-shirt when he was assaulted. DA KZN leader Zwakele Mncwango and other leaders accompanied the man to Durban Central Police Station on Saturday morning to open a case of assault against the league.Mcwango told Daily Sun they opened two cases. &ldquo;The victim opened a case of assault. The DA opened a case of incitement against eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede as we believe the mayor incited this kind of violence,&rdquo; said Mcwango.&ldquo;She said there will be consequences. We also heard Thanduxolo Sabela saying they did what they did because they were protecting Zuma. The mayor and Thanduxolo must account.&rdquo; Sabela, the KZN ANCYL secretary, said they were not aware of the assault. &ldquo;The DA provoked us by marching against our president. We were defending our president. If they marched against him, they are touching us,&rdquo; he said.The mayor&rsquo;s spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede, said: &ldquo;We note the case lodged by the DA and we view it as a publicity stunt because it only comes after they failed to mobilise any numbers.&rdquo; KZN police spokeswoman captain Nqobile Gwala said: &ldquo;Charges of incitement to commit public violence and an illegal march are being investigated. Investigations are continuing.&rdquo;
