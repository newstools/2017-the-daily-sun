ALL LECTURES have been suspended at the Mangosuthu University of Technology. This comes after students at the university in Umlazi, south of Durban, started protesting on Wednesday over the late payment of allowances by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. Police had to use teargas and stun grenades to disperse about 5 000 protesting students on Wednesday.They gathered near the Griffiths Mxenge Highway and started throwing stones at the cops and passing cars. A first-year marketing management student (19) said they were tired of waiting for their textbook allowance. &ldquo;We were supposed to get this money right after registration, but we are still waiting&rdquo; said the student. A 22-year-old public management student said they were also angry about their food allowance. &ldquo;We need this money to buy groceries, but we have not received anything,&rdquo; said the student. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nq-obile Gwala said no arrests were made.NSFAS spokesman Kagisho Mamabolo said the scheme had made a payment of R1,3 billion for registration and allowances to all universities on 16 January. &ldquo;At this point the university is handling the payment of allowances and has already used the payment for registration deposits, accommodation, books, meals and travel allowances,&rdquo; he said. He said the university's financial aid committee would meet soon to decide on allowances for the rest of the year. University spokesman Bheki Hlophe said classes would be suspended until Wednesday.
