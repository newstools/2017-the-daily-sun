OLYMPIC 400m gold medallist and record holder Wayde &ldquo;Dreamer&rdquo; van Niekerk&rsquo;s coach, Ans Botha, is confident Mzansi&rsquo;s golden boy will complete a historic double at the IAAF World Championships in London, England, in August.&nbsp;The 75-year-old South African Sports Coach of the Year winner last year says nothing is impossible with Wayde.But the Namibian-born coach is worried that fatigue and injury could halt the newly-crowned local 200m champion&rsquo;s dream season.Botha, who coached Dreamer to a 43.03-second record at the Olympic Games in the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, said her star athlete faced a hectic schedule this year.Van Niekerk smashed US icon Michael Johnson&rsquo;s&nbsp;17-year record in Brazil to secure his first Olympic gold medal.This year, he will do the double at the world champs in the 200m and 400m events.Last week, the 24-year-old speedster broke the local senior track and field record in the 200m sprint, when he ran 19.90 seconds in Potchefstroom, North West.Van Niekerk also competed in the 100m final, clocking 10.04 seconds to finish second behind Akani Simbine (9.95).Van Niekerk&rsquo;s first competitive race abroad will be in Boston on 4 June, followed by another in Jamaica a week later.He and Simbine will take part in a training camp with world superstar Usain Bolt in Kingston.Said Botha: &ldquo;His body isn&rsquo;t that strong to handle the 100m without endangering him. If he gets injured now, his season is gone. So, we need to manage him carefully.&rdquo;
