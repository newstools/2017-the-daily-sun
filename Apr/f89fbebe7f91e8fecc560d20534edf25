According to data from cheating website Victoria Milan, 47.3% of men internationally have made use of sex workers, and 23.3% are regulars - engaging "ladies of the night" at least once a week.It is pertinent to note that this cannot be extrapolated to men in general, but only of the men who form part of the cheating website's subscribers. &nbsp;The data, compiled from the site's 6 097 male members showed that 35% of men who use sex workers do not enjoy the experience; rather do it out of "necessity".The main reason men pay for sex is the unavailability of a partner - 40.1% of men fell into this category - but 36.% used sex workers to live out fantasies that the they could not with their current long-term partner.In terms of price, Victoria Milan said that men paid an average of &euro;50 - &euro;200 (R710 - R2840) or about &euro;2 000 (R28 398) per year for a regular customer.Inequality and exploitationHowever, there are wild swings in price throughout the world.According to black market pricing index Havocscope, the cost for a sex worker in India can range from $1 (R13) for an adult to $1 000 (R13 000) for a virgin (read: underage girl).However, the rate in Germany is a flat $65 (R858) and a union minimum of $100 (R1321) in Switzerland. In the UK, a street sex worker can cost about $20 (R264).In SA, The Citizen reported that a Johannesburg sex worker makes between R3 000 and R4 000 a month, charging R100 for straight sex.Advocacy group SWEAT estimates that there are between 31 000 and 94 000 sex workers in Gauteng, with the majority being black South African women and a significant percentage from Zimbabwe. A Stellenbosch University Master's thesis by Ferdinand Chemungha Mukumbang suggests that 1.51% of the adult female population in SA are involved in the sex trade. The cheating website found that 80% of men will book a sex worker for one hour to "get it over and done with as quickly as possible".
