ORLANDO Pirates winger Thembinkosi Lorch says they have a plan to boot Free State Stars from the Nedbank Cup.The teams meet in the Last 16 round at the James Motlatsi Stadium in Orkney on Saturday (8.15pm). Bucs will be eager to avenge the 3-2 league defeat to Ea Lla Koto at the same venue last weekend. The speedy player reckons progressing in the competition could spur Bucs on to greater heights in the Absa Premiership. The Soweto giants have been in a slump, dropping crucial points and sliding closer to the relegation zone. Pirates occupy 11th spot in the league table with 23 points from 21 matches. Only five points separate them from bottom club Baroka FC.Said Lorch: &ldquo;Stars are a good team and it&rsquo;s very hard to play against them, especially at their home ground. They are very aggressive. We have to use our strength to win the game and work on our defensive patterns to avoid conceding soft goals. &ldquo;Obviously it won&rsquo;t be easy but we have to go there and play as a unit.&rdquo;Lorch knows they won&rsquo;t get an easy passage at Stars slaughterhouse. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t complain about the pitch. If you play for a PSL team you need to be able to adapt to any situation.&rdquo; The modest Lorch has seen his incredible performances which earned him a couple of Man of the Match accolades overshadowed by poor results.&ldquo;If the team is not doing well, I&rsquo;m not happy. When we win, I can enjoy my personal achievements. He pleaded for patience. &ldquo;Supporters look to me to deliver, so I will put in more effort to help turn our fortunes around. Keep supporting us, things will get better.&rdquo;
