FORMER Boxing SA administrator and current head trainer at East London&rsquo;s All Winners Boxing Gym, Loyiso Mtya, says modern technology has played a vital role in his charge&rsquo;s preparations for their next battle. He trains Zolani &ldquo;Last Born&rdquo; Tete, who is gearing up for the World Boxing Organisation bantamweight title eliminator against Filipino Arthur Villanueva at Leicester Arena in the United Kingdom on Friday.The former middleweight contender says the internet has made things easier for them, as trainers can now spy on opponents over the net. Said Mtya: &ldquo;These days the internet makes things easy, you can&rsquo;t hide anything. All the information you need is right there, any opponent becomes an open book. We know they have been studying us and we have been studying them as well.&ldquo;Things are different to the good old days where you stepped into the ring, having never seen the opponent apart from when you watched him sign the register at the weigh-in. We know our opponent&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, and we&rsquo;re ready for the fight.&rdquo;Speaking to SunSport before they left for England yesterday, Mtya said their focus in the UK would be to keep Tete agile and work on his speed. The contest has been postponed more than once. It was initially scheduled for last November, moved to 8 April and finally to Friday.&ldquo;To Tete this is it!&rdquo; Mtya said. &ldquo;This is the event he has been waiting for since he lost his International Boxing Federation (IBF) title unfairly. It&rsquo;s time to fight for another title.&rdquo; The South African southpaw has registered 24 victories and three defeats, while his counterpart has 31 fights on his record, losing only once to McJoe Arroyo for the IBF super flyweight world title in July 2015.
