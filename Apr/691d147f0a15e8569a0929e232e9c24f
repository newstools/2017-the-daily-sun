APRIL is Health Awareness Month and people have different ways to stay healthy without spending a lot.&nbsp;Growing up in an environment where most people are affected by what they eat, Mpho Thulo (27) struggles to stay healthy.&nbsp;But he&rsquo;s not interested in changing his diet or following a workout routine.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sweating or working hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. But some research I read suggests that all I do now will catch up with me as I grow older,&rdquo; Mpho said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I need to gradually introduce some changes into my life. But then again, I look at exercise as a boring tool. I&rsquo;m adventurous, but my budget doesn&rsquo;t really allow me to go wild.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mpho said he was more interested in a regimen that would keep his body and mind healthy, and one &ldquo;I could enjoy with family without it being a hassle&rdquo;.&nbsp;Mpumelelo Mtintso, owner of Book A Bicycle, refers to his business as a form of mind meditation.&nbsp;Said Mpumelelo: &ldquo;Our aim was to make bicycle riding fun when we started.&nbsp;&ldquo;We saw that people didn&rsquo;t exercise regularly and consumed unhealthy food, so came up with the creative idea of riding a bicycle in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;&ldquo;Orlando, in Soweto, is a busy township, flooded with tourists. This made it easy for us to recruit ordinary citizens.&rdquo;&nbsp;Book A Bicycle also focuses on developing young minds and keeping them active &ndash; so they look forward to another day.&nbsp;In Vosloorus, east of Jozi, there is Bicycle Stokvel. The venture was&nbsp;co-founded by Lesego Konupi (31), a professional trainer.&nbsp;According to Lesego, cycling is the best form of relaxation.&nbsp;&ldquo;Cycling is an opportunity to be lost in your own world, that&rsquo;s where you get a chance to appreciate your surroundings,&rdquo; Lesego said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Unlike driving, where your awareness is essential, cycling liberates you to indulge in the surroundings.&rdquo;&nbsp;People who cycle often claim the activity challenges and pushes them to go the extra mile.&nbsp;Lesego compared a bicycle with a treadmill.&nbsp;He said it rejuvenated the whole body and increased ones adrenalin rush.&nbsp;&ldquo;You forget about issues, which strain your mind. People generally also use the activity as time to themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp;The whole idea of Bicycle Stokvel was to bring something new and fresh to Vosloorus.&nbsp;It also aimed to teach kids about the history of the township, through cycling around the township, and sharing monumental events that occurred in a specific area.&nbsp;
