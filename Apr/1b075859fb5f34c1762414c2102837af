TANKISO Mohapi says he&rsquo;s lucky to be alive.The 31-year-old from Vereeniging, in the Vaal, claims he was beaten last Wednesday by his landlord and locked in a storeroom while unconscious. &ldquo;I demand justice. This man nearly killed me,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;He brutally assaulted me until I passed out. When he thought I was dead, he dumped me in the Vaal River. I was found by security guards who rescued me.&rdquo; Tankiso said his landlord accused him of being drunk and making too much noise. &ldquo;He was the one who was drunk. I was not even drinking because I was with my girlfriend. He told me it was his yard and I should abide by his rules.&rdquo;He added that he tried to explain that he was not drunk but the man punched and head-butted him several times, cracking open his head. &ldquo;His son joined in and started to hit me on the head with the butt of his gun,&rdquo; he claimed. &ldquo;I lost consciousness after that.&rdquo;Daily Sun contacted the landlord, Coen van der Westhuizen who said Tankiso was accusing him falsely.&ldquo;He is the one who assaulted me and hit me on the head. He was drunk and beating up his girlfriend.&ldquo;She ran into my house for safety,&rdquo; said Coen. &ldquo;He forced his way into the house, ransacking the place and started fighting with everybody. &ldquo;He even kicked me in my private parts!&rdquo; Vereeniging police spokesman Captain Fikile Fundi said an assault case was opened by Mohapi against Coen. He was arrested and is out on bail. No case was opened against the son.
