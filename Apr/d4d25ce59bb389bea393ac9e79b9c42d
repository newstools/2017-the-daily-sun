ONLOOKERS were amazed when they watched Sineko &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; Maneli pick up a 50kg bag of cement with his teeth on Friday. People cheered the 54-year-old as he performed amazing stunts with his teeth of steel at Uitenhage Mall, where he often performs for shoppers. After his first show of strength, he shouted: &ldquo;All I need to do it again is R20!&rdquo; Sineko, who comes from Despatch in Nelson Mandela Bay, said people would remember him. &ldquo;My work will one day be recognised.&rdquo;Sineko pointed out that comedians made a lot of money just by making people laugh. &ldquo;Yet, I&rsquo;m doing an extreme job and get peanuts. Some people call what I do magic while others say I use muthi.&ldquo;But I am neither a sangoma nor a magician. If you don&rsquo;t believe me bring your sons and daughters. I will lift them with my teeth while you watch.&rdquo; Sineko said he sometimes loses teeth when he lifts heavy objects. &ldquo;I used to have 32 teeth but now I only have 19. &ldquo;I lose them during training. I need someone to sponsor me so I can triumph with this work.&rdquo;
