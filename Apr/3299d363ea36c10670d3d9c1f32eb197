SAVE SA says it has not been granted permission to march to the Union Buildings tomorrow and will be petitioning the court later tonight.Save SA spokesperson Mark Heywood said the organisation was denied permission because they had not received authorisation from police in the presidency to march on the lawns of Union Buildings."We wrote to the presidency two days ago requesting permission and have not even had our letter acknowledged. We sent that letter several times."Heywood said Save SA was told they also needed authorisation from the Chief Magistrate because of their proximity to the Palace of Justice.Heywood said that this was a technicality because Save SA had been camped near the Palace of Justice for days."We have been at Church Square in the proximity for days now. Why is this suddenly an issue?"Meanwhile Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga has since tweeted: "We haven't denied permission for tomorrow's march. Someone who's ill-disciplined is busy playing politics using their admin position."More on this story to follow.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/save-sa-to-petition-court-claims-permission-for-march-denied-20170406
