AFTER months of silence, former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng today held a press conference with a bang.For about an hour before he spoke, his supporters &ndash; mainly musicians happy with his 90% local content policy &ndash; sang, danced and defended their icon.When Motsoeneng finally took the microphone, he started by &ldquo;repeating something I&rsquo;ve said many, many times before: you&rsquo;ve got only one Hlaudi!&rdquo; he said, indicating with his hands that he was addressing all the people of Mzansi.Motsoeneng, who started at the SABC as a freelancer in the 1990s, has been a controversial figure at the SABC since his rise to position of chief operating officer (COO) in 2011. In 2014 Public Protector Thuli Madonsela published a damning report after an investigation into governance issues at the SABC. The report revealed that Motsoeneng had lied about having a matric qualification, abused his position by giving himself three salary increases in a year, and purged the SABC of senior staff.His appointment as COO became a matter for the courts, and in 2015 was found to be &ldquo;irrational and illegal&rdquo;. However, an SABC internal disciplinary hearing cleared Motsoeneng, and in 2016 he was appointed to another senior position. He is currently suspended and been told to &ldquo;sit at home&rdquo; while he waits for a second disciplinary hearing. He said he was &ldquo;enjoying life, spending time with my family, cracking some jokes&rdquo; while he waited.Motsoeneng insisted that he is looking forward to his new hearing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to enjoy myself in the disciplinary hearing... There&rsquo;s nothing wrong that I&rsquo;ve done...It&rsquo;s going to be the beginning of Hlaudi.&rdquo;He also said that both Madonsela&rsquo;s report and the resolutions taken by the Parliamentary committee that investigated the SABC board in October last year would make no difference to his fortunes.Among his plans appear to be an intention to run for president, which Motsoeneng suggested would be a easy to achieve. However, he said he would wait because he believed the next president of South Africa must be a woman.Motsoeneng had a full go at Krish Naidoo. Naidoo, who had served on the previous board, resigned in front of the Parliamentary inquiry. He went on to give damning evidence against Hlaudi&rsquo;s gung-ho approach to governance. The Parliamentary committee then appointed him as a member of the new SABC board.Motsoeneng said: &ldquo;Krish Naidoo lied under oath to Parliament... He should be investigated ... We can&rsquo;t have Krish Naidoo on the SABC board when he works for Luthuli House... Krish Naidoo is not credible.&rdquo;His supporters in the audience cried out &ldquo;thief&rdquo; and &ldquo;sellout&rdquo; in support of Motsoeneng&rsquo;s take on Naidoo.&nbsp;&nbsp;
