KASI businessman Masibulele Dubumzi (27) doesn&rsquo;t believe in making excuses.&ldquo;One has to break the barriers and be responsible for their own life,&rdquo; he said Masibulele started operating his business on the side of the road in Mfuleni, outside Cape Town after struggling to get a job. &ldquo;After completing high school in 2010 I tried to get a job, but I didn&rsquo;t succeed. That&rsquo;s when I decided to repair shoes on the side of the road and my life started falling into place,&rdquo; he said.Masibulele said he wasn&rsquo;t making enough money from his shoe repair business so he decided to explore other opportunities.&ldquo;Now I sell second-hand clothes and shoes to my community. I realised people have to walk about 1km to buy electrical gadgets and hardware so I decided to also start selling them at my stall.&rdquo;He said many young people lose hope when they can&rsquo;t get a job and that leads them to a life of crime.Masibulele said he gets a lot of support from residents. &ldquo;I think the community supports me because they like my idea of running a legitimate business and that also helps them,&rdquo; he said.Masibulele told the SunTeam he sells his items at low prices to help people who can&rsquo;t afford expensive clothes.&ldquo;There are people who don&rsquo;t have enough clothes to wear. &ldquo;So instead of using their last cent to pay the taxi fare to go to town to buy clothes, they can buy from me.&rdquo; Nomsa Nyelenzi (30) bought school shoes for her five-year-old son from Masibulele last week.&ldquo;They were second-hand shoes but they were in good condition.&rdquo;
