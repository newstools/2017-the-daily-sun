Resident Sizwe Mchunu (28) said Councillor Mamane Xulu had made it clear she didn’t like the people of Siyanda and she would not help them. “When we call her to meetings, she doesn’t come. When we go to look for her at her office, we never find her,” he said. Sizwe claimed when residents phoned Xulu, she told them she would never help them because they came from a dirty and stinking place. Another resident claimed Xulu had refused to give her a proof of residence letter. “I wanted it to open a bank account but the councillor told me to go away.”When the SunTeam asked Xulu about the residents’ claims, she said she would never be forced to step down. “I was in Siyanda in July for a community meeting. They didn’t raise any concerns,” she said. ANC regional secretary Bheki Ntuli said the party would investigate. “We cannot just do what a group of people want,” said Ntuli. “We need to find out who these people are and listen to their grievances before coming up with a solution that’s suitable for everyone.” KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said police were on the scene and no incidents of violence were reported.
