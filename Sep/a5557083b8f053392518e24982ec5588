Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is to be sworn in as an MP, the office of the ANC chief whip has confirmed. Nonceba Mhlauli, spokesperson to ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu confirmed to News24 on Friday evening that she would be sworn in but said they were still waiting for a date from the speaker's office when this will take effect. According to eNCA she will replace Pule Mabe, who resigned from Parliament earlier this month. Mabe hung up his gloves just two months after being deployed as whip in Parliament&rsquo;s finance committee, replacing now Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen,&nbsp;City Press&nbsp;reported. ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe told News24 that Dlamini-Zuma did not ask to go to Parliament, but the party leadership discussed it and felt it would be unfair to keep her out. "Before she left for the African Union Commission (in 2012) to be chair she was in the top 20 on the (ANC's) national list of people to go to Parliament," he said.When asked if she was headed for a cabinet post, Mantashe said: "I don't deploy to government, only to Parliament".Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be sworn in as an MP next week.
