    The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) would like to apologize to Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma for the recent mistakes on our news bulletins. We believe that these mistakes were demeaning to Dr Dlamini Zuma. In early August this year when Dr Dlamini Zuma’s name was spelled incorrectly, the SABC apologized and regarded this to be a human error. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1689103318&t=artid%3d46e1219e-9130-4db5-92e9-61c1e3c83a0f%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" target="_blank"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/DailySun/News/National_Article&sz=300x250&c=1689103318&t=artid%3d46e1219e-9130-4db5-92e9-61c1e3c83a0f%26accreditation%3ddaily+sun%26posno%3d2" border="0" alt=""></a>More recently, one of our news headlines referred to her as an ex-wife, rather than using her name. This was sexist and wrong. The flippant response from the SABC spokesperson when asked about this was equally insulting. The Interim Board and Management of the SABC view this matter in a serious light  and are dealing with it with the urgency it deserves. The Directors of the SABC have since instructed News management to investigate the matter thoroughly and urgently in order to get to the bottom of it and ensure  that the SABC remains non-partisan. The statement by the SABC Spokesperson will also form part of this investigation and both the Board and Management remain committed to taking whatever steps are deemed necessary in dealing with both the initial mistake and the consequent erroneous response. As a public service broadcaster, the SABC remains committed to serving South Africa and the African continent diligently in fostering a non-sexist and non-racist approach to our coverage of events here and elsewhere as expected of us.
