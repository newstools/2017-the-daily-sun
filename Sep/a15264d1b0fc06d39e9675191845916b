Mzansi's getting down to a new hot Gqom track called uBabaKaDuduzane. The track was produced by Tboy Deflame.It features EFF leaders Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Julius Malema and National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete.The video also features president Zuma getting down to the beats.Judging by its popularity the song might be one of the biggest tracks this festive season.The song was inspired by the two EFF leaders who referred to president Jacob Zuma as Duduzane's father and Ubaba ka Duduzane in parliament because they didn't want to call him honourable. As expected, the song has now being followed up with funny memes all over social media.
