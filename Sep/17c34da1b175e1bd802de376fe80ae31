He gave them the keys to their new house.Nompumelelo Ndlovu (28) said she’s happy to have received a house. She is unemployed and has had to raise her two younger sisters, Thalente (9) and Thando (7), all by herself.“When we heard our brother was dead, we couldn’t believe it because he was the only one who was working. “He’s always provided for us ever since our parents died in the early 2000s.”She said they’re glad the municipality has remembered them.Their aunt, Thabisile Ndlovu (53), said she’s relieved that her nieces will now sleep in a safe house.She said the shack they used to live in, which was made of wood and mud, was not safe.The shack was very old and the rain used to come in.“They won’t have to worry about the rain or windy weather anymore,” said Thabisile.Jozini mayor Delani Mabika said the royal family covered all the funeral costs for Vusi.He said their duty was to make sure the girls were taken care of.He said when they attended Vusi’s funeral, they saw the terrible shack the girls lived in and promised to come back and wipe away their tears. “Today we came back to fulfil the promise we made when we buried Vusi,” said Mabika.
