THE charismatic Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso failed to
present any new facts to the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court in his second
bail application today, and will therefore remain behind bars for now.Magistrate Thandeka Mashiyi, who presided over both of
Omotoso's bail applications, found that the Durban-based televangelist’s new
legal counsel, headed by Advocate Alwyn Rossouw SC, had failed to present any
new facts to the court.The 59-year-old pastor is facing charges of human
trafficking, sexual assault and the rape of young girls.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv_bZ85m2f0BpMBGAPGkV2aTTMWksMXH2hhrX_HEOBmu5OEN1N7Si7VbmdTtY7s3VOGeDoY7hEh8tDvOnRdCoIBf3xU9j5KGkq7mtn6Uab81daOuOHhpPVU35czH6mfOIg0cADtnCOBSdl3xbqx1Pp_OWyw8xXJsSFwnGTdDnfa6TfM4ittpbH-1bvwsxICEtLazNMotYz_0Bm31VxePNfGnk60OfxjDuIuztOvgbcogiTnTn2nVNcknVj8iutwqVmwYzQswcpLx7BaM0waXydPZJExA5g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEcO75veKlxkEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Omotoso's status was that of a legal immigrant, that he had a fixed address and
the affidavit submitted regarding the pastor's charitable work and the impact
his incarceration has had, did not amount to exceptional circumstances.Rossouw also presented the court with a character
reference, which detailed how the pastor was actively involved in communities
around the country through his televangelist work and as the head of the
Timothy Omotoso Global Outreach programme.Mashiyi said she could not understand why this
information had not been placed before the court in the first application, as
Omotoso had chosen to supply an affidavit in his defence and could have easily
included the information there.She also ruled that the argument relating to Omotoso's
address had been dealt with extensively in the first application so there was
nothing new in Rossouw's submissions."It is my conclusion that the applicant has failed
to present any new facts in this matter," she said.NPA’s Tshepo Ndwalaza said they were happy with the
outcome of the second bail application."As the NPA we feel vindicated. We feel we have been
able to convince the court this man must not get bail. He has a case to answer
for in the court of law."Hundreds of the pastor's supporters once again gathered
outside in support of the televangelist, while members of the African National
Congress also gathered to call for his bail to be denied. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/omotosos-second-bail-application-denied-20170908
