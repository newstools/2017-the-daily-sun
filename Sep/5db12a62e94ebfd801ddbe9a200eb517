BIDVEST Wits CEO, Jose Ferreira, insists Phakamani Mahlambi will get his chance to play overseas if they get the right offer.The speedy winger returned home last week after unsuccessful trials at Vitoria Guimaraes.&nbsp;The Portuguese club were not interested in sealing a deal immediately, as they felt he still needed more time to develop.&nbsp;But Mahlambi might realise his dream via Egyptian giants, Al Ahly, who have shown interest in his services. The North African giants still have time to negotiate with Ferreira, as their transfer window deadline is on 14 September.Said Ferreira: &ldquo;Phakamani obviously has aspirations to play overseas. It&rsquo;s &nbsp;any player&rsquo;s dream, particularly at his age. If there&rsquo;s a good offer for the player and it&rsquo;s good for the club, we won&rsquo;t stand on their way. That applies right across the board to any player at Bidvest Wits. There&rsquo;s no need for a buyout clause to be exercised for us to release players.&rdquo;Added Ferreira: &ldquo;There has been a lot of interest from a lot of clubs &ndash; both domestically and overseas. But at this point, there is nothing concrete other than the fact that interest exists.&rdquo;Ferreira is delighted that there is huge interest on South African players from overseas clubs.But he blasted the teams that dangle big carrots in front of their players without following proper channels.&ldquo;The South African player is an attractive player internationally today. Today, we&rsquo;ve got lots of valuable young players like Liam Jordan playing at Sporting Lisbon, there is huge interest in Phakamani. Lebogang Manyama is going to Turkey.&ldquo;So, the days when South African clubs could come to another local club and just throw an open cheque book to try and get a player, are over,&rdquo; said Ferreira.&nbsp;Ferreira hailed the Premier Soccer League for the quality football that has attracted overseas clubs to lure players into their stable.&ldquo;Our league is a lot more visible out there. &ldquo;Take Phakamani, we played against Al Ahly and the whole of Africa watched that game.&ldquo;I think we are at a different level than we were a couple of years back.&ldquo;The national team can only benefit from that,&rdquo; he said.
