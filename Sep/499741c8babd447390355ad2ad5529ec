RESIDENTS of TikiTiki Village in Qumbu, near Mthatha face a different kind of service delivery problem. For the past 20 years, a clinic has been built bit by bit until it was finally completed last year. But the people still have to travel over 30km to other clinics because the new R12 million clinic has no staff!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst6bcidb2cjme7ILsoF1VIrht5ZH3UvmIfgBgeRrNHGV9SM5wA_uZ6TuiZVFR4UlLr_-AfqNJrGJ41Xa7b085kUywxOILWwi4Aes88zCSaSp0YQGNVL-HluDdv9025mnknoH2ogUBcuRm8v5zPkmRzOMoyeFl8Qul-1iNEiUWLFH8f393xGnChvNhlzG7Lk2kg1dPxRic_l7XVsh56Yo8scP11mjsv47YkMGXbdh82a1yojFwlJiN5Ty-libjgZXbkGCV5mRDLYS0VRy6zKaFQjs4R3Daw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJdEKAADn4GbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

When the SunTeam arrived, they were angry.Community leader Bless Kgosi said unlike other areas where people burn what they have to get attention, they wouldn’t torch the clinic. “We’ve had enough of using our grocery money to get to hospital. We want the department to open this clinic and serve the people,” Kgosi demanded.Gogo Cecilia Njokweni (79) said she has to travel to Dr Malizo Mpehle Hospital twice a month to get arthritis medication, using her pension money.“When we go to the hospital, we have to hitchhike, which isn’t safe, especially for old people. If the clinic could be opened, we would not be going through this heartache,” said gogo.Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the clinic was one of eight built in the OR Tambo region. “The clinics still need to be staffed. The department is busy recruiting. It will open in due course.”
