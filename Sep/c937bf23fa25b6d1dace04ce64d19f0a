    THE South African Broadcasting Corporation posted a R977m loss after tax for the 2016/17 financial year, its annual report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday revealed. The public broadcaster's net loss for the year ending March 2017 more than doubled from R412m in 2016 after a year of upheaval that included the dissolution of the permanent board in late 2016. Revenue declined from R8.1 billion in 2016 to R7.6 billion, representing a 6% year-on-year decrease. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsunE4vLeVPgzsCkocB7RD25-2MdrJx5hxn02DGp3tMnMvNCwGFc__KYgPIxaoVSChuscfuiy7LPQNTqVWNG5D_41KxkFhf87LN41mjV5IF-o6D3KEOXaIy05nHuqbF0nSzUtsCxH67HZqu7D7RKh7fphnfJhjIolYNuXPKxnC0OJkJHNV6X2xVXNAtkZOCTZ8h3AgtsHtjR5qUlrIS8jqMmhGiCbzQjWawZNtVVN0pjUsazXpFbAUj8shOdneXTUP89tOeU_mb1_Pv3sLF-3jXs5x5cBj8\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDbere4PwHv5EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Sponsorship revenue declined by 18% to R384 million while TV licence revenue decreased 7% to R915 million. Operational expenses remained the same at R8.6 billion. The report also said the SABC had a cash balance of R82 million, representing a net outflow of R800 million since the previous year."The fact that operational cash was used to fund capital expenditure projects, the cost of delivering on the broadcaster's public service mandate and the rising cost of sports rights contribute to the pressure being placed on the organisation's cash reserves," the report reads.
