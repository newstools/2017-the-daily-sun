But his contribution last season had failed to bring stability to the last line of defence. The club conceded 37 goals in 30 matches.Said the insider: “Eymael wants to build Stars from scratch with his own technical team. He doesn’t want to inherit the old staff.”The insider said the idea to search for a staff in Belgium came after Eymael failed to convince his countryman, Jean Luscuito, to be his assistant.“Luc was then left with no choice but to convince management to agree to his plea,” said the source.The Black Leopards mentor (Luscuito) wasn’t prepared to downgrade, as he was approached to lead Ea Lla Koto before the side settled on Troughton.Also, that move failed becausehis was due to the fact that Leopards boss David Thidiela demanded R2 million to release Luscuito from his contract. And Stars boss Rantsi Mokoena said he didn’t know anything about the coach bringing his own technical team.
