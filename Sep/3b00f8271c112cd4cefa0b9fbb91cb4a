The matter was not raised again during his question and answer session and he mostly fielded questions on job creation and economic growth. He said the announcement by Statistics SA yesterday that the country had moved out of technical recession was good news but it was not yet time to celebrate. He said unemployment was a problem that affected not only the youth but the elderly too. He admitted there were economic issues that still needed to be addressed. “We are working on several fronts to build confidence and productivity in our economy. To raise employment sustainably, we need more inclusive growth. “We need to change the structure of the economy and demonstrably encourage more start-ups and new entrants into our economy.”Ramaphosa said South Africa needed more regional trade and projects to support investment and growth. “If we can focus on the progress of our economy, this will give us the inspiration to create the South Africa all of us desire.“We are making great strides in skills training for our youth in marine training and ín various other technical aspects.” Ramaphosa warned against what has been called the fourth industrial revolution, which is likely to see many jobs replaced by robots. “We must be prepared and create jobs that will not easily be replaced by robots.”
