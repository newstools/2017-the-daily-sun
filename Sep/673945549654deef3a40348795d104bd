It was only the third career goal for the former Wits defensive midfielder.AmaZulu turned the second half on its head when they won a soft penalty after defender Phumlani Ntshangase handled the ball inside the danger area on the hour mark. Rhulani Manzini stepped up and slotted home a powerful spot kick to make it 2-0.Manzini made it 3-0 and game over two minutes later when he foxed the flat footed Wits defence and thumped home his side’s third goal to earn AmaZulu their second win of the season.It was a superb comeback from the home side who were beaten 4-1 in a Durban derby by Golden Arrows at the weekend.In other matches played last night Baroka FC’s incredible early season form continued when they scored a 2-0 win over Bloemfontein Celtic at the Free State Stadium thanks to goals from Sipho Moeti and Gift MotupaGolden Arrows edged bottom club Platinum Stars 1-0 at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium to move to 11 points at the top of the table with Baroka and Pirates after five games.
