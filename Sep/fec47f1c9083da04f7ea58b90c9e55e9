She starts crying at 2am and she doesn’t stop until 5am.” Sangoma Ndabazomoya Sotshononda said residents were hearing the spirit of someone who wasn’t free. The sangoma said: “The family should have collected her spirit when she died and directed it to its final resting place. The dead woman’s relatives need to be called.”
