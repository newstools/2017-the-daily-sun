He asked us to help him go to rehab,” she said.“It’s sad that he died while we were still planning to book him into rehab. “We wanted to help him become a better human being.” She denied that her nephew was a thief, saying he was quiet and loving.“We were called to the road by a neighbour after Vezokwakhe had been beaten,” said Hlengiwe. “My heart was very sore when I saw him lying in a pool of blood. “I called the ambulance because he was still alive, but sadly he died in hospital two days later. “Yes, he smoked drugs, but he was not a thief. He loved his family and neighbours. “The people who killed him should have handed him over to the police if they really believed he stole from them. “He would get money from piece jobs to buy whoonga. “We never hid our purses. He didn’t steal them. Neighbours never complained that he stole from them.” Police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “Plessislaer cops said no one had opened a case.”
