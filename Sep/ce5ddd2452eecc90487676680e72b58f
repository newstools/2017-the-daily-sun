GOLDEN Arrows head coach Clinton Larsen says people shouldn&rsquo;t be thinking too much about the performance they gave against reigning Absa Premiership Bidvest Wits when they face AmaZulu in a Durban derby on Sunday.&nbsp;Abafana Bes&rsquo;thende were outstanding in their 3-1 victory over the Students on Wednesday.Said Larsen: &ldquo;You are only as good as your last match when you play in a derby.&rdquo; He said nothing was guaranteed in this match at Princess Magogo Stadium in KwaMashu (3pm). &ldquo;We performed well in previous matches. The only difference in the Wits game is that we succeeded in taking our chances. If we continue performing this way, we will go a long way this season.&nbsp;&ldquo;Having said that, a match against AmaZulu is a different ball game altogether. Form and your last results are thrown out of the window in derbies.&nbsp;&ldquo;Players sometimes tend to overcook things. And sometimes they just don&rsquo;t show up in a match at all.&rdquo;Larsen also commented on how his charges masterminded their first victory of the season by beating the defending champions.&nbsp;He said nothing had changed in the way they played &ndash; it was similar to their three previous matches.&ldquo;I was not surprised by the way we performed against Wits. We played the same way when we lost to them in the MTN8, also when we drew away to Ajax Cape Town and at home to Bloemfontein Celtic.&nbsp; &ldquo;In those matches we were simply unlucky not to finish them off. Last night (Wednesday) we were able to take the chances we are always creating in our matches,&rdquo; said Larsen.
