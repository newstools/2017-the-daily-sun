They went to tell the elders in the neighbourhood that their granny and mother had been shot,” Manatha confirmed.Both women had been shot in their upper bodies and died in the home.In both instances, nothing was stolen from the scene.Manatha said police had not yet determined a motive for the murders.No arrests have yet been made, although detectives were following “strong leads“, he added.Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga on Wednesday said officers would “work around the clock to trace the perpetrators“. She added that she condemned the murders “in the strongest way“.“We will not allow callous criminals to target the most vulnerable in our society. I have before and again urged our rural communities to urgently come together with local station commanders, community police forums and chiefs or headmen to discuss ways and means to assist each other to better protect our elderly women.”
