TENSIONS are rising in Pietermaritzburg between two taxi associations fighting over routes.Taxis from Esigodini Taxi Association were not operating yesterday following a shoot-out between members of the Esigodini and Edendale Taxi Associations on Monday.The associations are using the same route to get to the Pietermaritzburg CBD.It is alleged that Edendale taxis pick up residents from Esigodini as well, which has angered the association.Esigodini residents said taxi drivers blocked the road with big stones on Monday to prevent Edendale taxis from operating in the area.&ldquo;We suspect this angered Edendale taxi drivers, who allegedly started shooting. &ldquo;Currently there are no taxis, leaving residents without cars stranded and unable to get to work,&rdquo; said a resident.Another resident said they fear more shooting incidents will follow and that innocent bystanders may get hurt or killed.&ldquo;The two associations should sort out their issues in a civilised manner. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get hurt. All we want is to reach our destinations safely.&rdquo; KZN Taxi Alliance spokesman Bafana Mhlongo said they hadn&rsquo;t heard of a fight between the two associations.&ldquo;When disputes arise, we normally call the parties to a meeting. &ldquo;We encourage tolerance in our industry,&rdquo; said Mhlongo.Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said two people were injured during the shooting.&ldquo;Charges of attempted murder are investigated by Plessislaer cops. Several vehicles were damaged. The suspects are still unknown and no arrests have been made.&rdquo; The two associations were not available for comment.
