AFTER being frozen out of his job on Sunday by National First Division (NFD) club Royal Eagles, Allan Freese admitted to popping out his eyes in the job market as he seeks a employment.Freese became the second coach to be shown the door in less than a week after Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela was booted out by Chippa United last Thursday.The former Highlands Park mentor was fired after a poor start to the new campaign.&nbsp;The soft spoken coach said he is holding no grudges against Eagles: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way back home. We had a meeting yesterday (on Sunday) and we decided to part ways. I understood and it&rsquo;s part of this job.&rdquo;Freese leaves the club fresh from 2-1 defeat to University of Pretoria on Saturday with the ambitious Eagles yet to register a win in four matches.They drew two and lost two and are currently at the bottom of NFD log table. They are tied on two points at the foot of the NFD with their KwaZulu-Natal rivals Richards Bay FC.&nbsp; It is still unclear who will replace Freese as Eagles general manager James Dlamini was not available on his phone.Other coach who find himself following Freese if results don&rsquo;t change is Roger Sikhakhane whose Richards Bay FC haven&rsquo;t yet found their rhythm.On Sunday they lost 1-0 to Jomo Cosmos and that was their second defeat in four matches. Other two matches ended in draws.
