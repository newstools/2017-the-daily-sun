How can you stay with the father of your baby and visit your lover? This should serve a lesson for anyone who is cheating. Dump the one you don’t want in your life,” said a resident.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvYRk-26B_OSOAkpvzh1HeCsv9R_cWyMqcWX0ucovVBWzpaXkZ_4TtfP_2b_bWAlYaiUvmSbT8HIFUTM7R5L0UXoTf86JYn7w7kmkDr2kNpaL477L-LunjR2EDyu2U5e-6KFLOVJOAqSiByEELQyvKQK5KdQ1sJ6KspejKFlmrhooGuw8xMZpiCCElCiJLP5OkUh602jXP75zKvsceLYSLRT5VboGWYTDosA2masDOtkyX9lT4r9bJHz5NcJcZllyp4rr88RxK1OsTW0wB_HgPHfBJrqmA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBMbQcn5_vKPEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

No one deserves to die as they did. I have heard that Nokwanela’s boyfriend threatened to kill her at some point. “I don’t know how I’m going to take care of the five kids she left behind. They are my responsibility now. My sister should have left him because she was clearly not happy,” said Futshane. Nokwanela’s lover was allegedly unable to use his arms because he had suffered a stroke. But some of the injuries were on his left arm, which suggests he was trying to use his arm to protect himself.Khuselo Hodi (41), Nokwanela’s uncle, said neighbours didn’t hear anything.Western Cape Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said no one has been arrested.Anyone with information can phone CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
