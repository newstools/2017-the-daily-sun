I don&rsquo;t know what the driver was thinking.&rdquo; Kagiso is a grade 8 pupil at Kenneth Masikela Secondary School in Springs. Gogo Lebogang said they want justice, even though nothing can restore her grandson&rsquo;s dreams. &ldquo;It is so painful to see him like that. We want whoever did this to face the full force of the law.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t sleep at night thinking about him and the fact that he will never live his dream.&nbsp; &ldquo;All he wanted was to play soccer and he was very good at it.&rdquo; The community of KwaThema have been visiting gogo Lebogang door to offer support. Captain Thabo Sibue, police spokesman at the KwaThema cop shop, said so far only a case of reckless driving has been reported but the case could change after investigations were complete. &ldquo;Police are looking for the suspect, who apparently left the KwaThema area after the incident.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no warrant of arrest yet but police would like the driver to come forward for questioning.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;
