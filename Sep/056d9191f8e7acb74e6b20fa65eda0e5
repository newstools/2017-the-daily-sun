THE shocked uncle of four young siblings who were brutally killed recently said their body parts were probably used for muthi. Ben Mbhele (34) from Ncukeni in Port Edward, on the KZN South Coast, told Daily Sun the killer of his sister&rsquo;s children could be an enemy who really wanted them to feel pain. The bodies of Lwandle (4), Simphiwe (8), Lwandile (10) and Bandile Mbhele (12) were found at their home on Saturday morning with stab wounds. Three, and not four as originally reported, had their left ears cut off. &ldquo;Only Lwandile still had both his ears,&rdquo; Ben said.The uncle was at work when he received a call informing him about the incident. &ldquo;I rushed home and was traumatised when I arrived and saw their bodies covered in blood,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever forget that. I was told Bandile had gone to a neighbour&rsquo;s house on Friday evening and complained that an uncle was tying their hands. The neighbour told him to go home and fetch a blanket and come back to sleep there, but he never came back. &ldquo;The neighbour didn&rsquo;t even bother to go and check on them at the house. She knew the children were alone.&ldquo;I heard the neighbour only went to the house the next morning, where she found all four kids dead. Other neighbours said they didn&rsquo;t hear anything.&rdquo; His sister arrived when police were already at the house.When the SunTeam asked KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala why the mother of the kids had not been arrested for child neglect, she said the matter was still under investigation. &ldquo;Once the investigation is completed, the docket will be taken to court for a decision on whether to prosecute the children&rsquo;s mother or not,&rdquo; said Gwala.
