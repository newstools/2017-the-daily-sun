Dear MizzBMy woman has a child from a previous relationship. Even though I have two of my own kids, she always asks me for money, reminding me she has a child.She’s unemployed but does nothing for me. Her demands really hurt my feelings.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>- IsraelDear IsraelBeing the ATM in the relationship is frustrating. Especially when a partner withdraws cash from you without depositing meaningfully into your life.To help you understand and respect each other, speak to her about both of your expectations from the relationship.If she wants you to take care of her child, she has to do the same with your kids.As a parent, you should look at your partner’s behaviour. Love works when people work together to make it successful.READ: FIND YOUR FIRE AND EXPLODE!
