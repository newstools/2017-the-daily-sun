Allegedly one of the scrapyard owners then approached the officers and offered them a R10 000 bribe.Metro cop spokesman Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the owners were arrested for being in possession of copper cable stolen from the Joburg inner city.Minnaar said it was alleged that more of the stolen copper cables were at two other scrapyards in Robertsville.He confirmed the alleged attempted bribery. People took to Twitter to commend the officers for a job well done.Mbuzeni wrote: “Good officers.”Stanley Dido said: “Massive respect to these officers.”Dee Kee wrote: “That’s the law enforcement officers that we need... Great work.”Joburg’s mayor Herman Mashaba thanked the public for answering the city’s call and stepping forward with information leading to the arrest.
