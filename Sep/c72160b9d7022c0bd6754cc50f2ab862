    SUNHERO Lufuno Malalelei was honoured on Saturday for risking his life to try and save a younger boy. Although the 16-year-old failed to rescue Bafana Zwane (11), he was showered with love and gifts at the boy’s funeral in Slovoville, Soweto, on Saturday. Last week, Lufuno put his life on the line when he saw Bafana was trapped in muddy water in a deep ditch. There were many onlookers but Lufuno was the only one willing to go in to help. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuHR4JXwvc6weN_35IoW1obWqiXsiucj3LxnGXQLm1y1OYuK7G_F5qCon-OJl9TLO2SK-4cvEks4YCcNpstnUJzUtgWOrzdmyzQNfoW7dgZDpK2M3PsxIcghxmFZacwDdjrY6N9y7BhC06N1fPYU-0C9d2WpWP8b_X-VuM3Y8A-xNuBVr__NOWpYXnpiSymrnGnq30c-nJn8cPw7PP-cnXdFFhHr8Pb1BQ99vDSwUHtaHC6CjyG7YkB9iEA-fdtdHqGZkGVpD0aWWgejoqiwlDqWQjNfGI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJW-jb-K7vC7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The family asked Lufuno to attend the funeral as the community wanted to thank him for his bravery. During the service, Lufuno was called forward so the whole family could embrace him. He was then showered with gifts from the community and the family. Tearful Lufuno said: “I don’t know what to say. This is overwhelming. I’m very grateful to the community and the family for what they have done for me. “I feel so blessed. I just knew I had to do something to try and help the little boy.” Community members said they were angry that the Joburg Roads Agency had not put up warning signs or barricades after digging a trench to lay pipes. Agency spokeswoman Bertha Scheepers said the place had now been barricaded and the matter reported to the labour department.Bafana’s mum, Lindiwe (32), said she gave Lufuno a sacred blanket to protect him. “It serves as armour and we pray the Lord will bless him in whatever he does.”
