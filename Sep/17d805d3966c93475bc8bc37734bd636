CHIPPA United and Dan &ldquo;Dance&rdquo; Malesela&rsquo;s working relationship may very well be history by the time you read this.SunSport has reliably learned that the relationship between Malesela and Chilli Boys chairman Siviwe &ldquo;Chippa&rdquo; Mpengesi has broken down beyond repair.It is understood that the coach&rsquo;s agent, Tim Sukazi, and Mpengesi&rsquo;s representatives were due to meet last night to decide on a settlement to let Malesela move on with his life.The straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back was Chippa&rsquo;s 3-1 Absa Premiership loss to Baroka FC on Tuesday, a result that apparently made Mpengesi go wild, refusing to even engage with Malesela.&ldquo;Chippa called Sukazi and told him that he wants to meet to clear up their relationship with the coach,&rdquo; SunSport&rsquo;s informant said.&ldquo;Basically Dan is no longer Chippa coach because Mpengesi has already decided and will not back down. &ldquo;The relationship between Chippa and Dan has not been the same since he put the coach on forced leave earlier this year. The good thing to come out of this whole matter is that Dan holds the record for being the longest serving Chippa United coach. Funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;Malesela was put on special leave in April this year due to the Chilli Boys&rsquo; poor run in the league last season, which saw them drop to 12th spot in the table.But he was recalled a month later when the club looked on the verge of relegation.Mpengesi was unavailable for comment yesterday while Sukazi&rsquo;s cellphone ran unanswered. Messages were not returned.In three matches played, Chippa have won once and lost twice &ndash; sitting pretty in 10th place with three points.
