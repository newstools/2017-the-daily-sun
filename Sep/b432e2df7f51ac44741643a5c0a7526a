The woman reported the alleged incident to the police and a manhunt was launched on the Sunday afternoon," he said. Brigadier Ramakamakama Kekana said in a statement that the crime was unacceptable."Same-sex interaction is not an atrocity in Sunnyside; rape is," he said."In spite of the victim reportedly having made it clear to him that she no longer dated men, he allegedly saw it fit to enforce his own cultural beliefs on a vulnerable woman," said Kekana.The alleged rapist cannot be named as he was not asked to plead.
