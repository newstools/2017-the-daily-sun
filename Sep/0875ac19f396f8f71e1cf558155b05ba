IT IS &ldquo;wafa wafa&rdquo; (one must die), in the eyes of Pitso Mosimane! That is how the Mamelodi Sundowns coach sees their African Champions League quarterfinal, second leg showdown with Wydad Casablanca at the King Mohammed V Stadium in Morocco on Saturday.The 53-year-old said this following his side&rsquo;s crucial 1-0 win in the first leg at Atteridgeville&rsquo;s Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday &ndash; thanks to Yannick Zakri&rsquo;s tap-in that gave them the edge over their Moroccan counterparts.&ldquo;We have to give everything we have. This is the last match of the quarterfinal. You win, you are in the semifinals and you lose, then you are out.&rdquo;For the Brazilians to move to the semis, they must hold the Kings of Titles, as Wydad are known, to a draw or win the match.Should Sundowns lose by a margin of more than one goal, they will kiss the title they won last year goodbye.The African champions coach who is also the 2016 African Coach of the Year, promised that the Tshwane side would not be intimidated by the hostile reception they expect to get in Morocco.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a fight there,&rdquo; said Mosimane ahead of their flight to Morocco tonight. &ldquo;But we have experience playing in the Champions League. We know their mentality. They will come to your bench and provoke you. They will also burn things. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s their culture, mentality and belief when they play at home. &ldquo;We have been to Zamalek, Ah Ahly, Esperance and it was tough, but we made it. We are the champions of Africa &ndash; we have the experience and know what to expect there. &ldquo;And we believe we will do what we did to them here. I have many international players with experience playing in North Africa. I believe we will get a good result again.&rdquo; Added the coach: &ldquo;I also have much experience in playing international football, which I picked up during my days with Bafana Bafana. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s is why I only want to coach clubs that want to play in the Champions League.&rdquo; Mosimane is hoping to have his star players Khama Billiat and Anthony Laffor back for this return clash after missing them in the first leg due to an assortment of injuries.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what happens after they see our two doctors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think Khama has a chance but he needs to be in the right frame of mind too, as he has not played for a while. But I would love to have them both back. &ldquo;I am sure you saw that I played Oupa Manyisa as striker on Sunday. I hope to have one more attacker for this clash.&rdquo;
