The reason for Francois Hougaard obviously - he is a fantastic rugby player and it is just that that continuity hasn’t been part of this - like not playing regularly at nine has not helped him with his technical ability at scrumhalf at Test match level,” Coetzee said.“Unfortunately that is the case and it hasn’t gone well, because I think it is important that our nines function really well. And I just think technically at that level it has been a struggle for him really.”Along with Schreuder, first-choice Ross Cronje and Rudy Paige are the other scrumhalves in the Bok squad for the home Tests against Australia (Bloemfontein, September 30) and New Zealand (Cape Town, October 7).30-man Springbok squadForwards (17 players):Uzair Cassiem, Lood de Jager, Ruan Dreyer, Dan du Preez, Jean-Luc du Preez, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Eben Etzebeth (captain), Steven Kitshoff, Siya Kolisi, Francois Louw, Wilco Louw, Malcolm Marx, Bongi Mbonambi, Franco Mostert, Tendai Mtawarira, Trevor Nyakane, Chiliboy RalepelleBacks (13 players):Andries Coetzee, Ross Cronje, Damian de Allende, Elton Jantjies, Jesse Kriel, Dillyn Leyds, Rudy Paige, Handre Pollard, Raymond Rhule, Louis Schreuder, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan, S’busiso Nkosi
