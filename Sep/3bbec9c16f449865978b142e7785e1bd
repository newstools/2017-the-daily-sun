Xolile said it was their job to distribute the condoms so that people could stay safe.“We want other community members to join us when we have these events because some people don’t understand gays and transgenders,” he said. Sibusiso Ngqungqeka (28) said projects such as Health For Men are important because the number of gay people who die from Aids was high. “We’re hoping events like these will help decrease the number.”Such projects would help save the lives of many gay and transgender people. Xolile said: “Lesbians are the most active people and they take good care of themselves.”Xola Tatubana, a 21-year-old transgender, admitted that some gay people tended to isolate themselves. “These events are good because we get to know and understand each other,” said Xola.Mzoxolo Jaji told the People’s Paper it was the first time he’d attended such an event.“They’re a bunch of outspoken people and I enjoyed what they were doing.” Mzoxolo, who is straight, said he respected gay and transgender people, and that their sexuality was their choice.
