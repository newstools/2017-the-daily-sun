Cici’s court appearance came a day after Arthur was in the dock on the assault charge she laid against him. The assault case against the kwaito singer and producer was postponed to 3 November. He had previously failed to convince Cici to agree to settle the matter out of court. Earlier this year, Cici told reporters she might not be able to have children as a result of the surgery.Themba Masango of #NotInMyName yesterday again called on Arthur to plead guilty. “This is our sister and we’re going to protect her,” he said.
