MAMELODI SUNDOWNS can&rsquo;t afford to slip up when they host Wydad Casablanca in the Caf Champions League quarterfinals first leg at Lucas Moripe Stadium today (3pm).Downs coach, Pitso Mosimane, is bracing himself for the big challenge and dealing with a series of attacks from the Moroccan giants.But the former Bafana Bafana mentor insisted that his charges won&rsquo;t park the bus. &ldquo;Teams in the African Champions League are tactically organised,&rdquo; said Mosimane.&ldquo;In South Africa players are prepared to sit at the back and wait to catch you on the break, but it&rsquo;s a different ball game in the Champions League.&ldquo;Teams in this competition take only 10 to 15 minutes to identify your weaknesses and start coming to you where you are shaky,&rdquo; he said. Mosimane is pleading with Mzansi&rsquo;s football fraternity to rally behind his side in numbers.He went on to say: &ldquo;We have to make people want to come back to the stadiums to watch the game, and for that we must start scoring goals and play good attacking football.&rdquo; The former SuperSport mentor is confident his charges will overcome Casablanca to ensure they have an advantage ahead of the return leg at Stade Mohamed V in Morocco on Saturday.&ldquo;We will leave a day after the match (tomorrow), to start preparing for the second leg and will be camping in Mozambique,&rdquo; Mosimane explained. &ldquo;And that is how confident I am about winning these two legs.&rdquo;The coach will rely heavily on the experiences of African Goalkeeper of the Year, Dennis Onyango, captain Hlompho Kekana and Mzansi&rsquo;s golden boy Percy Tau in his bid to increase the Brazilians&rsquo;s chances of defending their trophy.Meanwhile, Mosimane&rsquo;s influential players, Khama Billiat and Anthony Laffor, are doubtful for this clash due to injuries.But the coach has been praying for a miracle to have at least one of them available because, as things stand, his team don&rsquo;t have any quality attacking players for this match.
