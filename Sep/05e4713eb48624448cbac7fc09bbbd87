RONALD Mojela says his life has been difficult ever since he was injured at work in 2010. The 46-year-old traffic cop from Soshanguve, Tshwane told Daily Sun after he was involved in a car accident, he was fired without his knowledge while he was in hospital! After a legal battle he was reinstated in 2013 but he said even though he reported for duty, he was given nothing to do at work. He was later sent to do general work at the city council offices in Akasia, but Ronald felt he was still not being treated fairly. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssOyzxR_peql2YqZv0MOXEofSl5nSb3lZcKZ5UMBM6yCBoxqpAjEPOzmSHAhCcHOeDaaNg7gAQOTPoCQXEX6-J6bVDq-SjVwNXjWJcMtNy9e9z4WOzlQYnK-Y_SNwbv_xv20FyGaVSlkl1monAGF-vPXy4d-MtrT3E-fnMlvvKrSXNpoyy7h2h1Z2W4Y62j7NC-H1_ohemHTy6lTgwrhrWcTcErEzHP6nfSq0waFu03AcABHLs3M0vFTo5qEvvK_Yi6Hu-AZqNd92XKlQLrb-2bUSHnJJU\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHlgfkJi8FUeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I wonder if I will even be buried as a Metro cop when I die. I feel like they’re trying to force me to resign.” Tshwane Metro police spokesman Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said they were aware of Ronald’s situation. “We are in the process of finalising his work conditions. “We have put structures in place for members to voice their concerns rather than going to the media,” he said.
