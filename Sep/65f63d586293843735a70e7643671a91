AN Indonesian man who claimed to be a pawing buaya (a kind of sangoma with
magic powers over crocodiles) has reportedly died after a crocodile apparently
attacked him.According to online publication Coconuts Jakarta, Suprianto had dived into the Muara Jawa estuary
in Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan last week to find the body of a man named
Arjuna. Arjuna had died the day before after being attacked by the reptiles in
the crocodile-filled waters.But instead of being protected from the crocs by his
supernatural powers, Suprianto was reportedly himself killed by them. Witnesses
reported that they saw him dragged below the surface of the water while he was
chanting and swimming.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsud43K57mUBQC9qNZFvZG9JifkhyrpSff-yWYZjHxk2XYDOYUrd8pX0PrgXIAABOxhV5mQUcD5bg3KD6qYA6rR-1VsAZBTchqR6seaizyGyi7YqClPneTaoGxqjmDiY6r_S65Nt5kW-ckr2H-VJsupheA6XykkxrThswn2lkpc6lBsPi373b-2dX881FqTD1ZKODhvLBOALXo8Vdi-KkzaACayEli12plmmPirQhphK8xr4mmtopTJPhV9UEPwY4T9wAkncYxvgLf2vc1aPek2NY0yxaxz80ypPMw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHe0EHNLyKVfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Police Chief Fadillah Zulkarnaen was quoted in reports as saying: “We have
recovered the two bodies. I think he was dragged by a croc under the water and
then ran out of oxygen. From the pictures I’ve seen, his body is still intact,
his arms and legs are still there.”Arjuna’s corpse was also still in one piece.Coconuts Jakarta reports
that there have been two other attacks by deadly reptiles in recent months. In
July, a crocodile “returned” the body of a man it had killed the day before
after supposedly answering a pawing buay’s
call.Elsewhere in Indonesia in March, a giant python reportedly
swallowed a man whole in West Sulawesi.
