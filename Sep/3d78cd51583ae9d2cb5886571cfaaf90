MOTORISTS say the bizarre decorations on the side of the busy N8 road between Bloemfontein and Kimberley are the stuff of nightmares.But madala Makhubane Zitha (68) claims his decorations are for their safety.&ldquo;I am doing this because I was instructed by my ancestors to do so,&rdquo; said Makhubane.He believes his goat skin covered stumps, dolls, stones and scrap will chase away evil.The madala told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Three months after losing my girlfriend on this road I saw my ancestors showing me goat skins and paint. I didn&rsquo;t understand what they wanted, but after consulting a traditional healer I was told it was an instruction I had to follow. &ldquo;I started decorating the road earlier this year and every month my work grows. &ldquo;Some passing motorists think I&rsquo;m out of my mind. I&rsquo;ve painted wood and covered it with goat skins just like in my dreams. Some offer me money to buy my decorations but I refuse. Others view it as art. I wouldn&rsquo;t have done this if it wasn&rsquo;t for my ancestors. I buy the goat skin from sangomas and go to the dump for other things,&rdquo; said Makhubane.Motorists told Daily Sun they were shocked by the roadside goat skin objects and weird looking dolls. Vusi Kgomo said: &ldquo;At first I thought the things were for sale until I saw they were dolls and scrap.&rdquo;
