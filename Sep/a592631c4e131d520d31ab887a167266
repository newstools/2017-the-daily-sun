THE family of ward Councillor Lindiwe Ncayiyana whose house was petrol bombed by unknown attackers is living in fear.They told Daily Sun they didn&rsquo;t know there were people who hated them so much they wanted to burn them to death. It happened in the early hours of yesterday morning in KwaMashu E section, north of Durban.It&rsquo;s alleged an unknown car was parked outside the councillor&rsquo;s house before the petrol bomb was thrown at about 1.30am. A relative, said they were woken up by the explosion as it hit the windows and roof. &ldquo;We saw a fire and ducked and hid under our beds,&rdquo; said the relative. &ldquo;After a short while we went outside and saw smoke on the roof. We then called the cops.&rdquo;The family didn&rsquo;t know who was behind the attack. &ldquo;It seems as if they were targeting the councillor, but they are wrong for doing this to our house. The councillor bought the house long before she was an elected official. This house doesn&rsquo;t belong to the eThekwini Municipality, or the ANC.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t say much, except that the attack showed there were people who hated them and wanted them to burn to death! A resident said he suspected that the people who petrol-bombed the house didn&rsquo;t like the councillor. &ldquo;Some people are still bitter about her being a councillor. Maybe they want her to resign,&rdquo; he said. KZN cops spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of arson was being investigated by KwaMashu police. &ldquo;The motive for the attack is unknown at this stage.&rdquo;Ncayiyana said: &ldquo;The people who did this want to destroy my work. I think it&rsquo;s the people who were against me when I was campaigning for the local government elections last year. They are now starting chaos again.&rdquo;She said she will ask for security guards because she now fears for her life.
