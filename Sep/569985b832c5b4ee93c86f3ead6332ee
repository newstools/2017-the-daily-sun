HE is a defender that is known for his tackles in the soccer field.But the Orlando Pirates player, Happy Jele couldn&rsquo;t defend himself when he was found on the wrong side of the law.Jele was nabbed by the Gauteng Traffic Police High Speed Unit clocking 223km/h.Gauteng provincial police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo on Monday confirmed that that Soccer player, was arrested and taken to Sandton cop shop.Masondo said the player was warned to appear in the Randburg Magistrates Court.Sources said Jele was driving a 135i BMW, travelling on the M1 near Sandton at an average speed of 223km/h zone.&nbsp;&ldquo;When the officers managed to stop him, he claimed he was on his way to attend to his sick child. It was later found that the information was untruthful and just an excuse.&ldquo;Jele was arrested on the spot and taken to Sandton Police Station where he was formally charged for reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/h.&rdquo;The source also said at the time of release the bail was not determined as yet, he appeared in the Randburg Magistrate Court.Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, has since condemned the incident."I am disappointed at Happy Jele&rsquo;s driving behaviour and conduct. Professional players are supposed to be role models and safety ambassadors.The Law Enforcement Agencies will not tolerate lawlessness behaviour on Gauteng roads especially with the high rate of fatalities reported in the province,&rdquo; said MEC Nkosi-Malobane.The department appeals to motorists to drive with caution and abide by the rules of the road at all times.Metro police chief Wayne Minnaar said the department can confirm that there was speed operation in the Sandton area where a man was arrested for exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/h.Masondo said the alleged arrested suspect will be charged with reckless and negligence driving.
