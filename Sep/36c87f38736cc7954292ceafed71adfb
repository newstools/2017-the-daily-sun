Museveni has been in power for 31 years.This would make it possible for Museveni to stand again in the 2021 elections.The proposal was due to be debated today in Parliament. But according to Daily Monitor, proceedings came to a chaotic halt when MP William Nzoghu claimed some members had entered Parliament armed with guns. He claimed that no one’s lives would be safe during the debate.Another MP, Mr Ssemujju, claimed that MP Ronald Kibuule had threatened his life.Ssemujju was quoted as saying: “The issue of our security takes precedence over everything even the ministerial statement on the energy sector. At the moment we don’t know who has the gun. Mr Kibuule warned me before the beginning of the proceedings that if I am not careful, I would be harmed. “Before we proceed, all members should be checked. I care about my life. The procedure issue I am raising is about my life. How can we proceed as if nothing has happened?”Speaker Rebecca Kadaga could only watch on helplessly as chaos ruled.Meanwhile, hundreds of protestors – mainly young people – have taken to the streets across Uganda in protest at changing the age limit.
