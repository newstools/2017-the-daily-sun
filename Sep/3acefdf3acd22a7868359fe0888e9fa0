The elite are those around him: the Guptas and those inside our movement," said SACP general secretary Solly Mapaila.He said the rolling mass action in support of Cosatu was not just another march, but signified an important moment when organised labour came out more clearly to express its disdain and disgust at those who were stealing from the country.Mapaila called on SACP members serving on the Cabinet to join the mass action."They must apologise for not going to Cabinet. If you are working tomorrow, give apologies," he said.
