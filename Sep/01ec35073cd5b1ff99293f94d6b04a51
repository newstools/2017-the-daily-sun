MANY people living near a crumbling dam in storm-battered
Puerto Rico have evacuated, Governor Ricardo Rossello said yesterday, as he
asked for more government aid to avert a humanitarian crisis after Hurricane
Maria.Much of the Caribbean island, a US territory with a
population of 3,4 million, is still without electricity five days after Maria
struck with vicious winds and torrential rains. It was the most powerful
hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly a century.There have been growing concerns for some 7 000 people
who live in the river valley below the Guajataca Dam in the island’s northwest,
where cracks were seen on Friday in the 88-year-old earthen structure.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss40Eqz9Zm4LDkqflQ_ti3jKDI979kNBVAbCYbu5L7rYcDVrwrxOnDPvc9viAUfLMgeiqh-ZJrWgqpWGIhUmqcfXePCAMo1rzjYS_yT5dbgWwsw-BcIZMd8vctf0UHbBxUMrd_KuY4Sfxhro8UyxH8OQTbiLri2D9L9RomGLW7FHJB0TigR7jDw-7TXCYD78g_HrM5VWjYalKKYXg-nF1CL9aEPcLRiDZRAp5i6xOqLIsIL4e7MwE7EVarRg-TV7SzZPonDbhHgpK2p6Bs9Zud0Osh_kv-jN79ebA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJ5xm3QSpJ-mEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

dam would collapse.“I’d rather be wrong on that front than doing nothing and
having that fail and costing people lives,” he said. “Most of the people in the
near vicinity have evacuated.”The fear of a potentially catastrophic dam break added to
the immense task facing disaster relief authorities after Maria, which was the
second major hurricane to strike the Caribbean this month. The storm killed at
least 29 people in the region, at least 10 of those in Puerto Rico, which was
already battling an economic crisis.Many structures on Puerto Rico, including hospitals,
remain badly damaged and flooded, with clean drinking water hard to find in
some areas. Few planes have been able to land or take off from damaged
airports.http://www.reuters.com/article/us-storm-maria/puerto-rico-evacuates-area-near-crumbling-dam-asks-for-aid-idUSKCN1C02BQ?il=0
