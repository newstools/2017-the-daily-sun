SUPERSPORT United head coach Eric Tinkler will bring back his star players for their Caf Confederation Cup quarterfinal, first leg match against Zesco United at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Atteridgeville tomorrow (7pm).Tinkler rested defender Morgan Gould and midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane for their 2-0 Absa Premiership victory over struggling Platinum Stars in Tshwane on Tuesday.&nbsp;Gould was replaced by Tefu Mashamaite at centre-back but the Bafana Bafana defender is expected to return to his position tomorrow.&ldquo;I would have loved to rest most of the players who played against Stars but that is not possible,&rdquo; Tinkler said. &ldquo;We do need Morgan and Yeye fresh for the big game on Friday.&rdquo;The former Orlando Pirates and Cape Town City FC coach said they had done enough research about Zambian side Zesco and were ready for them. &ldquo;We have studied them well. They are a very good side with lots of discipline.&ldquo;Defensively they are well organised, their strikers are physically tall and have pace. They also have players who play in their national team. But we are going to get a rest midweek to prepare for them.&nbsp;&ldquo;The reality is that all quarterfinalists are quality teams. So you need to be at your best to get results and not underestimate any of them.&rdquo;The good news is that Tinkler&rsquo;s charges come into this clash on the back of four victories in all competitions and zero defeats, winning three matches and drawing one.&nbsp; &ldquo;We go into this game with a positive frame of mind and ready to fight for results.&rdquo;&nbsp;But Matsatsantsa a Pitori will be without star midfielder Sifiso Myeni, who is not registered for this competition as part of SuperSport&rsquo;s squad, having only joined them from Bidvest Wits earlier this month.
