EVEN pleas for mercy from people living with disabilities didn&rsquo;t stop the men from carrying out their fiery mission . . . The furious men allegedly stormed the house regardless and set it alight twice!It happened in Chatty in Port Elizabeth in the early hours of Friday morning.It&rsquo;s alleged the house belonged to the aunt of two men accused of robbing the taximen on Thursday night.Thobeka Wezani (60) said the taximen &ndash; said to be from the notorious northern areas &ndash; smashed her windows and ransacked her house as they looked for her two nephews.The nephews were allegedly part of a group of thugs who set up a roadblock and robbed the taximen. Residents said the taximen hunted down a man (33) and cornered him at his home in Pola Park at about 3.30am. They hacked him with pangas in the nearby bushes, set him alight and torched his home. Residents rescued him and rushed him to hospital, where he&rsquo;s said to be in a critical condition. Thobeka (60) told Daily Sun one of her nephews (30) arrived at her house crying, saying their house was on fire. &ldquo;Immediately thereafter a fleet of taxis arrived and angry taximen armed with pangas broke my windows and set my house on fire,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My neighbours rushed over and extinguished the fire. We pleaded with them not to burn down the house as I stay with two people who are living with disabilities. &ldquo;While we were arguing my nephew escaped. They became even more angry and set it on fire again. &ldquo;Again neighbours fought the flames and they eventually left, swearing at us.&rdquo;Cops spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said cops were aware of the roadblock.&ldquo;We were not aware that taxi operators raided homes,&rdquo; said Labans.
