Ward 33 Concerned Residents group leader Mthandeni Nhlapo (32) told Daily Sun: “We want proper toilets. “The MEC and the municipality want to capture us in these showers so we forget about the stinking kak.“Also, why don’t they electrify areas like Silver City and Ghana section?”Rand West City spokesman Tshidiso Tlharipe told Daily Sun: “Mashatile’s project on ablution and sanitation was to start on Tuesday.“The protest in Bekkersdal is not relevant to the project installing shower containers.”Asked why Mashatile never arrived, Tlharipe said they could not finalise arrangements with his office.“But we later made it for Friday. “This project with showers will employ many unemployed youth,” said Tlharipe.But Nhlapo was not impressed. “Somebody is going to get billions out of our naked bodies tingling inside container showers. “What will they think of next to get casual labour rather than jobs?”Resident Ntswaki Bokoto (26) said they have been washing in basins for a long time.“What we really want is a proper sewerage system.”
