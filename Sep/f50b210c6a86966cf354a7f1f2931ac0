were off to play 10 pin bowling.But disaster struck out of the blue when Simon Hartnoll
(40) parked his car on the fifth storey of a car park building, but left his
engine running and in gear. As he leant over to kiss his girlfriend (31), he
accidentally pressed his foot on the accelerator. According to New

then fell five stories to the parking lot below.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuEzq6vRvKqCu3FFKswbDTAwxG8-zYKAvKPo2aKtB1LZRjZvAWPa22BVr4EEeZtf5C4aOKD2RRRUUSVv6j8SfQ5Nmappc5mpYYOZFWD63qX_kCWa2AiZ7d5os0De7MKOzRmaH9SvV45Li2bMLpJBX8LG5NfusvQeb5srZbhIhXxC1B2vzATN37jlvhTRQd3Qn6tiQF_G9GuIIelJ-ljRwMbR0_OYd7YfSQ41qke6M1psTZyNnqw2CwCag_CwjjAmWw4sDTPpl6HOMIV636AXaD9yDOPulOe-zXgCQ\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBZLZwKXEUqzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

driving causing injury. The accident happened in March last year in Auckland.
Hartnoll suffered broken bones and spine injuries and his girlfriend serious
head injuries.Eye witness Sarah Woodhams had been removing her make up
in her flat across from the building, gazing out at the city skyline. She was
quoted in the report as saying she saw the car “sort of fly off” the side of
the building: "I've never seen anything like it before, it was so quick
and it really grabbed my attention."It shot across and went through the barrier."The car hit a Nissan parked below when it fell, but the
two women inside at the time were miraculously unhurt.
