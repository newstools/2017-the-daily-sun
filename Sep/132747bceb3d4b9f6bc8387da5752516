PRISONERS at the Boksburg prison in Ekurhuleni were injured during a fight which broke out between them and the prison warders. The scuffle followed after the prisoners had lodged a complaint about their conditions in the prison.The inmates apparently refused to go back to their cells after handing over a memorandum and being addressed.Though prison officials says no violence was used against the prisoners, families of the inmates have come out fuming claiming this is untrue.Speaking to the Peoples Paper, a teary Thandi Mahlangu (56), mother of one of the inmates who was severely beaten up, says her son was brutally beaten up until he was unconscious.He now has eleven stitches &nbsp;in his head&ldquo;I demand justice to what they have done to my son, they could have killed him."Even though he is in prison it doesn&rsquo;t mean he should be treated like an animal - i gave birth to him and he's still my son," said Mahlangu.Daily Sun contacted Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo who confirmed the incident.&ldquo;The prisoners staged a protest and handed over a memorandum which we received, but when the prisoners were taken to their cells they resisted which lead to a confrontation between the guards and the prisoners.He said the prisoner in question was allegedly beaten up because he was spitting at the officials. But he said no prisoner should be assaulted hence they are going to investigate the matter thoroughly and deal with situation accordingly.The prisoners were protesting over lack of proper sanitary equipment and that they are being forced to work at the workshop against their will.
