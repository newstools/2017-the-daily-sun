WHEN residents of Extension 22 in Nellmapius, east of Tshwane, saw construction workers installing pylons, they thought that they were getting electricity.That was in January, but today they are still waiting. Nyaope smokers who wait to offload rubbish trucks going to a nearby landfill have found a way to use the pylons. They have turned one of them into a shelter. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvTVbJr5oKujjBVnZlU-NxLuCTahhku3NGSvJZNCx2EC-eUknEZfzqa1r3O02YWFBKHhr5l3V_b2l_fFr68ONQTbO25-K5XkGzOfgE3NW0fqzOIpZzW5A0Lv1Btk2ksjQKvDa6HEGDuzGREBs_Q9vjFJNwicv8-xI5oUo8dl8kZUxqq5wiTHwkVWgnODemgeR0OAJYLOZqDGeJ8UxT1bJWnm4t3slgbbZjiSFtjExa8T_QCSCfm4Yt9eVFVpVYtdKdmac8zBr9ArHCQahamMGYAGdQgMdY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAnXb2WfXnVsEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Resident Martha Mabati (40) said the nyaope smokers will delay the electrification of their area. She said authorities should get rid of them. “They don’t want to see anything that is made of metal lying around. The pylons will soon end up in some scrapyard,” she said. However, a nyaope smoker who only identified himself as Baby Shoes said they would never chop a pylon into pieces. “We too need electricity and we would never do anything to delay it.” Daily Sun contacted councillor Joel Masilela who said the project was delayed because the first contractor went bankrupt. “Construction has resumed and soon the pylons will be standing.”
