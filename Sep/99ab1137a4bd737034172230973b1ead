He had an opportunity to score a hat-trick but I gave him the penalty as well. . . What you want is to win the game and not to take any gambles because if they come back to 2-1, it can be nervy.”Arsenal face BATE Borisov in Belarus in the Europa League tonight before hosting Brighton and Hove Albion in the league on Sunday. Meanwhile, Tony Pulis was left fuming with referee Robert Madley after West Brom were denied a “stonewall’ penalty against Arsenal, and labelled Alexis Sanchez a “cheat”.West Brom were denied a clear penalty in the eighth minute when Shkodran Mustafi tripped Jay Rodriguez, only for Rodriguez to get himself up and hit the post.Madley did not signal for advantage during the move, while Pulis also referenced an early free-kick awarded to Arsenal, where he believed Sanchez dived and should have been booked. – ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY SKY SPORTS
