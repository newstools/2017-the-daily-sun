GUESS who’s back?Yes, Kaizer Chiefs and Itumeleng Khune are back to their best form and conquering the PSL. And the man driving the Amakhosi bus is none other than Steve “Koloi” Komphela, who has now become the darling of club supporters.Chiefs have not lost any of their last three matches, most recently teaching Maritzburg United a lesson with two goals without reply, following their 1-1 draw with Bidvest Wits and a 2-0 demolition of Cape Town City FC.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstIfQnSxPJ95zrMz2DO2SfMD21B75taijEa2pvbgVqGmGRtAQCbNK6VxzpnfUdjQmn7uI_gjAtUf2FcwbsazZtLQu0qwGdDEP_CUW9v7O2y_5wSKz74EYppLn1fURNQsTRZbrxFazFO1c7uk1qJPEiB9gcp8pl6tQRZboAyEqt866YFZkijibgMkq8h2I3cxg4Rz6fg9XxrMr3SZ9IZNXqFAxFlt3j31XuzgJIUYkkZyjbn2mHftcQmUo5B8n8lDNlnZzkZhvE7CSNd0QUrnAKByw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNJR_pn4CcHVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We also had Shabba and Paez running the whole match. It’s pleasing to see senior players step up like that. But you expect that from them – if they don’t, who will?”Khune was the rock that blocked the way for Maritzburg’s strikers and deservedly walked way with the Man of the Match prize.But Komphela reckons Abafana Bes’thende, who bagged full points against struggling Platinum Stars (1-0), will be a tough nut to crack. He said his charges would have to dig deep if they were to blunt the sharp Arrows, who won three matches in a row, against deteriorating Wits, AmaZulu and now Dikwena.Said Komphela: “Arrows team are intelligent and well organised. We will have to double our efforts against them.”
