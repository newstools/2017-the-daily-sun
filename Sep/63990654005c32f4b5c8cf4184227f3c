Dear MizzB&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 18 years old and my girlfriend is 16. The problem is that she doesn&rsquo;t want to fall pregnant. Her mum is moving to another province with her and I believe if I were to make her pregnant, she&rsquo;d be forced to live here with her gogo so I could still have her.&nbsp; -&thinsp;Thando&nbsp;READ: FIND YOUR FIRE AND EXPLODE!Dear Thando Getting a 16-year-old girl pregnant is a bad idea! She has a right to say no because of the huge responsibility that comes with raising a child, especially when you&rsquo;re still young. Both of you are young and have a future to consider, instead of thinking about a baby.&nbsp; You should encourage each other on the importance of education. Having a baby at a young age could delay your dreams and aspirations. You can send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 to speak to one of our counsellors.&nbsp;
