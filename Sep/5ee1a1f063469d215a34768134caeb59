CHILDREN have too many rights!This is the cry from gatvol teachers at Dalrose Primary School in Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay.About 40 teachers at the school, which has about 1 200 pupils, said the pupils were the cause of all their troubles. Speaking to Daily Sun yesterday, they said the pupils were out of control and that bullying, gangsterism and drug abuse was rife.The teachers said the latest incident involved a fight between two boys aged 10 and 11 on Wednesday morning.&ldquo;The younger boy was stabbed seven times in his upper body with scissors,&rdquo; said a shocked teacher.&ldquo;The parents of both the boys were called in and seem to have made peace.&rdquo;The principal told the father of the younger boy he shouldn&rsquo;t blame the school. &ldquo;The wounds were not so deep, but it is just one of the incidents we have been forced to endure.&rdquo;Another gatvol teacher said: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t punish these kids because they have so many rights. We aren&rsquo;t allowed to hit them. Instead we give them verbal and written warnings.&rdquo;She said recently a naughty pupil was told to pick up litter around the school but his parents claimed it was child labour.Principal Larry de la Harpe said there were no psychiatrists or psychologists at his school. &ldquo;We are in the process of putting up CCTV cameras. We asked parents to pay R100 towards buying these, but only a few of them have come forward.&rdquo; Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said no cases had been opened.Eastern Cape Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said department officials had the right to ask police to search pupils for weapons.
