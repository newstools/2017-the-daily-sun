about who should be held responsible.Department of Labour spokesperson Teboho Thejane said the
department had set up a Section 32 inquiry following the collapse to uncover
the reason for the collapse of the scaffolding.Thejane said the inquiry would be chaired by Lennie Samuel.According to the department, stakeholders include the Joburg
Municipality as the client, the Joburg Development Agency as the agent, Murray
and Roberts Infrastructure as the principal contractor and Form-Scaff as a
contractor.More witnesses will still be called and the inquiry should
conclude its business by the end of September 2018, said Thejane.
