INCONSISTENCY could prove to be University of Pretoria’s biggest enemy.And head coach Shaun Bartlett is aware that his National First Division (NFD) side has been blowing hot and cold in the league in the four rounds of matches already played.AmaTuks are in their second stint in the NFD and have not shown any signs of urgency to make a return to the PSL at the end of the current season.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>They finished in a disappointing 11th position last season. What has been causing sleepless nights for the former TV analyst is the win-lose attitude, which puts him under immense pressure since his mandate this season is to return the club to the Absa Premiership. In the four matches played so far, they have won two, drawn one and lost one. “We did not start well. If you want to be a champion you must get the results all the time,” said Bartlett. They next visit Witbank Spurs at Mpumalanga’s Puma Rugby Stadium tomorrow (3pm), where they will be hoping to collect the three points. Spurs won both matches home and away last season, defeating AmaTuks 4-0 and 2-0 respectively. Bartlett, who got Golden Arrows promoted from the NFD to the PSL a few seasons ago, said: “We learnt some valuable lessons last season.” The NFD action starts later today when Stellenbosch FC host Cape Town All Stars in a Cape Town derby at Athlone Stadium (3pm). Meanwhile Ubuntu FC, Richards Bay FC and Royal Eagles will all be searching for their first victory of the season in their respective fixtures this weekend.
