ANOTHER exam was disrupted at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology&rsquo;s Cape Town campus yesterday.A group of students demonstrated against the presence of private security guards on campus and issues relating to insourcing.Cleaners and security guards did not report for duty and headed to the Bellville campus, where they expected to sign their new contracts. Police were called to disperse the protestors. A protest leader said: &ldquo;The institution wants a war with the students and they will get one. &ldquo;We are being victimised for fighting for a genuine cause.&rdquo;Acting vice-chancellor Dr Chris Nhlapo said: &ldquo;There are reports of a small group of protesting students attacking private security guards and attempting to clear buildings with force. &ldquo;Our understanding is that the tension is related to the removal of private security on campus and an insistence by student leaders that insourced workers leave their posts and travel to Bellville campus to sign their contracts. &ldquo;This was done even though they were instructed not to leave their work stations because their contracts would be signed at their respective campuses.&rdquo;He said much of the tension was linked to the fact that four student leaders were suspended on Wednesday and are now no longer allowed on any of the university&rsquo;s campuses.&ldquo;The suspension comes after they were accused of continued involvement in campus disruptions. &ldquo;The decision to suspend these students was taken after several attempts at reconciliation were snubbed. The disruption of the academic programme and the damage to university property can no longer be condoned.&rdquo;In an effort to secure the safety of all staff and students, private security remains in place across the university and this will continue until the situation has returned to normal. The university said it would take disciplinary action against all the workers who left their work stations.
