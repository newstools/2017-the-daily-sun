The area falls under the Nyanga Community Policing Forum (CPF). CPF chairman Martin Makasi said domestic violence was a serious problem in the community."It is very rare that a couple would be murdered. Normally it is either a husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend," he said.  "One might assume there was an intruder who surprised them, or some sort of love triangle thing."Residents believed the killer was a former boyfriend of the woman who had threatened to kill the couple numerous times, said Sitshitsi.She said they claimed he was seen with blood-spattered clothing, and when questioned he said he had been in a fight.The bodies were apparently discovered soon after.Residents proceeded to beat up a man they thought was responsible for the crimes.Van Wyk confirmed that a 35-year-old man was arrested and taken to hospital for treatment of his injuries.He will appear in Athlone Magistrate's Court soon on murder charges.
