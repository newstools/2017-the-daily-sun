THE mother of four siblings who were found dead in their home will be charged with child negligence. The department of social development released a statement saying that they will be laying a charge of negligence against the mother (30) of the four children from Kwanzimakwe, in Port Edward, KZN. The mother allegedly admitted to leaving the children alone in the house on several occasions while she went boozing with her friends. On Saturday, the four children &ndash; Lwandle (4), Siphindile (8), Lwandile (10) and Bandile (12) Mbhele &ndash; were found lying dead on the bed with stab wounds. Some had their left ears cut off. Social development MEC Weziwe Thusi paid a visit to the family on Wednesday and said most social ills were an indication that residents had abandoned their responsibilities to look after each other. &ldquo;Please report incidents of child neglect to end abuse so that we can take proper action to protect them and bring those responsible to book.&rdquo;Thusi said the department has also activated its trauma response teams to offer psycho-social support to the family and neighbours.The children&rsquo;s uncle, Ben Mbhele (34), said the children will be buried on Sunday. &ldquo;The department of social development has promised to assist us for the funeral costs,&rdquo; said Mbhele. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the matter is still under investigation. &ldquo;Once the investigation is completed, the docket will be taken to court for a decision on whether to prosecute her or not.&rdquo;
