A 34-YEAR-OLD mum wants the Western Cape Education Department to take action against a teacher who allegedly called her daughter a magosha.The teacher apparently insulted the grade 9 pupil after she caught her looking at herself in a mirror during an English lesson last Tuesday.&ldquo;She came back home crying and locked herself in her room, refusing to speak to anyone. &ldquo;My daughter said a classmate told her there was something on her mouth and she looked at herself in the mirror to wipe it off,&rdquo; the mum told Daily Sun.&ldquo;The teacher told her she was looking at herself in the mirror as if she was a magosha.&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s friends confirmed that the teacher compared her to a magosha. The mum said she confronted the teacher about the incident.&ldquo;The teacher begged me not to tell the principal because she might lose her job. &ldquo;She said sometimes the kids behaved badly and she said things she didn&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; said the mum.&ldquo;When I approached the principal, she said she was busy and promised to look into the matter this week. But the damage has been done because other kids tease my child. &ldquo;Now boys ask my daughter things like &lsquo;how much&rsquo; when they see her outside the classroom, while girls call her a magosha. &ldquo;My daughter is too young to experience this kind of behaviour.&rdquo; Jessica Shelver, spokeswoman for the education department, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Our district office is not aware of the alleged incident, but we will investigate. &ldquo;Meanwhile, we recommend that the parent of the pupil reports the alleged incident to the principal.&rdquo;
