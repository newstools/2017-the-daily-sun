AN AMERICAN couple are feeling divinely blessed after
seeing Jesus looking over their unborn child in the womb.Parents Alicia Zeek and Zac Smith were amazed when they
saw the unmistakeable features of Jesus Christ next to their baby girl during
an ultrasound.According to BBC, the couple said that Jesus was dressed
in his traditional robes with a crown of thorns on his head. He was in the far
left of the sonogram, facing the baby.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssuQsl_RJ3RNbaMHsTRbHLZ7maZ-rv162TeK0q1wkdbY6LAPFbYfbRVgDwrK0lpifGtrszlehER_sJ9d54bQ5fg2utZkVy9L3eAt8zhQhikWLYTjv4Ew_uldcE1fWP2A9-EH8WctTn51YbjnHTY4w_DAKJrFY0jyK80GOX79_1IweZDIqP-GizYQUtJb8JRFzSxhytxlcyC2eXlB-iGVDe-yv0w1QYT17XuZqIJ8-OAiy3Vk0PLDHCLk9vl0efp8v5_gHUblBXs50RigLyIsIPO6Lw12RNZ1tEG7g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIllUVRMS-K_EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

it looks like Jesus,” Alicia told local station WPMT.What made the revelation so important to them is that the
couple’s two older kids both had medical issues and they were anxious about the
new one.The couple told Fox 43 that their first baby girl was
born with two thumbs on one hand. Their baby boy was born with a cleft palate
(a split in the palate of the mouth)."The angel or God or Jesus, however you want to propose
it, I look at it as my blessing," Zac was quoted as saying."When I seen it, it almost brought tears to my eyes.
I was speechless, I just couldn't believe it."A healthy Baby Briella was born on 23 August. Mum and
baby are both doing well.
