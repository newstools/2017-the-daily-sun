ADVOCATES representing President Jacob Zuma and the NPA yesterday admitted it was irrational not to prosecute him on corruption charges. Advocate Kemp J Kemp, representing Zuma in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein, told a full bench of judges he believed former NPA head Mokotedi Mpshe made a mistake by not prosecuting Zuma. Zuma and the NPA have approached the court to appeal a decision by the North Gauteng High Court last year to overturn the NPA&rsquo;s decision to drop corruption charges against him. Advocate Hilton Epstein, representing the NPA, faced tough questions from the visibly unimpressed judges, who wanted to know who had decided whether or not to prosecute Zuma. Epstein argued the timing of the charges against Zuma were aimed at manipulating who would become president of South Africa after Thabo Mbeki. The 18 charges against Zuma were withdrawn in 2009, just before he was sworn in for his first term as president. Justice Mahomed Navsa said the decision not to prosecute Zuma needed to be weighed up against the public interest. The DA last year took the matter to court to have the charges reinstated. Last year, judges overturned the NPA&rsquo;s decision to drop charges against Zuma that related to fraud, racketeering and money laundering. Both the NPA and Zuma turned to the Appeal Court after the High Court denied them direct access for an appeal. Both parties said the DA&rsquo;s claims that the court could overturn the decision was offensive to both the National Director of Public Prosecutions and the NPA.&ndash; NEWS24
