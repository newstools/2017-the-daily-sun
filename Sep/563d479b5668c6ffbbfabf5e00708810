there will be a crises. If that happens, there will be a crises," Mantashe
said at a church event on Sunday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvKpHxnEWY0DfP0vnsT2mdy8BttSPu3srim72tXZ5dBouq18MZOeW_iaqHjLJGQo3TG0cMx1RNxMC9UB4aJ3wWiQWGLotl-BPOQ8QR6ykVaYEy8CMnZk-yGuilRz5zAuIG9WJuu8tdMMyKqC8CMHAfuSxcP9m1zqMnUqkT_tbCvbAC1KY1LnPglyj_XNj53eD9DQxlegcPbEDrz_0v2is_hAosz82luHAgpiGXkqDaaC6QMjCvOBMKDrVepkvRhOP8g-3PaFdvGS-jhSU_XXudlAlMBd9s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO1dEE6cVyvbEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

have a woman Deputy President. That will be smooth. That is my personal advice
#HeritageDay."He said the ANC "will never elect a woman
President", but rather elect an ANC president, whether male or female.Mantashe's comments found criticism in some quarters of
the party. ANC KZN chairman, Sihle Zikalala said Mantashe's position required a
leader who did not hold a "one-sided view".Mthembu, a known supporter of Ramaphosa's claim to the
presidency, defended Mantashe on Tuesday."@GwedeMantashe1, the SG of the ANC, like all ANC
members, has every right to pronounce on his preference for ANC
President," he tweeted."I am with @GwedeMantashe1 and all those who support
the time-tested ANC tradition of a deputy president becoming an ANC President.
#SIYAVUMA 100%!!"Mantashe responded to the criticism on Sunday, saying
President Jacob Zuma had made his choice of candidate known to the public, and
thus he too had the right to do so. In his speech on Sunday, Mantashe alluded
to the make-or-break choice facing the ruling party over the next three months,
hinting that the battle for the presidency was going to get ugly."Pray for us, so that we choose life and prosperity
in December, not death," he said."Your prayers will help us, because this period is
going to be characterised by betrayal. That is what we are going to see,
leading to December."We must never ascend to power by destroying others.
We ask that the church pray for us. We pray that you pray for the ANC," he
finished. http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mantashe-has-every-right-to-back-ramaphosa-for-president-mthembu-20170926
