ZIMBABWE protest pastor Evan Mawarire spent a second
night in police custody yesterday, awaiting his appearance at the Harare
magistrates' court on charges of trying to subvert the government.Mawarire was arrested at his church on Sunday, a day after
he went online to urge Zimbabweans to take action to stop the country's
worsening economic crisis. He talked about the panic buying in Harare, and the
reemergence of fuel queues, which he said showed the situation was urgent.Yesterday, he pleaded not guilty at the Harare High Court
at the start of his trial on an earlier charge of subversion. That charge stems
from anti-government demonstrations he helped to organise last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst_y2LuYQ9-bRusDaqd-a5q50yXt5HlTthAyPoAEC-hE5hPVkCODpWpZoI8dfh_qhrfMP5HEE6TGmb4-SHJqS5pKEPfoUwNXgDSn8pKjfrBC53SK11tdTgvSpfZoFpOSb_YXWtGyhvUn1Ll89jeBrBYzoqeG-KRSpGNWMbTRXnk7Dd0kS9knTIOdwY9zSnr7vPED3r2MFwJZJz_cEAfhjIVFbdv_hWnDOPoSgI2oYvd7NSt7lqKUj-u1gzAczVnjGb1gafVABMmZZnWIeRyodElyuFTBlMp9TNC9g\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFEcBf4Pt-nREAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
