    WHEN people heard their chief was meeting foreign visitors on Saturday, they saw it as a chance to make her listen to their grievances. They made their way to Phylia Nwamitwa’s office and burnt tyres outside, demanding that she leave her meeting to speak to them. The situation soon became tense and residents started burning objects and barricading the road outside the chief’s home in Nwamitwa Village, outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstflqhuNDByjOxtrX3r61nXWX2cxtYgGNdXuT1q_2usV1AXN8iM7UPWZebR-9NkOGZUUJHrE3AhHRS4XLwRqbV5jc4LuVWZkWnHA-Xo5CQpjNrpUTZaWBtK_pwMa9lyhzddH-YsX2BuR06dNvDMxMQgsA4ZoYlCByr5yvWgV2-XfZR7QUXhmQ2gG9_NlXZyjjpOiJ6v_eSLi8bXFTQZZq6FJtTVvlL5m09uMXHRv5x5xIXvW0nLEVoVJ7LvjEdu_nOCeyArtgZMcsKwC43f1NzVhO0sHog\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFkkivAWfQAKEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But the chief didn’t come out to meet them and the cops dispersed the crowd with rubber bullets.Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said: “After the residents first gathered, we went to the illegal meeting and dispersed them peacefully. “However, they later regrouped. We are on the trail of individuals who were involved in incidents of public violence and malicious damage to property.” Mojapelo said the windows of two vehicles parked inside the premises of the tribal office were smashed. He said police are still investigating reports that one person was injured. There were rumours that residents were planning another protest in the area, but it was not known whether they would be targeting the chief again. “We are aware that they want to regroup. Public order policing members have been sent to the area to monitor the situation,” said Mojapelo.
