KENYAN president Uhuru Kenyatta has described the court
ruling that the country’s 8 August elections were unlawful as a “coup by four
people sitting in court” and a judicial dictatorship.This is according to the Daily Nation.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuySQQlvjA-nhw4USLUxbR7oea_oBUdGoHmCgzTFMSRH096o_rZCojkhuhmrobnJEA3Deb_mpEuBbZTKuVwNyg5H9fGvAXnEej03nVBbN9BO0eEkproI14ULMbaQwIYloRMw0Uac-wmiG3a05w8gi9I9-r6LiqMU49F6LWaCe7n5JF6--QI9G91vmBFo8A0DTvF_WjrM7rZ4UQoiBzECapxf3MXqQNgZtmDHC-GZu-nGIAHiRbitjB_S-1EKnQ3ySJquY2HH-OHAcsU4uEs_UqbDnqCVt1FJNhHWg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzChPJ0XSr16tEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

explained why the judges had rejected the results of August’s election and
ordered that the elections be rerun within 60 days.The date of 17 October has provisionally been set, but
many fear the issues that have plagued the electoral commission won’t be solved
by then. This will put the results of new elections in doubt too.Speaking in Nairobi today, Kenyatta was quoted as saying:
“This was a coup…I must call it what it is ... This is a voice of a few, who on
their own decided they can choose a leader for the majority of Kenyans. If this
is not dictatorship, I don’t what it is. “The judgment has
shown the voice of the people matters no more. What matters is the voice of a
few people, who arrogate to themselves powers they don’t have.” Kenyatta argued that the judges should just have ordered
a recount, rather than fresh elections.The judges found a number of irregularities and illegal
actions in their investigation into August’s elections, mainly to do with the
country’s new electronic voting system.Despite his damning comments about the judiciary,
Kenyatta maintains he respects the court’s decision. He added that the courts
are “lucky they are dealing with a polite man, who respects the constitution
and is not interested in seeing Kenyans fight”.
