was leaving the road, a bus ploughed into it, causing the bakkie to run over three officers and into a stationary vehicle,” he said.The bus stopped just a few meters from the crash site.The three cops were then rushed to hospital but sadly, one lost his life on the way. Then the driver of the bus was
arrested on charges of reckless driving.“This is very sad as
this is the second officer we lost in seven days,” said Minaar.Minaar urged drivers
to be more vigilant when driving on the road.“Drivers are
reckless and lives are taken very lightly. "We need to take a
tough stance in bringing this to an end,” he said.
