My shack has been destroyed and a big tree bends over the shack. If it falls down, it will destroy me and my shack forever,” he said.Patrick’s life in the shack started in 2015.He said a local councillor told him to find other accommodation until his RDP was approved, but nothing has happened since.Patrick could suffocate or be attacked in the old Cortina.He said he needs an RDP house so he can live a decent life with his girlfriend (57).Neighbour Tshidi Motsoelwa said: “That big tree nearly killed madala. He is better off in the car but there’s no guarantee of his safety.”Tshidi said neighbours lent him a radio. “You hear him singing in the car at night.”Passerby Siphokazi Nyembe said: “I think the elder needs help to get an RDP.”Patrick said he would love an RDP.Human Settlements spokesman Keith Khoza said the madala is in the queue. “As long as he is on the waiting list, he must be patient. He will get his house,” said Khoza.
