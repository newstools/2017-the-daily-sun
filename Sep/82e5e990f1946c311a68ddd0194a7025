WHENEVER the power was on at her house, Queen Patty needed to work quickly to make sure all her food was cooked. But what hurt her the most was that she could no longer follow her favourite soapie, Generations: The Legacy. The 51-year-old from Eldorado Park, Joburg, told Daily Sun an electrical box near her home exploded two months ago and that her life has been a struggle ever since. It took many complaints for it to be fixed. City Power spokesman Virgil James said technicians had now been sent to fix the problem. Queen told the People&rsquo;s Paper the story of how she and three other residents on her street were affected by the issue. She said the box exploded suddenly, and ever since then, the four houses had constantly been experiencing power cuts. Daily Sun is in possession of a video in which the box explodes. Queen said every time the electrical switch in the box tripped, she had to put it back on with a long stick. She said she knew it was dangerous but there was nothing else she could do. Her neighbour Lettie Nel (45) said: &ldquo;One time, a small baby living in the street turned blue in the face because there wasn&rsquo;t power for her oxygen mask. We rushed her to hospital. We cannot live like this any more.&rdquo;
