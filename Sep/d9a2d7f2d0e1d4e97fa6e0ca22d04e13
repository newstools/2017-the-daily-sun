A SANGOMA who sells vetkoek is accused of poisoning four friends at Joe Slovo squatter camp in Langa, Cape Town.Three of the boys, Athule Makonzi (15), Mzingisi Gwebecimele (17) and Khanyisa Mthamzeli (17) died over the weekend, while Athabile Loyeli (15) is fighting for his life in hospital.Athule was in grade 9 at Kulani Secondary School. His aunt, Buyelwa Makonzi (30), said he died crying in pain.&ldquo;He complained of stomach pain and a burning chest. He said he was burning and asked us to pour water over him.&rdquo;Buyelwa said Athule starting vomiting on Saturday night. She said the clothes he was wearing changed colour after he vomited on them, as if acid had been poured over them. &ldquo;We are still waiting for the woman who sold them the vetkoek on Saturday night to explain what happened.&rdquo; The teens were last seen playing pool together on Saturday. Two of them died on Saturday and the other on Sunday.When Daily Sun visited sangoma Ntombizikhona Mbheshu (35), she denied poisoning the boys. She said she was afraid because people were calling her a murderer.She said she heard people talking outside her shack saying they&rsquo;d burn and kill her.&ldquo;Cops came and took all the ingredients I used to make my vetkoek. I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong and I didn&rsquo;t kill those boys.&rdquo;Ntombizikhona said she would never do anything that would negatively affect her business because it helps her put food on the table.&ldquo;I want to meet the boys&rsquo; families and tell my side of the story, but I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said an inquest docket has been opened for investigation after three boys, aged from 15 to 17, died. &ldquo;An attempted murder case is under investigation for the surviving victim of the incident,&rdquo; she said.
