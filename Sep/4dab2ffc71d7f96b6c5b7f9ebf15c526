JOBURG taximen could soon be cruising in bus lanes without worrying about the cops. Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba has instructed the city’s transport department to investigate ways in which the taxi industry could be allowed to use the bus lanes. Acting director of mayoral communications Luyanda Mfeka said allowing taxis in the lanes could be a way to improve the speed and reliability of public transport in Joburg. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsszMJsOuKiZun5UAnS023o3m4Ik7Cip77DcG3lZS3FarkxOlWF5Z0a1g3fqMk6xeEmIuKXo-okH6lEXnnk6NyiW1tRolCrq-PHcuQrlujvHL1YZEY6ezY5DVqSI6JRsnrytIn1tLbIrEYXVJe_J7MfA6TcFnRqcxkiFQveKI9Mq8REEWmkYym-x_3orIKplpaJmlU0lfHRegCYhQs5z-9CYlSRYRqRDFB87uKm9x3oUCXLI4pDNHxl4y7O7xss1n0LTIifCWo49gFp8MZOg9RvMo7w3UD4\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHWKqYbd0kDzEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

However, the mayor’s decision does not mean taxis can use the bus lanes yet. Mfeka said investigations needed to be conducted before lanes could be dedicated to any particular form of public transport. “We already have in place a number of dedicated or managed lanes and are implementing and investing in more,” said Mfeka. He said the Sandton public transport loop, which started operating on a pilot basis on Monday, had a lane dedicated to all forms of public transport, including taxis and buses. On Tuesday Mashaba and representatives of different public transport operators met at Marks Park in Joburg and signed an agreement to work together to transform transport between the Joburg CBD, Alexandra, Sandton, Midrand and Ivory Park.Among those who signed were Santaco, Top Six Taxi Management, minibus taxi associations from the affected areas, Putco and JR Choeu.
