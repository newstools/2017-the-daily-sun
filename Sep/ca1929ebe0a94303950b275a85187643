SIX SPACES filled, 26 left&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp; &nbsp;That is the carrot Fifa has dangled in front of football nations who have not yet booked a spot at the 2018 Russia World Cup.&nbsp;One of those nations is South Africa, regarded as having the best resourced national football team in Africa and as the most financially stable of the 56 member associations of the Confederation of African Football (Caf).Bafana Bafana are itching to claim one of those 26 spaces still available. Hosts Russia, Iran, Mexico, Japan, Brazil and Belgium have already qualified. Now it&rsquo;s other teams&rsquo; turn to prove themselves.Bafana striker Bradley Grobler has vowed that they will put up a better display tonight when they face Cape Verde in the return leg of their World Cup qualifier. The match, billed for Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium, kicks off at 7pm.&nbsp;The SuperSport United man admitted they were far from their best in their 2-1 defeat to the Blue Sharks in the first leg on Friday.&nbsp;Said Grobler: &ldquo;We were not sharp enough. I think we missed out on a big opportunity to go top of our group, especially after Saturday&rsquo;s result between Senegal and Burkina Faso (a draw). Obviously we&rsquo;ve learnt from our mistakes. We had a meeting on Saturday. All the guys are still in good spirits.&rdquo;Grobler, who entered the game early in the second half on Friday, said they were professionals and would bounce back.&nbsp;The 29-year-old, who could start ahead of misfiring Lebogang Manyama tonight, concurs that this return leg is make or break for Bafana.&nbsp;After this match Bafana will be left with two qualifiers, a home game against Burkina Faso and an away game in Senegal.
