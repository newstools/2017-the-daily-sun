    A South African Rugby World Cup in 2023 would be an unbeatable triple-win, the World Rugby Council was told in London on Monday, when SA Rugby made their case to host the 10th Rugby World Cup tournament.A South African Rugby World Cup would be a win for the sport, a win for supporters and most importantly a win for the players, delegates were told in a 50-minute presentation led by the Deputy President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, and including the Minister of Sport and Recreation, Thulas Nxesi.“South Africa ticks every single box of the financial, commercial and logistical requirements of the host, but we go way beyond the minimum requirements to set us apart as a candidate,” said Jurie Roux, CEO of SA Rugby.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss174qBgfeYxNUkfbTLwTYXuormXdsEm9OOYnDTsj4Euq3f7o6MMq4QQ8hyKvkLkqgrJbawZTZFMO9Xhd-D_VVtxy5ubsnGJTDXtqOw6TKc0d9LlYNW_jyVGNcHJYbM1sUhgVDMGeKfESqJrFi7-7V7nKaLYhGPpB7DRr0V2SeMblcWJkVPo-JZbNy2_zPlehxPT2qES528vorrw3Nq2kI172Hrqzmc9-zoN50zG-atHDEdjMuINPv59yMVUQjwxVEWK5Aw_3WPb-syxpLY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzPxZVzgJz7z2EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We have proven we can deliver.”Sports Minister, Thulas Nxesi, said: “South Africa’s bid is simple. We promise to make World Rugby proud by hosting an unforgettable celebration of rugby that delivers on every single bid requirement.“We don’t need to build new stadia or upgrade old ones; we don’t need to find hotel rooms and you don’t need to worry about the guarantees. We don’t need to pass new legislation. Every last detail of the required specification is already in place.“We have a deep and burning desire to host this tournament – not just for South Africa but for rugby.  We want to share our passion with the world and provide the sport with a carnival that’s vibrantly African, which will engulf our country, capture a continent and inspire the world.”South Africa is bidding against Ireland and France for the rights to host the tournament. Rugby World Cup Ltd will announce their preferred candidate on 31 October. That recommendation will be put to a vote of the World Rugby Council on 15 November.
