I could not go inside because it was scary.“When I woke up, I felt he was in trouble, so I decided to visit his grave. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the damaged tombstone. I believe someone was trying to steal it but failed because it is strong. Unfortunately, it broke.” She said the family will decide whether to slaughter a goat to bring him peace.Ethekwini head of parks and recreation, Thembinkosi Ngcobo, said the municipality cannot be held responsible for the damaged tombstone. “The family has to protect their graves by fencing them.” SA Traditional Healers Association president Sazi Mhlongo said Zibambeleni must see a sangoma, who should perform a ceremony to bring her dead son peace. “It could be that no one was trying to steal the tombstone but it was damaged because her son was angry. She must consult a sangoma and slaughter a goat.”
