THESE livestock owners used to live in fear of their animals being stolen. But Thomas Matsomane (72) claims he has found muthi that makes animals fight off stock thieves!Thomas, who sells the muthi, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;They kick the person who wants to take them and refuse to go. Even if they are captured and taken away, they will find their way home.&rdquo; Thomas, from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun his muthi works on all kinds of livestock, including cows and sheep. &ldquo;You mix the muthi with the animal feed. You also speak to the animals and instruct them not to allow a stranger to take them away,&rdquo; he said. Thomas said he got the recipe for the muthi from San people in Botswana. &ldquo;I was a truck driver and one day I got stuck in the middle of nowhere in Botswana. A group of San people came to me and asked if I needed help,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We had a lengthy conversation about how they live and they told me about their secret recipe for protecting livestock. They told me where to go and dig up the roots needed to make the muthi.&rdquo;Thulani Gama from KZN is one of Thomas&rsquo; happy customers. He said he bought the muthi in June and gave it to his 36 goats. &ldquo;They were stolen three weeks ago but last week they all came back home.&rdquo; Mhlekazi Daniel, from the Eastern Cape, said not one of his cows had been stolen since he started using Thomas&rsquo; muthi last year. Lipson Mphahlele, from Limpopo, also said he had not had any trouble with stock theft since he started using the muthi.
