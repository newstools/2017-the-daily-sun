PEOPLE welcomed the news that new houses were on the way with joy and celebration.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are happy our needs will finally be recognised,&rdquo; residents of N17&nbsp;squatter camp, in Springs, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun.Residents were told they would be part of a mega-settlement project aimed at delivering over 16&thinsp;000 houses in the next five years. The housing project was launched by Gauteng Premier David Makhura at Daggafontein, Ekurhuleni. He said there would be six mega-housing infrastructure projects, during which 7&thinsp;500 temporary jobs would be created and local businesses would benefit.&ldquo;Ekurhuleni has a large housing backlog in the 119 informal settlements. The six projects will help give direction for the city.&rdquo; The premier pleaded with&nbsp;members of the community not&nbsp;to vandalise or burn property when they are unhappy with service&nbsp;delivery. Martha Mahlangu (43) said since she moved to the area as a 13-year-old, she had hoped that one day she would be able to turn on the lights in her own house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy the area will be developed and electricity will be installed soon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lungelo Mthembu (27) said: &ldquo;Since I finished my matric, I&rsquo;ve been struggling to get a job. I&rsquo;m happy the project will create job opportunities.&ldquo;All these years of struggling for service delivery and basics such as&nbsp;toilets are coming to an end.&rdquo;
