The Harry Oppenheimer Gardens is one of the oldest historical
sites in Kimberley.Previously known as the Malay Camp, it was a cosmopolitan suburb
which was subject to forced removals due to the Group Areas Act.It housed members of a diversity of cultures and ethnic entities
from around the world who came to Kimberley to stake a claim in the diamond
rush.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssKTfDaWZunNes2CZFQP3uPPnakHDS5amXta4DlUhi4ISBbIccGTJqFyXjsOKkwPJJ7vxkEOqZvlBHc8quAC0lZd2GHhq8CIT6RVmdRxEWJkQGkQLEtpJgCfCegaVEOxYH_QvTfPdZWJIjlpalgwhzj_PWqoatcjETXso_psyxxw5K867jhtF6nZmoxdbUKrw4VENd87WNER48VMxQgVodsxWkzKMUC3wD4ansvGGf1D9L9_eTPNowKp3wh7WKa0WkMxVZD6Z5Dt9SQggI-OeItC-q0Uzg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNE_OWfewruxEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

post office, the Market Square, the William Humphreys Art Gallery and the Sol
Plaatje University (SPU), as well as what used to be the William Pescod
Education Institution, a former “coloured only” learning institution.The Department of Sport, Arts and Culture, the Sol Plaatje
Municipality and the National Heritage Council organised a Cultural and
Heritage March, in the form of a cultural parade, to historic sites in
Kimberley which have strong significance regarding heritage.Held on Wednesday (13/09), the parade reflected on historic sites
in order for participants who come from from a diverse background to understand
where we are today and who we truly are.It was also part of celebrating Heritage Month and the build-up
towards the Golden Shield Heritage Awards (Gosha) held on Friday (15/09).The awards are held annually to recognise and honour those who
have contributed to the preservation, protection and the promotion of South
African heritage.Gosha celebrates excellence specifically in the heritage sector
under the theme “Celebrating Cultural and Heritage Champions in the 100 years
of Oliver Tambo”.To many, the parade was a reminder not to lose sight of their
heritage. It also taught them how the different strands of history have
influenced and shaped them to become who they were, and what it meant to be
free.Starting at the Oppenheimer Gardens, the parade moved through
Eureka Street, into Lennox Street and into De Beers Street.De Beers Street was chosen as a reference to the mining giants
that monopolised the diamond mining industry in Kimberley and later the gold
industry in the country.From here the parade proceeded towards Phakamile Mabija Road,
which used to be divided into Transvaal Road (which became the N12, and used to
lead straight to the old Transvaal Republic) and Jones Street (named after
William Thomas Jones, who had owned a pub called the Old Clock in Market Square
Street).It was renamed to honour the struggle stalwart who had been thrown
to his death from the sixth floor of the Special Branch Police Station housed
in the same street.The parade also passed by the statue of Frances Baard, who was
born in Beaconsfield in 1909 and joined the ANC in 1948 when apartheid was
legalised. She was part of the drafting of the Freedom Charter in 1955 and
also of the 1956 Women’s March.She was banished, jailed and was penniless and jobless until she
died a pauper.The parade ended at the SPU.
