A friend said Lebohang had been dating a white man for some time.  “She was always posting nice photos of her having a good time.  “She seemed happy and we don’t know what could have caused the argument we believe led to her death,” said the friend. When the SunTeam called Pecanwood Estate, staff confirmed Lebohang was found dead on the premises.  The person who picked up the phone said she couldn’t speak to the media and advised the SunTeam to visit the estate to get the full story from witnesses.   Daily Sun also contacted Hunt, who said he knew Lebohang but was not in a relationship with her.  “It’s very sad how she died and my condolences to her family,” he said.  Police spokeswoman Sergeant Kelebogile Molepo said an inquest docket was opened.  “At this time, we have no suspects and investigations are continuing.”   Daily Sun visited Lebohang’s family home in Kagiso.  Her mum said although she was willing to speak to the media, it would have to be at a later date as she was making arrangements to take her daughter’s body to undertakers.
