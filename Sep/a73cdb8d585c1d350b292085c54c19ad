ONLY weeks into the new season there are already some clear indications of how things are likely to shape up in the Absa Premiership.Cape Town City and Maritzburg United have come out of the starting blocks with a triumphant roar, both collecting maximum points from the two matches each have played.It is early days, however, and everyone knows a perfect start doesn&rsquo;t necessarily guarantee a brilliant finish in a race that usually has more twists and turns than a roller-coaster ride. But the two coastal teams can take pride in their perfect starts to a season bound to hold thrills and spills in equal measure.Defending champions Bidvest Wits have stuttered out of the blocks, however, and have been unable to chalk up a league victory in their first two matches.It&rsquo;s been a similarly shaky start for usual championship favourites Kaizer Chiefs, while Mamelodi Sundowns&rsquo; shock loss to Polokwane City has overshadowed their superb 2-0 opening victory over cross-town rivals SuperSport United.New Orlando Pirates coach Milutin &ldquo;Micho&rdquo; Sredojevic got his tenure off to an ideal start, improving on last season&rsquo;s poor league run with a win and draw. But his team&rsquo;s performance suggests there is still a lot of work ahead for Micho.&nbsp;Elsewhere, Free State Stars haven&rsquo;t wasted any time pulling the trigger on Sammy Troughton, who became the first coach to be fired this season. By many accounts, the former Mamelodi Sundowns striker was a surprise choice for the job in the first place. In his replacement Luc Eymael, Ea Lla Koto may have found the right man to guide a team stripped of top players and operating a minuscule budget.It&rsquo;s already looking gloomy for Platinum Stars, whose long-term PSL prospects look in serious doubt. The owners have already indicated their plan to sell the club, citing escalating running costs. But they wouldn&rsquo;t want to sell their status to a National First Division team, would they?&nbsp;Chippa United bounced back from the opening loss, winning their second match.&nbsp;It remains to be seen whether any of the teams are able to maintain their momentum after the international break. &ldquo;Sometimes these breaks help you, sometimes they sort of distract you. But I am hoping it&rsquo;s more on the positive side for us,&rdquo; said Chippa coach Dan Malesela.
