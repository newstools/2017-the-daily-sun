The ambulance ended up going on a false call and the members were robbed.Mulaudzi said the department can’t afford to restrict attending to patients even though there are ongoing attacks on their medics.“We can’t afford to have no-go areas and have our personnel attacked, hijacked, robbed and killed by the very same communities they have to help.”He said paramedics are committed to serving and protecting the community day and night. “We therefore call on our communities to protect us while we save the lives and property of the residents of the city,” he said.
