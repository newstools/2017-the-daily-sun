    WHEN a taxi driver and his assistant saw water coming down on the side of the road, they didn’t see any danger as the road was clear. They got a shock of their lives when their taxi got stuck in the middle of Mpangele Road in Richmond Farm on Thursday. When they got out to check, they saw a small sinkhole and water started coming out of it. The taxi started to sink into the hole as it grew bigger and deeper. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvfI41lhiPwuFVg-CEBA-Um44PmrZPcJ7MKatajuNOleHOF8KeBlc-YiGmw7uSoy-hOMkPSOp1GaFD0F60SWnlLUnzntUSYxPeeiMnKIkssqkCQhb_w_47awBVdZcFyhINVQblLpjkxwnz-gDhHCmbcpNl9SZPMcMVypGgmbdKdzPCVgGhtm0aU3DK8kPxMsd-U-6H84VtgLnwVNDwHmC_JUHOgUHhBpdJ56HVgoKTMmyVzvXftkCpIxXrBQ6xEUYryqi5ccXuVu-uygqd5M694G1JGDxM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzH0NF3xioUU7EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The two said they felt lucky to be alive. Driver Khethukuthula Nxeke (21) said he was going to fetch passengers when the accident happened. “As I drove up, my assistant and I noticed a lot of water flowing down the side of the road. It looked like there had been heavy rain,” he said. He said he continued driving as the road was clear. “The next thing the taxi couldn’t move. The front tyres got deeper into the sinkhole. We panicked and got out of the taxi. Fortunately, the tow truck came and saved the taxi,” he said.The owner of the taxi, Xolani Maphanga, said the eThekwini Municipality must compensate him. “So far I’ve noticed the damage in the front. I want the municipality to pay for my damaged taxi and the money I spent on the tow truck,” he said.Municipal spokeswoman Tozi Mthethwa said: “Our plumber arrived on site and he repaired the leaking water pipe.”But Mthethwa couldn’t say whether the municipality would compensate Xolani.
