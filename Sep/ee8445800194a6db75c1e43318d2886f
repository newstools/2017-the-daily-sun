strike. According to Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini the strike is
not about President Jacob Zuma, who has been accused of being involved in state
capture involving his friends, the Gupta family.The federation was instrumental in Zuma ascending to the
presidency in 2009. It turned against him after his Cabinet reshuffle in March
and banned him from attending or speaking at its events.A proposal for members to march to ANC headquarters at
Luthuli House, following Cosatuâ€™s call for Zuma to step down, was made in the
central executive committee but rejected.WATCH VIDEO BELOW:
