the bank to keep offering them banking services. The bank said it would shut
the accounts of 20 Gupta-affiliated companies, including the two coal mines, by
the end of September. As a result, it was unclear what would happen to the
rehabilitation funds.   “The interim order
directs the Bank of Baroda to continue to hold the trust funds of the Optimum
Mine Rehabilitation Trust and the Koornfontein Mine Rehabilitation Trust in
interest-bearing accounts in the trusts' names,” said OUTA in a statement.It added that trustees of the two mine rehabilitation trusts
have been interdicted from “directly or indirectly dealing in any way” with the
funds, a stipulation which includes removing them from South Africa. The matter of what will now happen to these funds, and to
what extent a court has jurisdiction over where they can be kept or moved, will
be heard on December 7.http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Mining/court-freezes-mine-rehab-billions-from-gupta-owned-mines-20170926
