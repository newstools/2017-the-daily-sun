THE ANC has refused to comment on a rumour that President Jacob Zuma is planning to fire deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa in a Cabinet reshuffle. It was alleged that Ramaphosa will be replaced by presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. She is set to be sworn in as an MP, filling the position left empty by Pule Mabe&rsquo;s recent resignation. This has raised eyebrows as she is relatively low on the ANC&rsquo;s national list. Speaking at the Shop Stewards&rsquo; Council in Durban on Sunday, ANC national executive member Bheki Cele added fuel to the fire when he revealed an alleged plan for Ramaphosa to be removed. ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said he has no knowledge of any such plan.&ldquo;We cannot comment on rumours. &ldquo;The president has the power to hire and fire. &ldquo;We will answer that question if and when Ramaphosa is removed,&rdquo; he said. According to constitutional law expert Pierre de Vos, the president can lawfully remove Ramaphosa or any Cabinet minister from office.Cele claimed the idea behind removing Ramaphosa was to create chaos and derail the upcoming elective conference. He could not provide more details of the plan or where he had heard about it.Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said the rumour is based on a text message that had been circulating and should not be taken seriously. The Sunday Times reported that Dlamini-Zuma was set to replace Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande.
