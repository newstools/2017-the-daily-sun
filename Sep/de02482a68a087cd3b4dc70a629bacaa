Joe Nkabinde said he saw one taxi speeding and bumping into another. “The driver lost control and the taxi hit four pillars, which led to part of the building collapsing,” he said. Metro police spokesman Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said 16 people were injured when a structure collapsed and fell on two taxis and a car. Emer-G-Med spokesman Jurgen Kotze said four people were seriously injured, with two more still trapped in the taxi yesterday afternoon. Joburg Emergency Services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said emergency workers responded to the crash and patients were then taken to various hospitals.
