RESCUERS are unlikely to find any more survivors of
Mexico’s earthquake still buried in the ruins and will stop searching for them
at the end of Thursday, the emergency services chief said.Today marks one week since the 7,1 magnitude quake struck
around lunchtime, killing 326 people, damaging 11 000 homes, and leading to an
outpouring of civilian volunteers to aid and comfort the victims.Luis Felipe Puente, coordinator of Mexico’s Civil
Protection agency, said that rescuers would continue working at four sites but
that they would hand-pick through the debris until Thursday.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstn4wUG-UsUqahEE3S6GtW3J5ftd4c2EyNlrgNOqboAiPjX11szkk4Z1v4mNf_orHGQXJTkLT9ZBVeK3gnmeaUhPHozpy4aAQVrIUP42RZqS3z-c6pdHmtFqcMcICkpQLY8QaLRm7sZFX7F9826vwGkE2WjK-Fl0in-kOYQfRvzeBRcHSsnjhgy4GYWSxfYLSdApIcvmPgz1omHNVOR14Rh-ba44UcHdmLSvLABe5rmr4XxsiRXWpT3HtYea4rAdfFqoWQTLP-84GVVOE9VyTya3aQXicYFbN2icg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzEXPDYtQV3xEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

someone alive,” Puente said, considering that specially-trained dogs have yet
to pick up the scent of survivors.Rescuers have pulled 69 people from quake-damaged
properties, of whom 37 were still in the hospital as of Monday, 11 of them in
grave condition, Puente said.Forty-three people were still missing, including 40 who
may have been trapped beneath a collapsed office building in the Roma district
of Mexico City, Puente said. One person was believed missing at each of three
other sites in the capital.The week began with signs that Mexico was resuming its
routine as the streets filled with traffic and more than 44 000 schools in six
states reopened.But in the capital city, only 103 of the more than 8 000
public and private schools went back to class.The quake, coming exactly 32 years after a 1985
earthquake killed some 10 000 people, delivered a massive psychological blow
that specialists say will take time to overcome.“The children are in crisis and don’t want to talk. Some
kids didn’t even remember their own names,” said Enriqueta Ortuno (57), a
psychotherapist who has been working with victims in the hard-hit Xochimilco
district.Much of the nation’s attention was focused on a fallen
school in Mexico City where 19 children and seven adults died. http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-quake/mexico-in-three-day-countdown-to-search-for-earthquake-survivors-idUSKCN1C10UN
