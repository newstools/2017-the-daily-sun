    HISTORY is beckoning for University of Pretoria, who look to bag a hat-trick of Varsity Football titles. Tuks will visit neighbours Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) in the fifth edition of the Varsity Football Cup final at an already sold-out TUT Stadium on Thursday (6pm). But the TUT game will not be a walk in the park, as they will be gunning for their second title. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvtanO6R3lUShoG34YL3Bq6TJHM8CnPySszLvVIgY6dd8OhA1BeUReIqXPezycOs6R3vBCsUdqfP9yfBJ1YhOO5iLt0gd7ZUowQBBEhkV1uLP11_oV0Vw6bedZDn35PeORTWu6vCScLmOY8y7RNSz2Ckp71pLKzvGYTh3G6BGkHSbb3bBNLvaBMTTWMCcB_ornqW2clBvtQWF41qLsz_eOO7vFNlmzytNmLYlRYKc5PXFzpD6wLU6Iio-HpfGxTd1kKYQ69w1DFWHJ2Axzz\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKIY0AdVZ3TZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Our goal is to lift the trophy and to end their unbeaten run. “We have never lost this cup final and won’t lose this one.” But Ndlovu, TUT’s top scorer with seven goals, has promised to score at least another two goals in the final. He said: “I always score against Tuks. We won’t surrender our unbeaten record, not to our main rivals. We will win.”
