Our goal is to lift the trophy and to end their unbeaten run. “We have never lost this cup final and won’t lose this one.” But Ndlovu, TUT’s top scorer with seven goals, has promised to score at least another two goals in the final. He said: “I always score against Tuks. We won’t surrender our unbeaten record, not to our main rivals. We will win.”
