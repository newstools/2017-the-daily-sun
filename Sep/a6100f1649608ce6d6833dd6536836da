KAIZER Chiefs are seeking their first league win of the season – and against high-riding Cape Town City, it looks like an impossible mission.Amakhosi will be at the Cape Town Stadium tonight, trying to achieve a feat no other club has been able to in the five matches City have played since the season started. Kick-off is 7.30pm. In the five matches – two league and three cup games – the Citizens have notched up a 100% five-out-of-five record under new up-and-coming coach Benni McCarthy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuTYIVRW7s99WNhRZyIQc6zLFX6pErWoum7qztuZulaQRxIXidO7e-_osZNge-cFXBo-_ust5yWL2u-ygFix0AjDb2UvznOornsA1E7_ERfgysf0fKvJsd_5c90_xtEryd7JrYZZL5Lo5Cnq6x6a0YQ2jYU8soe236BB08c_ffJdvLvwsgysIbsBkftxqeUjJ2Z6kJvkEopbhS4sThhuKdMc0rb1SMIA3pGuAZSmUHRVero1jjdFxnVNn41h71eUMNLrhQjokBTFXzTZzgFTKoZIA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIMInBq20TxZEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The mighty have fallen very hard. As if dropping points was not enough, Chiefs’ treatment room resembles a casualty ward. Seven players, including key players Ramahlwe Mphahlele, Itumeleng Khune and Tsepo Masilela, are suffering from a variety of injuries and will not be available tonight. Mphahlele returned from Bafana Bafana duty with a knee injury and the improving rightback won’t play a role for the rest of the year. Masilela underwent surgery to repair his ankle ligament after getting injured in the 2-1 loss to SuperSport United a fortnight ago. He is only expected back in action in three months’ time. City will have been salivating at the news. They’re not playing the most beautiful football but know how to pounce on clubs that have not done their homework. It was the same last season under Eric Tinkler – and McCarthy is up to the task. “When the fixture came up I said it’s I my first chance to be a manager and they want me to be the first coach fired. But once a winner always a winner, you don’t lose that and that is what I have instilled in these guys,” said McCarthy. “It is still the most difficult job, after every game my voice is gone but I love the adrenaline, players put up unbelievable fights for the team.” Still, no one should write off Amakhosi. They will have the biggest share of crowd support and embattled coach Steve Komphela knows he can’t allow McCarthy to hoodwink him, as that may result in more calls for him to step down.
