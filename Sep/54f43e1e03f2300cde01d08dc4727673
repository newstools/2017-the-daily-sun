A 19-year-old Grade 12 learner stabbed her boyfriend at John Mbhendhe High School outside Malamulele.It is alleged the 16-year-old girl stabbed the boy because he broke up with her over a cell-phone related argument.The boy told Daily Sun he was shook for being stabbed by his girlfriend."I called her last night and told her that we must end our affair, because I was preparing for my final examination." the boy said.&nbsp;When the girl heard that he was putting the relationship on ice, the girl became angry.The school security guard Ephraim Makamu said it was embarrassing for such an act to be taking place on school premises.A teacher at the school who refused to be named said, both parents decided not to press charges and settled the matter amicably.Another 19-year-old boy was stabbed to death, this after two boys were gambling within the premises of Solomon Mahlangu High School in Modimolle.Limpopo Education spokesman Dr Nalendzani Rasila said security at school is the department's responsibility, but it should also involve the parents.
