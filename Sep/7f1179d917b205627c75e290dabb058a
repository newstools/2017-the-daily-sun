Meanwhile, Limpopo cops are investigating a case of violation of graves and corpses. This comes after a woman allegedly confessed to being part of a group that had been targeting graves over the past few years to harvest bodies for sangomas. The first grave exhumed last week was that of a man who had been buried in 2007. His head had been cut off.In April, a missing toddler’s body parts were found in an ex-prisoner’s home outside Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape. That some month, the body of Hlayisani Hlungwane was found in a shallow grave in Nsaluvani village, Giyani. The corpse was missing a few body parts.
