    GOLDEN Arrows coach Clinton Larsen says this season they intend to make life difficult for their opponents - especially at their home venue at Princess Magogo Stadium, KwaMashu. Abafana Bes’thende are one of two remaining teams in the Absa Premiership who have not tasted a defeat after six league matches.Other one is Baroka FC, they are both tied on 12 points after six matches. They both have won three and drew matches but Arrows are on top of the table due to superior goal difference.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssJSckxTkHaaN_IknPXB9OUdf46Qkt_lm5i3LULHR-Q3Vh_BrmANnbECM7CR6Otq6tiqevunApuZfZhxM_u1fzIgUsjxyj4dp820vih5pGBk_lnHryMxJYJDAFUHP842tv1nuXzIfA58xvuS_iExpMEbvhCs-xOvoLESB9JteSaaJ7BKBZEjFlg2q1tjYt1CAHN6T5PJAXTLxbWOzORTfIRqfPkjziHjKP_q5OHS1x2e1gQOQOkkCInDhV45qsuG72W35iT0eeBv9GbKxM6\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJHP54XyDHcTEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

So far this season they have played two matches at home drawing 1-1 with Bloemfontein Celtic and humiliated AmaZulu by 4-1. Said Larsen:"We need to dominate our opponents at home. We want to make life uncomfortable for every team that comes to our domain. We've started scoring goals at home. We did it in our last match (against AmaZulu) and we intend to continue with it."Arrows next home match is against Chippa United on Saturday (3pm). Larsen reckons Chippa are one of the strongest teams in the league."Chippa has players that still looking to impress their new coach (Teboho Moloi). That on it own will make this very tough for us. With Moloi there, they play direct football and they cross more than they used to while they had Dan (Malesela). Before, they played position football. I still believe that on paper Chippa are one of the strongest teams in the league," added Larsen. The former Maritzburg United and Celtic mentor also said the other important thing for him is to see his team conceding less goals this season. Last campaign they let in 44 goals and sharing the worse defensive record with relegated Highlands Park.He said:"On our last two matches we managed to keep clean sheets. I would like to see more of that this season. The other good thing is that we are scoring more. If I can compare Arrows of last season and of this campaign, I would say this time around we are more consistent. We also understand each other better - especially at the back. So far we are reaping the benefits of our pre-season hard work."So far, Arrows have conceded four goals, scored 10 and Larsen said they will be looking to continue with that against Chippa.
