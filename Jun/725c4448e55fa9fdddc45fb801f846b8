Chile advanced to the FIFA Confederations Cup Russia 2017 final with a dramatic 3-0 victory over Portugal on penalties after their semi-final clash ended goalless in front of 40,855 fans at the Kazan Arena.Following an enthralling 120 minutes that saw both sides produce genuine chances and Chile hit the post and crossbar in quick succession, the match went to penalty kicks. In contrast to a semi-final that was closely fought, the spot-kicks were lopsided. Chile goalkeeper and captain Claudio Bravo saved all three of Portugal's penalties, while his team-mates Arturo Vidal, Charles Aranguiz and Alexis Sanchez all converted their spot-kicks to send Chile to the final in Saint Petersburg on Sunday, 2 July."Portugal will look back at this and think about their missed chances in the first half. Ultimately though, Chile had the cleanest chance to end this in the second half, only to hit the crossbar and post consecutively, so perhaps it&rsquo;s fair to see them go through. Questions will be asked as to why Bernardo Silva was brought off, as he was the protagonist in so many of Portugal&rsquo;s first-half attacks. In the end, Bravo has to be applauded for a phenomenal display of penalty stopping. Heartbreaking for the Portuguese, but a good performance throughout the game." "Chile played the game they needed to play to give themselves the best chance to be in the final. It was not a team that tried to outplay Portugal as such, but one that controlled the pace and looked for the right moments to strike""They were able to manage their energy and, most importantly, to shut Portugal down."Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo was the hero on the night for the Copa America champions. The Manchester City man saved Ricardo Quaresma, Joao Moutinho and Nani's penalties to see La Roja advance to a first-ever FIFA final.
