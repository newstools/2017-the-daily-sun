SHE&rsquo;S happy to leave her shack and move into her new RDP. Hlokomelo Masiu (36) from Thambo Square in Mangaung said the house was finished on Friday. It had been left unfinished by the builder for more than seven years and was being used as a sex and drug den. She used to pick up condoms in the house every morning. But she no longer has to do that. Daily Sun published her story in February last year.The Department of Human Settlements in the province contacted the People&rsquo;s Paper and promised to finish her house. Hlokomelo said: &ldquo;I am so happy Daily Sun helped me. I was freezing in the shack but I am now living in a warm house with a bathroom. &ldquo;I enjoy the bath so much and I have peace of mind. Daily Sun is a lifesaver. If it hadn&rsquo;t got involved, I&rsquo;d still be in the shack. &ldquo;My mother will be happy in her grave as it was her dream to see us living in a decent house,&rdquo; said Hlokomelo.
