FORMER Bafana Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba on Friday finally settled his legal dispute with the South African Football Association (Safa).&nbsp; Mashaba had taken the association to the CCMA in February following his dismissal in December for gross misconduct&sbquo; insubordination and violating Safa&rsquo;s communications policy.&nbsp; This was after he lashed out at Safa officials on TV following Bafana&rsquo;s 2-1 win over Senegal in the World Cup qualifier played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in November.&nbsp; The body replaced him with SuperSport United mentor, Stuart Baxter in May.&nbsp; The two parties tried to reach a settlement last month, but could not agree on Safa&rsquo;s alleged payout offer of R1.5 million.&nbsp; Mashaba had allegedly demanded at least R2 million.&nbsp; Both parties finally reached an agreement on Friday after CCMA commissioner Hlalele Molotsi advised them to return to the negotiation table to find a solution to the arbitration case.&nbsp; Although, Mashaba&rsquo;s legal representative Claudio Bollo refused to disclose the figures due to a confidentiality clause&sbquo; SunSport has learnt the settlement is believed to be close to R2,5 million.&nbsp; Said Bollo: &ldquo;Mashaba is happy with the settlement and believes it&rsquo;s a fair amount.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bollo said Mashaba was searching for a new job.&nbsp; Explained Bollo: &ldquo;He would like to continue his job elsewhere. He wants to continue making a positive contribution to South African football.&rdquo;
