HEALTH Minister Aaron Motsoaledi yesterday cleared up the confusion around reports that a Congolese woman had been turned away from a public hospital while in labour. Francine Kalala made headlines across South Africa recently when she claimed she had been forced to give birth at Park Station in Joburg after being turned away from hospitals because she is foreign. Briefing the health portfolio committee in parliament yesterday, the minister said: &ldquo;The lady was not sent away but met an exceptionally rude nurse with a poor attitude. She was not turned away because she is an asylum-seeker. She left because of a poor attitude, which is something that also happens to South Africans.&rdquo; Motsoaledi said although it was reported that Francine had been made to wait for hours before being assisted, CCTV footage showed she arrived at the hospital at 5.14am and left at 5.55am to board the Gautrain for Edenvale Hospital in Ekurhuleni. He said when the number of foreigners treated in Mzansi hospitals was taken into account, it was clearly untrue that foreigners were not helped. Motsoaledi said his department was investigating the rude behaviour of the nurse involved. He said after giving birth, Francine was sent to Charlotte Maxeke Hospital and then referred to a community clinic.
