FOR Your Glory Organisation put smiles on the faces of 300 young school girls at Rekgonne Primary School. This was in Mangaung, Bloemfontein, when sanitary towels were donated. Assistant director of the organisation, Nombulelo Phulampa said the group was started last year when Mother&rsquo;s Day was celebrated in May. Based on their experiences while growing up, residents remembered not having sanitary towels because their parents couldn&rsquo;t afford them, so they decided to help girls at school in the same situation.&ldquo;Some of our members are police officers and police clerks,&rdquo; said Phulampa. The organisation is based in Phase 7 kasi, Mangaung and members hope to give back to the community and find a purpose in living. &ldquo;My message to the children is that they must not lose hope. They should know that God loves them and there is a better future for them.&rdquo; Marilyn Lesia said: &ldquo;We are happy for our children to have this donation as they come from poor families and the towels will help.&rdquo;
