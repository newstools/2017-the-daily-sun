RUBBISH is thrown on the sides of roads while municipal workers enter their third week on strike over alleged unpaid wages. When the SunTeam visited a municipal dump in Bloemfontein, there was stinking rubbish along the road for about 500 metres leading to the closed gate. No one was allowed to enter the site. People living near the dumpsite complain about rats, flies and the overwhelming smell of nappies and dead animals.Motorist Thabisho Tladi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Rubbish is rotting along the road that I use every day to take my kids to school and to drive to work. Since last week I couldn&rsquo;t pass there as rubbish had been scattered all over. &ldquo;I have to use another road that makes my journey longer.&ldquo;The municipal workers&rsquo; strike has affected us badly. Rubbish has not been removed from our area for more than two weeks.&ldquo;People throw their rubbish outside their houses or in the street near the dump.&rdquo;In the CBD some workers were playing loud music while boozing and waving at passing motorists. Municipal spokesman Qondile Khedama said: &ldquo;The city has put measures in place while some workers are on strike. Day-to-day household collections and CBD cleaning is being done by businesses. &ldquo;We have made a plan to collect trade waste from factories. &ldquo;We have also brought in a private company to help at landfill sites where there were difficulties due to a lack of compacting. &ldquo;We started clearing and compacting landfill sites on Sunday.&rdquo;
