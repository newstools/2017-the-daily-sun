DEPUTY president Cyril Ramaphosa told MPs that he fully supports a commission of inquiry into state capture.He was facing questions in parliament yesterday. He said South Africans should not tolerate state capture in any form.He called for the establishment of a judiciary commission of inquiry, but said only President Jacob Zuma had the power to authorise it.When Ramaphosa told MPs that Zuma was consulting legal advisors on the matter, opposition members shouted that the president was consulting the Gupta family.Ramaphosa said the inquiry would provide South Africans with the truth as well as grant those implicated in state capture an opportunity to clear their names.EFF MP Hlengiwe Hlophe asked if Ramaphosa himself supported the inquiry, to which he answered: &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; He said he was eager to know the truth, just like everyone else in the country. EFF MP Ntombovuyo Mente questioned the commitment of government to fighting violence against women and children. She reminded Ramaphosa that while campaigning he was seen drinking sorghum beer, and asked if he was just as committed to fighting gender-based violence.Ramaphosa hit back, saying Mente should not reduce serious matters to umqhombothi.&ldquo;This issue is about us. &ldquo;Everyone must take some initiative,&rdquo; he said.
