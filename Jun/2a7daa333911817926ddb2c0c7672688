PULENG Tlolane says he is gatvol! He is tired of reading about himself in the media every day &ndash; chiefly that he has left Polokwane City for greener pastures, which he says is simply untrue.He says he is still committed to Rise and Shine and has not agreed to sign a contract with any other club.Talk has been spreading like wildfire since season&rsquo;s end, with Cape Town City the first to claim that they had signed the player, followed closely by Chippa United making the same pronouncement.When contacted by SunSport for clarity yesterday, Tlolane made a passionate plea for &ldquo;people to stop this nonsense about me signing with their club(s)&rdquo;. Added the soft-spoken 26-year-old striker: &ldquo;Thanks, guys, for the opportunity to clear my name regarding what has been said about me.&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sign a contract with any team, and I don&rsquo;t have an agent. I don&rsquo;t need one to represent me anywhere because I belong to Polokwane City. People just want to mess up my career and I don&rsquo;t appreciate that at all.&rdquo;A report on the Kick-Off website claimed yesterday that Chippa boss Siviwe Mpengesi was presented with fraudulent documents and thought he was signing the player on a three-year contract.SunSport has learned that Tlolane is indeed on Chippa&rsquo;s wish list but proper procedure was not followed.But Tlolane is not impressed: &ldquo;I just want all these things to stop. Like I have said, I don&rsquo;t have an agent &ndash; I don&rsquo;t need one.&rdquo;SunSport has seen a document presented to the PSL by Cape Town City boss John Comitis in regard to the same player late last month, stating the intent to sign him.Tlolane confirmed his contract with Rise and Shine expires on 30 June 2019, with a two-year option to renew.Someone is apparently pretending to be Tlolane&rsquo;s agent, going around presenting bogus documents to unsuspecting clubs and milking them dry without the player&rsquo;s knowledge.
