KOOS Mthimunye is a broken man since his sister disappeared earlier this month. The 55-year-old man from Mabopane, north of Pretoria needs SunReaders&rsquo; help to find her.He said before she disappeared she had complained of painful, swollen feet. No medication could help her.He fetched Elizabeth Mthimunye (70) from her home in Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga on 3 June and took her to a church in Mabopane for prayers.&ldquo;I had found a church where they said they could help heal her,&rdquo; he said.After pastors prayed for her, the brother and sister went to a shopping complex in the area.Koos said he was standing in a queue to pay while Elizabeth was sitting on a bench.But when he returned, she was gone!He walked around the complex, asking people if they had seen her &ndash; but had no luck.What worries Koos is that this was Elizabeth&rsquo;s first visit ever to Mabopane.&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know the area and I think she might be scared to ask strangers for help.&ldquo;I need to find her, whether she is dead or alive.&rdquo;He said since Elizabeth went missing he lies awake at night, hoping she would come knocking on his door.&ldquo;I feel so empty, not knowing if she is safe or not. She has not returned to her own home. I will never be at peace until she is found,&rdquo; he said.Koos reported her missing at the Rietgat Police Station but said he was not given a case number.Police spokesman Captain Stephen Maluleka said Koos should go back to the police station.&ldquo;He will be given a case number. &ldquo;That will help him to follow up on the progress cops make in their search for his missing sister,&rdquo; Maluleka said.
