MORE THAN 20 years on, and the South African music industry is growing by leaps and bounds.&nbsp; But young people and many interested parties suffer from a lack of information about the international digital music world. This leaves them playing catch-up.&nbsp; The legendary DJs Unite (DJs Vinny, Christos, Oskido, Fresh &amp; Greg &ldquo;The Maestro&rdquo; Maloka) have been working to change this state of affairs in ways that have shown amazing results in the last decade. They did it through the internationally-respected Southern Africa Music Conference (SAMC).&nbsp; The 13th edition (SAMC 2017) of the conference is back this year in the last week of June, to continue its mission to nurture and grow the industry through shared relevant information.&nbsp; Oskido said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited and are looking forward to the conference.&nbsp; &ldquo;The music game is changing and we need to up our game.&nbsp; &ldquo;Social media and digital platforms have taken over &ndash; and we need to be on par.&rdquo;&nbsp; Supported by the City of Durban and Metro FM, this year&rsquo;s four-day conference will take place in Durban&rsquo;s previously disadvantaged areas, from 29 June to 2 July.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s activities kick off at Chesterville (Mashamplanes Lounge), then Friday it will be at at Ensimbini (Insimbini Lifestyle).&nbsp; Sunday&rsquo;s demo session will be at Hammersdale (Magaba Lounge).&nbsp; All sessions kick off at 9am and last until 4pm.&nbsp; Speakers at this year&rsquo;s event include these big names: DJU DJs Shimza, Ganyani and Maphorisa, Creative Arts College KZN, Mabala Noise management and representatives from Metro FM. And not forgetting hip hop names such as Nasty C and OKMalumKoolkat!&nbsp; Workshops will include important topics like production and digital age distribution via platforms such as MTN+ and iTunes.&nbsp; Sessions will be devoted to artists development, and other music outlets like movies, advertisement and video games.&nbsp; Topics include media and entertainment, festivals and live events and extending one&rsquo;s music to international platforms.&nbsp; Southern African Music Rights Organisation will tackle music rights and publishing issues.&nbsp; Metro FM staffers will talk about media and entertainment issues &ndash; from getting playlisted to creating music worth listening to.&nbsp; All musicians who attend the event will get a chance to have their music heard and commented on by industry experts at the demo session on the last day of the event.&nbsp; This particular demo session is set for 2 July at Hammersdale&rsquo;s Magaba Lounge from 2pm.&nbsp; At this venue, music makers, singers and producers are invited to come and perform.&nbsp; Their creations will be critiqued by professionals who are currently active in the industry.&nbsp; Of course, one of the SAMC highlights is the huge Mother of all Parties &ndash; the official SAMC after-party, on 1 July, at Kings Park Stadium.&nbsp; Ticket prices for this much-talked-about music event range from R150 (general) and R450 for VIP.
