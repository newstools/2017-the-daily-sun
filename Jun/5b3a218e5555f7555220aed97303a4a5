PASTOR Rueben Manatsinya of Mabopane, Tshwane believes that his prayers saved his goats from thugs. He said he prays for them every morning and again at night before he goes to sleep. He told Daily Sun he was surprised on Thursday when cops came to his house to tell him they had found two goats.&ldquo;I knew they were mine because when I went to check on them, those were gone. &ldquo;They are all protected by prayers. If people try to steal them they will eventually be brought back to me,&rdquo; he said. Meshack Matlou, SPCA spokesman, said police told him they were busy with a stop- and-search operation when they saw some men abandon their vehicle and run.When the cops searched the car they found two goats squashed into the boot.He said he was saddened by such treatment of animals.&ldquo;We are going to open a case of animal cruelty,&rdquo; he said.Matlou said the thugs could also have endangered the health of the people who would have eaten the goat meat.&ldquo;We do not know what medical state the goats were in.&ldquo;They could have been on harmful treatment.&rdquo; He warned people against buying livestock from people they do not know.
