RESIDENTS have been warned to be careful of two elephants that escaped from the Kruger National Park on Saturday night. The elephants broke through the fence and were believed to be in the bush near Qaza, Magona, Maxombye and Mtiti villages in Limpopo. Kruger spokesman William Mabasa said: “We appeal to the public to be on the lookout for the elephants. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssz_U5W9q-h6nf9soM-gtKpRqvfnj2YTdt1Wneuiw07bp2WLN7yjjY1WXSyDICweNbguN-tGbvt2RkBZWCc946XDuL187hVap1O17HoPcP3eHO0D6E2hJ9sphs9iEGFegUgokv8NQ8YWPxF2SxHCttI2bQ6QRbCsnYI7AJHkySnKmlGFlKsUL8DJ194j3aTWc4y3x1eULqaBxIinKcCW6v5mAq3-Z3K_YdncWVbHScysyRikb1ipf19iW1kcfLt8xXQoU969u9NTGvl98gLmEWwj3oFLXw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzAEJ0lQYrH4PEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Thomas Chauke from SA Wildlife and Trade Regulations said: “We are hunting down the two elephants that escaped from Kruger. “We encourage people who collect firewood not to go to the bush until the elephants are captured. “Farmers must make sure not to release their livestock from their kraals too early in the morning, because the elephants could still be roaming around.”
