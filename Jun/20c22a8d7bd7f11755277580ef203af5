NATIONAL Council of Provinces member Thandi Mpambo-Sibhukwana called on residents of Philippi, near Cape Town to break the silence against women abuse. Sibhukwana encouraged residents to talk about violence and abuse and report it to the police.On Saturday, she told residents gathered at Bongolethu Primary School they need to work together to end violence against woman and children.&ldquo;There is no humanity anymore. We would not be raped and killed like this if there was. &ldquo;A real man would not do what these people are doing.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s teach young women how to do things as we did in the past. The way they sit and talk proves they are too westernised,&rdquo; said Sibhukwana.She said rapists are people who have nothing to do other than terrorise women and children.Social worker Fezeka Njovane, who is also a secretary at Isibane NGO, said more police visibility is needed.&ldquo;People will not continue to break the law if the police are around.&rdquo; She said the social development department must create programmes for township residents to discuss the problems in their communities.Mandlenkosi Zikhali (47) said men who rape and murder women and children are cowards who are controlled by evil spirits and drugs.&ldquo;They deserve to be locked up for good. We don&rsquo;t want them to return to the community. &ldquo;The problem is that they are arrested and spend two days in jail before coming back.&rdquo;
