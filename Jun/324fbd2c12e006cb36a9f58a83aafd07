BENNI McCarthy has been appointed as the new head coach of Cape Town City FC.He is expected to be unveiled by the club in the next 48 hours.Sport24 understands that McCarthy flew to Cape Town on Friday to meet with City owner, John Comitis, and held discussions on how to take the club forward after the sudden resignation of Eric Tinkler, who took over the reins at SuperSport United.The 39-year old - who is South Africa's most decorated player - will be given his first role as head coach after completing his UEFA A coaching licence and will become one of the PSL's most high-profile coaches.McCarthy plied his trade in Europe as a player under the guidance of world class coaches - such as Jose Mourinho - when becoming the only South African to date to win a Champions League medal.Comitis previously said that he had been working around the clock to find a suitable replacement for Tinkler and believes that he has found someone who can continue the job Tinkler left unfinished."The new coach will be of the same mind (as Tinkler) in terms of the type of players we have purchased and the way Cape Town City wants to play."The coach we select will pick up the momentum we have created. With the homework I have done&sbquo; I believe I have possibly found a gem."http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/benni-mccarthy-to-be-unveiled-as-new-ct-city-coach-20170612
