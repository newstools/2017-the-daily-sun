NELSON Bay pastors were honoured on Saturday. West Coast Bible College and Seminary Africa president Dr Fanie Mqira presented them with diplomas. The preachers were over the moon after the event at Babs Madlakane Hall in Uitenhage. They had completed a three-day course. Mqira, who lives in Gauteng, urged the pastors not to go around blessing themselves. &ldquo;Never say you&rsquo;re running a big shop when you aren&rsquo;t. The demons of big shops will visit you to test you and if you are a lightweight, you&rsquo;re going to have problems.&rdquo; The man who has been a pastor for 31 years said his path was difficult for 24 years but then God remembered him. He spoke of David, who beat Philistine hero Goliath. &ldquo;He was a small boy who said an uncircumcised man can never destroy God&rsquo;s power. Never allow people to undermine you or put clothes on you that don&rsquo;t fit.&rdquo; Mqira said the law requires pastors to be accredited and follow set standards. &ldquo;Bishops and pastors need to register their churches to congregate, follow Sars rules to receive tax exemption, file returns and have good reports from registered organisations.&rdquo;
