THE Western Cape ANC&rsquo;s provincial executive committee has resolved to disband the party&rsquo;s Cape Town metro leadership. The African National Congress in the province held a policy discussion sitting for most of Saturday before it was disrupted by branch members from the Cape Town metro, provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs told the media earlier today. The meeting was being held ahead of the ANC national policy conference that gets under way on Friday, 30 June in Johannesburg. Acting chair of the meeting Maurencia Gillion and Jacobs said the sitting would reconvene to drive through the remaining agenda items. Police had to be called in to end the disruption before the sitting reconvened with 23 of 35 PEC members still present. Other leaders unhappy with the PEC&rsquo;s resolutions had left of their own accord, but the meeting &ldquo;was still quorate&rdquo;, Jacobs said. The remaining PEC members agreed by majority that the Cape Town metro leadership should be dissolved and it was a decision &ldquo;not taken lightly&rdquo;, he said. The PEC had for some time experienced resistance from the metro&rsquo;s leadership, which did not &ldquo;want to accept the authority of the PEC&rdquo;, he said. They had also experienced the worst electoral defeat in the city and their data showed that the Cape Town leadership had put in the &ldquo;least effort&rdquo; to canvass voters in the metro. The blatant attempts to divide the organisation had left the province &ldquo;no choice but to disband the Dullah Omar (Cape Town) regional executive committee&rdquo;, the PEC resolved. The leaders would remain in their positions as councillors in the municipality. A task team of 25 ANC members would be put in place to lead the party in Cape Town until a regional executive congress was held within six months.
