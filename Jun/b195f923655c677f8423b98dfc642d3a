THE Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have blamed the recession on the ANC’s inability to provide leadership, after first-quarter gross domestic product growth figures indicated that the country has entered into a technical recession. The economy contracted by 0.7% during the quarter, falling short of market expectations of a 1% expansion.EFF national spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said yesterday that South Africa’s economy has continued to deteriorate over the past few years. This paints a bleak picture for the future and quality of life for black and poor South Africans in particular, he said. The ANC leadership was only focused on “self-enrichment, lies and theft of public funds”.“It is now evident that the government has neither the ideological nor policy response to this depressing state of affairs. Instead of fostering, enhancing and harnessing economic growth, the ANC is busy developing mechanisms on how to loot people’s tax money from the fiscus,” said Ndlozi.In a statement, Ndlozi said that the report from Statistics SA shows a concerning shrink in the economy.He said South Africans should be worried as this would result in less money being available for various socioeconomic needs such as education, social grants and healthcare.“Under Zuma’s administration South Africa has been auctioned to a foreign family-led criminal syndicate which has siphoned off billions of rands from South Africa’s fiscus. Under Zuma’s administration South Africa has been relegated into sub-investment (junk) status and is now facing recession.”ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said, however, that negative growth in the private sector was to blame for the country’s technical recession.“New sectors in the private sector, the financial sector, retail and trade are negative. All those are not in the hands of government, they are in the hands of the private sector,” he said on Tuesday.Government was making considerable progress in agriculture and mining, he claimed.“Agriculture is doing well because we paid a lot of attention to it. Mining has contributed positively.”Mantashe said the ANC was putting responsibility for the country’s economic growth on the private sector and government and the private sector had to work together to get the country out of the slump.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssyiEKKKcyu7s0l_vi4bBdMXMHMKG4R3KW_WQY42oAYvoBho6gzlaccstoUqlDImIJgSze3ASHtK7Bys_QlHzTpswsx0bJQzMyJwkipwD2LztAFaabNOfe04a9F4wsuoJCYtVYh6Iud5UL-WXehX0-DMCaI_Y1JTvyWGW8RQHMC-tWUtvjbvnlt6Yoa9jea5MlmB-gERdrcaRTm0aKTcEHD6a7MWa5wRGamrOLiwy7xNQXWh9MbrC_zDfWY1c8Oyk46jcJfXYRbWPUIbFPmlsV1CE5uyNg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBVsaAEvmt_FEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")
