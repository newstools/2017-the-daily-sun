WHEN Twana Ndlovu (25) received the ancestral calling she went to thwasa at Gobela Khazamula Mathebula&rsquo;s (70) house. But when the madala allegedly proposed they sleep together and Twana refused, her powerful dreams changed to ones of having sex with the old man!The dreams only kept getting more intense until she claimed she finally poked the old man, hoping to find relief.But instead she now believes the gobela only tricked her to get her powers! Twana, from Dube, Soweto, told the People&rsquo;s Paper that in the dreams she saw herself poking the madala between white sheets.She told Daily Sun her life was perfect until she slept with the gobela in September last year. &ldquo;I confronted him about it and he said it took three years for the initiation to be complete. &ldquo;He told me the dreams show that I&rsquo;m going to prosper in life.&rdquo;&ldquo;But no one comes to visit me as a healer who is supposed to help other people.&rdquo; Twana said things don&rsquo;t add up. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t even provide for herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have powers anymore. &ldquo;Before I slept with him I was able to see things,&rsquo; she said. The SunTeam spoke to Gobela Mathebula, who denied sleeping with Twana and accused her of spreading rumours about him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve initiated more than 100 people and she is the first to do this.&rdquo; He claimed he tried to help Twana because he knew her parents. &ldquo;She never paid a cent and this is her thanks.&rdquo; He accused Twana of sending him suggestive messages. &ldquo;One message read that if I couldn&rsquo;t do things for myself she would make me warm,&rdquo; he said. He added that he didn&rsquo;t block Twana&rsquo;s blessings. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t finished her initiation. What she&rsquo;s doing will only affect her,&rdquo; he said.
