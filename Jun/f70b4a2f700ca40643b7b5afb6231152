EMILY suspects someone is raping her goat.Emily Mefo (45) from Winterveld near Mabopane, north of Tshwane, bought two goats on her birthday last May.&ldquo;It was the happiest moment of my life and I saw a good future ahead for me and my goats,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I got a male and a female so they could make babies and multiply every year,&rdquo; Emily said.She said she never thought the animals would become targets of sex pests.Emily said the male goat was killed in July by unknown people.She then named the remaining goat Tshidi, which means condolences.Things started to change when she realised that something was wrong with Tshidi in October.She said she saw the goat was bleeding from the back. She then asked one of her neighbours to lock it in their kraal at night and she would check it every morning.But that did not help because the problem continued.&ldquo;Tshidi has been violated multiple times and the attacks are continuing even now.&rdquo; Last month, she said, she was called by a passerby to rescue the goat as it was tied up a few houses away from hers.&ldquo;Its private parts were bleeding and it couldn&rsquo;t move. It was just lying there,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will happen when it gives birth. &ldquo;Will it be a kid or a human being? &ldquo;I want the evil person doing this to be locked up,&rdquo; she said. SPCA&rsquo;s inspector Meshack Matlou said they took the goat so it could be examined.
