HOT-OFF-THE-PRESS Metro FM recruit Msizi Shembe has already started making a mark on Jozi&rsquo;s social scene.&nbsp;This as the DJ&rsquo;s set to perform at the De Grandiose Caf&eacute; in Wynberg, Jozi, today &ndash; barely a month since taking over the radio station&rsquo;s Sunday Soul Therapy show, airing from noon to 3pm on the Lord&rsquo;s day.&nbsp;He will play alongside DJs Wally, Thulani, Pholosho and Elpringo.&nbsp;&ldquo;People must come in numbers. I&rsquo;m so excited because I&rsquo;ve prepared something special for them,&rdquo; Msizi said.&nbsp;&ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;ve made it a point to playlist the best music &ndash; think old-school R&amp;B, current R&amp;B and a bit of Afro-pop.&rdquo;&nbsp;He said this would be the best time for him to interact with his supporters outside the studio.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in calling my supporters fans because you end up undermining the people who give you their time,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, as far as my audience is concerned, I really respect them. I view them as the people who make my show possible.&nbsp;&ldquo;They are the ones who tune in and, through the show, we exchange views and ideas,&rdquo; Msizi said.&nbsp;&ldquo;I strongly believe that networking is key. You have to meet and talk to people in order to advance your knowledge of life.&rdquo;&nbsp;De Grandiose Caf&eacute; is where the who&rsquo;s who go for soothing music on Sundays.&nbsp;
