THEY say once bitten, twice shy!However, that seems not to be the case for a Tshwane man (28) whose car was stolen at the weekend. According to police, the man lost his car after indulging two magoshas over drinks. The next thing, he passed out and woke up somewhere else. The car and all his belongings were gone and so were the two women! Apparently, it is not the first time the man has fallen victim to a similar trap.Sunnyside police spokesman Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the man stopped to pick up the two women at the corner of Hamilton and Stanza Bopape streets in Sunnyside, Tshwane in the early hours of Friday morning. The car, a Toyota Yaris worth about R180 000, is said to belong to his girlfriend. She got it from her father as a gift. In 2015, the man allegedly lost his VW Polo Vivo in similar circumstances after he picked up two unknown women in Pretoria Central.&ldquo;They allegedly drove away in his car after he felt dizzy and stopped on the side of the road to get out,&rdquo; said Mavimbela. The man believes his drink was spiked on both occasions.&ldquo;Police are investigating cases of theft of motor vehicles,&rdquo; he said.
