THE late Yizo Yizo actor Christopher &ldquo;Gunman&rdquo; Kubheka&rsquo;s funeral was marred by controversy.&nbsp; His aunt Phindile Xaba said she gave his female friend Refiloe Lekalake from Soshanguve a hot klap after the burial on Sunday.&nbsp; Witnesses say the incident happened at Gunman&rsquo;s home in Zola, Soweto.&nbsp; The incident is said to have been influenced by the speech Refiloe delivered during his memorial service that was held at the Jabulani Soweto Theatre.&nbsp; Accor-ding to the unapologetic aunt Phindile Xaba, she gave Refiloe a hot klap because she spoke badly of Gunman at the service.&nbsp; &ldquo;In our culture, when the dead person is no more, we don&rsquo;t speak badly about them. She was very rude toward Jabu (Gunman).&nbsp; &ldquo;We know he drank alcohol, but he wasn&rsquo;t a drunkard. Another issue is she claimed to have found Gunman with a beer bottle, that disgusted me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He loved his kids and the family. Gunman&rsquo;s mum died when he was young.&nbsp; &ldquo;He grew up in my arms. I&rsquo;ll never allow someone to talk ill of him,&rdquo; she told the People&rsquo;s Paper.&nbsp; She further said: &ldquo;That small hot klap she got from me was light. I wanted to moer her until the police came to the scene.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted to teach her a lesson she wasn&rsquo;t going to forget. I was angry and people should understand Gunman was like my biological son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Refiloe denied being moered by Phindile.&nbsp; She told the SunTeam: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rubbish. I don&rsquo;t go around fighting old people. I&rsquo;ll never (do that), it&rsquo;s not in my nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;What happened was that she confronted and told me she didn&rsquo;t want me at the funeral.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was shocked because I didn&rsquo;t know what I had done wrong. The klap incident never happened,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; After the funeral, Refiloe was refused entry to the gathering.
