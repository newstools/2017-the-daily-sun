THE man accused of murdering Eskom employee Thembisile Yende has been denied bail in the Springs Magistrate's Court. David Ngwenya appeared in court briefly. He is charged with premeditated murder. Ngwenya, 43, was arrested in Carletonville last week Thursday, June 15. The 29-year-old's body was found in her office after Eskom workers noticed a bad smell. She was reported missing on May 17. Yende had worked for Eskom since December 2015. A post mortem has shown that Yende had sustained head injuries and had bruises on her neck before she died. When she arrived at work that morning, the closed circuit camera picked her up, but a few moments later the system didn't pick up any movement. National Prosecution Authority spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said the matter was postponed to Friday.
