A MAN who was arrested alongside anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol was tortured until he passed out. Veteran human rights lawyer George Bizos yesterday told an inquest into the 1971 death of Timol that Salim Essop was nearly beaten to death by the apartheid security police during interrogation. &ldquo;The young man was in a coma for three or four days after the death of Timol. When I asked him about it, he said he didn&rsquo;t know anything,&rdquo; Bizos told the inquest held in the high court in Joburg. He said Essop didn&rsquo;t even know a doctor had come to examine him. Bizos said Essop was taken to a hospital in Pretoria where nobody was allowed to see him. &ldquo;We brought an application before three judges for the right of a parent to see their child in prison. The relief we were seeking was for the father and the family to be told where their son was.&rdquo;He said apartheid cops had powers to isolate prisoners and not allow anybody to see them. Bizos said the death of 70 people in custody showed the police were a law unto themselves. Essop was arrested together with Timol on suspicion that they were carrying correspondence abroad to the Communist Party and were in possession of political pamphlets. Timol died in custody and his death was ruled a suicide in 1972. However, a private investigation launched by Timol&rsquo;s family uncovered new evidence and the National Prosecuting Authority re-opened the inquest.
