WITH most teams left with two games in the pool stages of the SuperSport Rugby Challenge, a couple of Super Rugby franchises find themselves having to dig deep to make the competition&rsquo;s quarterfinals.To make the last eight teams need to make the top two in the three pools &ndash; Central, North and South &ndash; or be one of the two teams with the next most points. As things stand, four teams, Western Province, the Blue Bulls, the Golden Lions and the Sharks XV look likeliest to make the cut.But the Free State XV and the Eastern Province Kings have an uncomfortable next two rounds coming up.&nbsp;While second in the Central Pool on 20 points, two behind the Griquas, the Free State XV not only find themselves playing Peter Engledow&rsquo;s impressive table-toppers on Friday, but they will have played seven of eight pool games.Robbi Kempson&rsquo;s Kings find themselves in the South Pool&rsquo;s desperate fight to finish second between them, the Border Bulldogs and the Boland Cavaliers, and even the winless SWD Eagles have a chance if they win all three of their remaining games. And being on a bye this weekend will deepen the sense of urgency, even though they currently lie in third.Which begs the question, is it possibly time to cheat a little by bringing on the heavy artillery in the form of the Super Rugby reinforcements, now that they are on a break for the Springboks&rsquo; June internationals against France?Believe it or not, none of the coaches are necessarily keen on the idea, even though the Blue Bulls, who lead the North Pool, have loaded their team with Super Rugby players Duncan Matthews, Rabs Maxwane, Dries Swanepoel, Franco Naude and Handre Pollard.But when the Sharks XV name the on-fire Sbu Nkosi on the wing and the recently suspended Andre Esterhuizen in their team for the weekend, maybe not everyone thinks so.But Free State coach MJ Smith, who named six players who have played Super Rugby in his team to paly against Griquas on Friday evening, gave compelling reasons not to go the Super Rugby reinforcement route.&ldquo;Of the [Super Rugby] guys we&rsquo;ve chosen only two, Jacques du Toit and Danie Mienie, haven&rsquo;t played for us,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The rest have all played for us and if we do pick Super Rugby guys, we&rsquo;re just picking fringe players.&ldquo;The thing is we&rsquo;re trying to maintain two separate teams, which is good for team culture. It [recruiting Super Rugby players] only makes a difference if you&rsquo;re struggling, we&rsquo;ve won our last three games on the trot.&rdquo;Kempson&rsquo;s answer to the question was the EP Kings should be so lucky: &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t get that luxury. The guys that were fortunate enough to play for us today did so because they haven&rsquo;t had enough game time.&nbsp;&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get the luxury of getting the real Super Rugby guys at all. If anything if injuries strike we&rsquo;re going to have to draft in club or academy players. The average age of our players is probably around 21, it&rsquo;s mostly youngsters and some of the Super Rugby guys who need game time.&rdquo;Predictably Western Province coach John Dobson, whose team has won all six of their games by bonus point, has no interest in roping in Super Rugby players.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about forming a core group of players who weren&rsquo;t going to play in Super Rugby to let the Super Rugby guys carry on with their own journey and build our own culture and be a tight team,&rdquo; he said.&rdquo;We could have got JD Schickerling down to come into the team.&ldquo;But these guys have put in the hard work I&rsquo;d rather reward them and build our own rugby culture. We may not have the same rugby CV or pedigrees as some of the Stormers players but you can see our guys play for each other. We&rsquo;d much rather create our own culture rather than ask the Super Rugby team for players.&rdquo;If that&rsquo;s the prevailing attitude, then the so-called smaller unions, traditionally the cannon fodder in these situations, can carry one hitting back.&nbsp; &nbsp;
