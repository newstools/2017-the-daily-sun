A 35-YEAR-OLD man has been arrested for the murder of five-year-old Minentle Lekhatha of Strand, Western Cape police said earlier today. "He was arrested on a charge of murder and is expected to make a court appearance in Strand on Thursday," said spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut. The man lives in Lwandle, a suburb of the popular seaside town. The investigation is continuing so police did not want to discuss how he was tracked, saying only that it had been a round-the-clock investigation. "The safety of children is a top priority for the Western Cape police and we will make every endeavour to ensure that offenders are brought to book to face the full consequences of their ruthless deeds," said Traut. Minentle disappeared on Saturday and her body was found under a bridge near the N2 highway on Monday. She had been raped and murdered. Earlier on Tuesday, the City of Cape Town announced the formation of a rapid response unit led by women who live in the city's rental units. They will be trained in quickly raising the alarm and helping to co-ordinate searches. It was established after an "upsurge" in missing children in Western Cape, with several being found dead.
