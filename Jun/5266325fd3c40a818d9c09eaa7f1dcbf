Eskom said a payment of R3 000 per victim was enough.“A live cable fell on Sisanda and Nelsiwe as they walked in the street and they were burnt.”But Eskom spokeswoman Stefanie Jansen van Rensburg said a conductor came loose from the joint and fell on the ground. “The conductor that fell was not live. When our manager visited the two women, she asked about the doctor’s visit and there were no major issues. She was told they spent R300 on a first visit and R100 on the follow-up. “We would like to see reports from a doctor and a specialist to substantiate the claims, especially the claim that they will not be able to have children due to the injuries sustained. “Out of goodwill, Eskom gave the women R3 000 each although we later learned that their medical bill was R400. “The conductor was fixed.”
