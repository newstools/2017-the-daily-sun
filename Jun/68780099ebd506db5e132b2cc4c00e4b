BAFANA Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter and his players head into their friendly international against Zambia at the Moruleng Stadium tonight (7pm) on top of the world.Baxter&rsquo;s Bafana achieved what no other SA side had managed since re-admittance to world football in 1992 when his team beat Nigeria in a competitive match in the Super Eagles&rsquo; backyard. The cherry on top is that this was Baxter&rsquo;s first match in charge after replacing axed Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba.He has warned his players to stay focused and not get carried away.However, Chipolopolo come into this clash on the back of a shock 1-0 World Cup loss to minnows Mozambique at home. It was the first time the Mambas had beaten Zambia away.Bafana stunned the&nbsp;Super Eagles 2-0 in their opening World Cup qualifier in Uyo on Saturday but the new national coach will not be resting on his laurels and has promised to make a number of changes.He confirmed midfielders Keagan Dolly and Themba Zwane, and defender Eric &ldquo;Tower&rdquo; Mathoho were out, while skipper Thulani &ldquo;Tyson&rdquo; Hlatshwayo will be on the bench.Said Baxter: &ldquo;We will have a new young centre-back pairing in Rivaldo Coetzee and Lorenzo Gordinho. I want to see how they cope with a strong Zambian attack.&rdquo;He said he wanted to give players who did not play against Nigeria game-time against Zambia: &ldquo;Friendly internationals are important to help develop the squad.&rdquo;But Baxter wants to maintain his winning start and promised he would not be taking Chipolopolo lightly. He will field a side he believes capable of beating Zambia.Keepers Darren Keet and Ronwen Williams could both get half a game each as Itumeleng Khune is rested.Baxter said he could also bring in defenders Abbubaker Mobara at right-back and Sifiso Hlanti at left-back.Andile Jali, Lebohang Phiri and the exciting Aubrey Ngoma missed the action in Nigeria, as did striker Thamsanqa Gabuza, and they could get a start against Chipolopolo.Others who come into the reckoning are second half subs Percy Tau, who scored the second goal with his first touch of the ball, Lebo Manyama, Tiyani Mabunda and striker Kermit Erasmus, if he passes a fitness test.Zambia head coach Wedson Nyirenda, who has brought a locally based squad for this clash, said: &ldquo;South Africa remain one of Africa&rsquo;s formidable footballing sides. My hope is that the game carries all the ingredients of a great Southern African derby.&rdquo;
