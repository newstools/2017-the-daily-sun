WESTERN Cape Premier Helen Zille has been suspended from Democratic Alliance activities for tweets she posted in March about colonialism, the party's Federal Executive said on Wednesday. The DA's highest decision-making body decided by "an overwhelming majority" to officially suspend Zille until her disciplinary hearing is concluded, DA federal chairperson James Selfe said in a statement. "The Federal Executive agreed that Ms Zille&rsquo;s social media commentary and public utterances in connection with colonialism breaks down public trust, stunts South Africa&rsquo;s reconciliation imperative, and undermines our political project," Selfe said. Zille will remain in her position as provincial premier. Only the Western Cape legislature can remove her. Zille had been given 72 hours to submit reasons why she shouldn't be suspended, which she filed on Tuesday. She is facing charges of bringing the party into disrepute following tweets she posted on March 16 that were interpreted as a defense of colonialism. Zille said party leader Mmusi Maimane and the DA's Federal Executive had pre-judged her when arriving at their decision to suspend her from party duties."It is clear, however, that he has pre-judged and taken a decision to suspend me."She said a Sunday Times article on June 4 indicated the Federal Executive had already voted and made a decision on her suspension, before her reasons could be submitted on June 6."This initial material failure to comply with due process has serious implications. The leader has, in a public statement, made it clear that he wants me suspended and has already decided to suspend me."This put the Fedex in an "impossible position" to make an objective determination, whatever the merits of her arguments against suspension."In any event, Fedex has equally compromised itself on this decision," Zille said."While I have been profoundly hurt by the way this matter has been handled by Fedex and the unfounded accusations levelled against me by the leadership, which I can only style as a vindictive and personal campaign against me, I have no intention of participating in a DA Fedex or Federal Council under current circumstances.&ldquo;As the Leader knows, I have asked him, before every Fedex since this issue arose, whether he would prefer me to absent myself. When he answered in the affirmative, I stayed away in order to make matters easier for him.&rdquo;"I would be grateful if Fedex and the leadership portray this decision as being what it is: an honest attempt by me, and at my initiative, to save the party any further reputational damage, cost or time wastage."She said she hoped an unbiased FedEx re-applied its mind to the situation based on her reasons, to come to a different conclusion.She was also critical that the FedEx had been convened so soon after she submitted her reasons at 17:00 on Tuesday, questioning the time it could have had to consider her response.&nbsp;
