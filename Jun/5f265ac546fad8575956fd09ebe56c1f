RENEILWE &ldquo;Yeye&rdquo; Letsholonyane says it is a special feeling to have won the Nedbank Cup with two different teams. The veteran midfielder was on the winning side with SuperSport United on Saturday when they beat Orlando Pirates 4-1 to retain the Ke Yona trophy at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Letsholonyane first won this tournament in 2013 with Kaizer Chiefs. He had a stellar game against Pirates on Saturday and looked like he was enjoying himself in the middle of the park. Said Letsholonyane: &ldquo;I feel honoured to have won this cup for the second time in my career. It means a lot to me as a player to get this opportunity. I&rsquo;m really happy and grateful.&rdquo;Letsholonyane is not the only player who has won this cup twice. He is joined by United&rsquo;s Kingston Nkhatha, Mandla Masango, Morgan Gould, Reyaad Pieterse and Keegan Richie &ndash; who were his teammates at Amakhosi in 2013. Coach Stuart Baxter was also on the bench for Amakhosi back then and on Saturday he was in the dugout as SuperSport United head coach for the last time. Baxter will now take over his Bafana Bafana duties full-time. Letsholonyane also said all they wanted to do on the day was to win the Nedbank Cup for themselves and for Baxter. Said Yeye: &ldquo;It is always a great feeling to win such tournament. For us the important thing that we wanted to do was to win the match to retain the cup. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy we were able to do that.&rdquo;The 35-year-old added that he hadn&rsquo;t given up on a return to the national team now that Baxter was at the helm. &ldquo;I still feel good and still have the legs for Bafana,&rdquo; said Letsholonyane
