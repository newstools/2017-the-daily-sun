POLICE say nine people have been arrested in Benoni after a violent Monday morning protest. Captain Nomsa Sekele said two people have been arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property, two for public violence, and five others for allegedly being in the possession of stolen goods. Sekele could not confirm how many were arrested in Actonville, about 12km south west of Benoni. Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Wilfred Kgasago said protesters barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks at around 05:00 on Monday. Kgasago said the most affected road was Snake Road in Benoni. "They were stoning cars and later split into two groups: Some of them were looting the shops," he said. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. He said after being addressed by the chief of police, the protesters then marched to the Benoni police station to demand the release of those arrested. "The main group went to the police station while the other group continued to loot... and they also damaged the Benoni fire station." Emergency Management Services spokesperson William Ntladi said they did not calculate the damages to the fire station as yet. "The fire station will be closed for the day. We are closely monitoring the situation with police and metro police," Ntladi said.
