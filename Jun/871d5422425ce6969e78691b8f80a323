A GROUP of alleged armed robbers ran out of luck yesterday when they tried to hit a cellphone store at Riverside Mall, just a few hundred metres from the Rondebosch police station in Cape Town. Officers reacted to a panic alarm which was activated by a staff member and rapidly approached the scene off Main Road with caution, said Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut. The group shot at the police but they were quickly outnumbered. Four male suspects aged in their 30s were arrested. Detectives are in hot pursuit of two other suspects who managed to flee the scene in a VW Polo. "Fortunately no-one was injured during the wild shootout by the suspects," Traut said. The four will appear in Wynberg Magistrate's Court once they had been charged.
