JABU NDALA feels he&rsquo;s being haunted by his daughter, Zinhle. He said every time he goes to sleep, he sees her in his dreams, wandering around as if she&rsquo;s lost. The 49-year-old from SNS in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, said he believed he was having the dreams because the mystery of Zinhle&rsquo;s death was never solved by the police. The nine-year-old went missing last January and her body was found wrapped in a plastic bag in a drain the following month. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a year now since her death and my life has been on hold ever since. I can&rsquo;t work or do anything. She is the only thing on my mind.&rdquo; Jabu said when Zinhle appeared in his dreams, the pain became too much to bear. He said he felt as if he had failed to save her. The devastated father said he had gone to the Methodist Church so members could pray for him to find closure. He believed the church could help him find the strength to move past his grief. &ldquo;I need to find peace so I can move on with my life and focus on my family.&rdquo; Bishop Kenneth Ngetu of the Methodist Church said there wasn&rsquo;t much they could do for the Ndala family other than pray. He said he hoped the church&rsquo;s prayers would force the little girl&rsquo;s killers to be overwhelmed by guilt and to hand themselves over to the police. &ldquo;We believe it will also help the police catch the criminals who did this and help the family find peace.&rdquo; Mamelodi police spokesman Captain Mike Mbewe said they would not rest until the criminals were arrested.
