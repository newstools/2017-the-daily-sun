THE EFF says it has received reliable information that while Malusi Gigaba was minister of home affairs he unduly granted the Gupta family South African citizenship. In a letter dated 2015-01-22, GG Hlatshwayo, on behalf of the director-general, &ldquo;correctly denied&rdquo; the Guptas South African citizenship, stating that they &ldquo;did not comply with the requirement in terms of section 5(1)(b) of the South African Act 2010&rdquo;, the EFF said on Monday. Hlatshwayo indicated that the Guptas &ldquo;did not have five years of physical residence in the Republic of South Africa&rdquo;, the EFF statement said. The application for naturalisation was therefore unsuccessful and the Guptas were advised to make another attempt on December 23, 2015 &ldquo;provided (they) do not exceed 90 days outside South Africa for every year in the five years preceding a new application and comply with requirements as prescribed in the Citizenship Act, Act 17 of 2010 as amended&rdquo;. A few months later Gigaba, in a letter dated 2015-05-30, wrote to the Guptas granting them what he termed &ldquo;early naturalisation&rdquo;. Gigaba said that &ldquo;after careful consideration of the matter, I have decided by the powers vested in me under section 5(9)(a) of the South African Citizenship Amendment Act, 2010 (Act no 17 of 2010), to wave the residential requirements in regards to your application for naturalisation and grant you early naturalisation&rdquo;. The EFF said it was taking the matter to court.
