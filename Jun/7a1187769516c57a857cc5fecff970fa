LOOKING at Amos Makhubela&rsquo;s face today, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe him if he told you that he never used to drink alcohol.In fact, he would only touch booze during traditional ceremonies.But for the past 10 years Amos (46) has been getting drunk every day, starting in the morning and drinking, until late at night. The dad of four from Kasibhejane near Komatipoort, Mpumalanga, claims a voice keeps waking him up in the early hours of the morning, telling him to go and booze.&ldquo;I believe a tokoloshe has been sent to ruin my life. I used to drink to please my ancestors during ceremonies, but witches used alcohol to punish me.&rdquo;Amos said he started hearing the sweet voice of a tokoloshe 10 years ago.He said he was tired of the tokoloshe and would do anything to get rid of it. His wife Maria Makhubela (45) said she didn&rsquo;t think her husband was an alcoholic as he was never a regular drinker. She believes he needs a sangoma.Local sangoma Tavasane Ndlovu (56) said Amos needs cleansing. &ldquo;He is being haunted for not listening to his ancestors. He needs to connect again and be cleansed, and that would set him free.&rdquo;
