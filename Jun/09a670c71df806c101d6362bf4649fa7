MINING union Amcu has kept its promise to the family of killed Marikana strike leader, Mgcineni &ldquo;Mambush&rdquo; Noki. On Saturday, union leader Joseph Mathunjwa formally handed over a three-bedroom house to Noki&rsquo;s family in Twalikulu Village, near Mthatha in the Eastern Cape. The house is the first of 34 to be built for each miner killed in the massacre. Noki, who became known as the man in the green blanket, was a rock drill operator at Lonmin platinum mine in the North West. Noki&rsquo;s wife, Mathapelo Lekotje said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that the house was built at the expense of my husband. &ldquo;But we are grateful to the union for seeing that the house was built for us. &ldquo;I was angry at first, but now I&rsquo;m proud of my husband. It shows that he died a hero.&rdquo; Chief Dalisizwe Dudumayo said Noki was a man who still had a lot to offer at the time of his death. He said the mining company still owed the family a lot. Mathunjwa said the union built the first house for Noki&rsquo;s family as he had led the strike.&ldquo;Mambush will always be remembered for the role he played during the strike. &ldquo;He fought against the peanuts that mineworkers earned. He fought for the dignity of the miner and now this house will restore his dignity.&rdquo;Mathunjwa said the union would continue to fight for the rights of workers. &ldquo;We will also help the families of the 34 victims wherever we can.&rdquo;Lonmin is paying for the education of Noki&rsquo;s five kids.
