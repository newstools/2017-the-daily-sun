FURIOUS protesters brought Motherwell to a standstill yesterday. They barricaded roads leading into the Nelson Mandela Bay township with burning tyres and rocks, demanding houses. The chaos erupted after the court sheriff served the Wells Estate residents with a 24-hour eviction letter. When other people who were busy erecting shacks in neighbouring Kamvelihle heard what had happened, they joined in. Soon, a crowd of residents holding spades, picks and axes had formed, shouting that they were going nowhere. The protest leader said: &ldquo;I was busy erecting my shack when I heard our shacks were about to be demolished. &ldquo;We have been registering to get houses since 2000, but we see people from other areas getting RDPs in our kasi.&rdquo; MMC for human settlements Nqaba Bhanga said the municipality understood the plight of residents. &ldquo;But our position is very clear. We&rsquo;re going to evict people who are occupying land illegally because we&rsquo;ve learnt that some of them want to jump the queue. There is a housing plan in place,&rdquo; said Bhanga. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: &ldquo;Residents burned tyres on Addo Road, stoned an ambulance, and threw a flammable object on it. Two buses were also stoned.&ldquo;Cops are busy directing vehicles at the scene. A case of public violence will be opened. No one was arrested or injured.&rdquo;
