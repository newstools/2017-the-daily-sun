BIDVEST Wits championship winning coach Gavin Hunt has put his weight behind new Bafana Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter. Hunt, who won the Absa Premiership and MTN8 double this season, confided he had spent an hour with Baxter discussing Bafana ahead of the Scotsman naming his squad to play Nigeria in a tough 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Uyo on 10 June.Hunt also backed his club skipper Thulani &ldquo;Tyson&rdquo; Hlatshwayo to be named as the new Bafana captain.Said Hunt: &ldquo;I spoke to Stuart about a lot of things and told him it would be difficult in Nigeria. It will be horses for courses there.&rdquo; Hunt backed his tough-as-teak defender Hlatswayo as the new Bafana skipper: &ldquo;If we want a new era, a new dawn and someone to build the squad around, Tyson is the perfect player.&ldquo;He is not the sort that screams and shouts. He has plenty of endeavour. He is a true professional on and off the field.&rdquo; Hunt was yesterday named as the Premiership Coach of the Month for May while his goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs was named Player of the Month.After leading Wits to their first Premiership title, Hunt is set to break more records in what is already a star-studded coaching career.He equaled the four league titles won by Gordon Igesund and the late Ted Dumitru and is set to win many more.Said Hunt: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of personal records. But one thing for sure, (at 53) time is on my side. But who would have thought a club like Wits would win the league. It&rsquo;s a massive achievement for the players and the club.&rdquo; Hunt joined the Clever Boys in 2013 after winning three back-to-back titles with SuperSport United.Said Hunt: &ldquo;It is easier once you have won the title to try and retain it. You know when things are going wrong the second time round and you can fix problems easier. So I&rsquo;m going all out to try for a fifth title. I believe we can do it again with Wits.&rdquo;But Hunt stressed the competition would be tougher next season. He explained: &ldquo;Clubs like Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates, Cape Town City, Sundowns and SuperSport United are all going to strengthen their squads.&rdquo; Hunt said he would be looking to bring in reinforcements in the off-season: &ldquo;We need some defenders and one or two players up front.&rdquo; Hunt said he was also determined to do well in the Caf Champions League next year.Said Hunt: &ldquo;People keep saying we don&rsquo;t take Africa seriously. That&rsquo;s not true. We got a really tough draw in the Champions League this year when we drew the best side in Africa &ndash; Egypt&rsquo;s Al Ahly in the first round and we lost 1-0 over two legs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give Africa a full go. We&rsquo;re looking forward to it but it&rsquo;s not going to be easier as SA champs.&rdquo;
