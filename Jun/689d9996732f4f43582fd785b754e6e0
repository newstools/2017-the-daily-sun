RESIDENTS marched to the Gugulethu cop shop on Saturday, accusing police of failing to arrest suspects. They said they don&rsquo;t understand why the people who allegedly broke into the ward 40 councillor&rsquo;s office and poured kak all over it are still roaming the streets. Councillor Bongani Ngcombolo said cops didn&rsquo;t arrest the suspects when he reported the matter to them earlier this year. &ldquo;When these people disrupted my office they weren&rsquo;t arrested. &ldquo;When the community reacted and destroyed the shack of one of these people, the police were quick to react. They arrested them and opposed bail, which is actually what angered me and why we&rsquo;re here today.&rdquo; Ngcombolo said cops must do their work without fear or favour because their duty is to protect the community.Community leader Thanduxolo Temba said the group of people who destroyed the councillor&rsquo;s office are up to no good.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to stop development in our ward. &ldquo;They at one point tried to stop rubbish collection but we managed to stop them.&rdquo; Temba said residents fear that if police don&rsquo;t intervene by arresting these people, they&rsquo;ll stop a big housing project that&rsquo;s set to start next year.Ngcombolo told Daily Sun that if anyone has a problem with him they must write to the ANC, who employed him. &ldquo;They might as well wait for the local government elections in 2021,&rdquo; said Ngcombolo, vowing that he won&rsquo;t be discouraged by individuals.Ngcombolo said he will take the Gugulethu police to the Independent Police Investigation Directorate if they do not change their attitude.A memorandum of demands was accepted by Captain Perumar Moodley, who promised to hand it over to the station commander.One of residents&rsquo; demands is for the current CPF executive to be dissolved.
