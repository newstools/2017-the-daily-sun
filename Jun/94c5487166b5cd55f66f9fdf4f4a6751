He was worried that thugs would also use it for their evil deeds.&ldquo;So to prevent thugs from using the building, I decided to turn it into a spaza.&ldquo;I first went to the councillor to get a letter that would allow me to use the building.&ldquo;Now I sell vegetables, chips and other things. Since I started this month, residents have stopped dumping rubbish here. &ldquo;The place is clean and safe for kasi people,&rdquo; said David. Resident Nomonde Ndaba (41) said: &ldquo;David saved us from the thugs.&ldquo;The old building was also used as a smoking spot.&rdquo;Councillor Mondli Zwane confirmed that he gave David permission to use the building.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that local boys were using the building as a smoking area so to avoid further criminal activities, I let David to use it to run his shop.&rdquo;
