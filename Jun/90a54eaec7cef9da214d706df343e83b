PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma yesterday told parliament the leaked Gupta emails showed there was transparency in Mzansi. The president, who was in parliament for a question and answer session, was booed by the opposition after making the claims. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the emails come from and I don&rsquo;t know if they are authentic. What we did was to establish an inquiry and the emails are going to be looked into,&rdquo; he said. When asked about the country&rsquo;s ratings downgrade and the economic recession, Zuma said many countries had been struggling since the 2008 crash. &ldquo;We are working on a nine-point plan. We are also improving our exports,&rdquo; said the president. When asked about the controversial new Mining Charter, Zuma said it was meant to redress the imbalances of the past. Speaking about the controversial nuclear deal, he said it was a lie that agreements had already been made with Russia to build stations. When the opposition said he didn&rsquo;t care about the unemployed but only his child, he said lots of young people were in business and his son, Duduzane, was not unique.&ldquo;You are being funny to a young man who went to school and capacitated himself and is now a businessman,&rdquo; said the president.
