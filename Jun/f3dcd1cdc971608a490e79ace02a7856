&ldquo;WHERE will we run to if we are not even safe at police stations, clinics and hospitals?&rdquo; These were the words of an angry woman who lives near Lenasia South Clinic in Joburg, after an 18-year-old girl was raped in the toilets at the clinic on Wednesday afternoon. Speaking about the incident, Lieutenant Kay Makhubele said: &ldquo;She went to the toilet and was raped by an unknown man in there. The suspect then ran away.&rdquo; Makhubele could not say whether the clinic had surveillance cameras which could help identify the man. IFP Gauteng caucus leader Bonginkosi Dhlamini said he was horrified to learn of the incident, particularly at a clinic, which was supposed to be safe and secure. He said the incident proved crime levels were out of control. &ldquo;It is important for each hospital or clinic to demand a greater degree of vigilance from security companies appointed to guard them. &ldquo;They need to make sure they follow the standard procedures set out by the security industry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the past rapes have been reported but they happened after hours. Staff need to investigate this and give us all the facts. &ldquo;How could this have happened during working hours?&rdquo; The DA&rsquo;s shadow health MEC, Jack Bloom, expressed outrage over the incident. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m utterly shocked, especially because there is a huge amount of money being spent on security at the clinic,&rdquo; said Bloom. &ldquo;We need to know how a security lapse occurred at this clinic, which is guarded by a security company paid more than R6 million a year. &ldquo;The security cameras should help to identify the attacker.&rdquo;
