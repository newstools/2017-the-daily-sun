MZANSI drug use statistics paint a sad picture that seems to be getting worse every year.The main concern is the negative effects it has on the mental and physical health of abusers.This week is South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (Sanca) Drug Addiction Awareness Week, which ends on Wednesday, 28 June, As part of Youth Month, SunHealth turns the spotlight on drug abuse.Shelley Andersen, an accredited addictions counsellor at Akeso Clinic Umhlanga, said drug use is rife among the country&rsquo;s youth and was increasing. &ldquo;The average age of experimentation in South Africa is 12 years and getting younger. While the age of patients undergoing treatment in Gauteng ranges from nine to 82, the proportion of patients aged 10 to 19 years increased to 29%,&rdquo; Andersen said.Already in 2010 a study reported that 12% of all Mzansi pupils had used at least one illegal drug such as heroin, Mandrax and cocaine.Current trends among the youth are the drop in ages to 12, the resurgence of Mandrax, and also the fact that youth don&rsquo;t see the dangers of drug abuse.&ldquo;Youth issues largely prevalent include bullying, peer pressure, stress, depression, anxiety, anger, self-harming, low self-worth and suicide attempts. Many pupils say that they have been offered, sold or given illicit drugs at schools.&rdquo;Mzansi&rsquo;s drug problem, however, extends far beyond our youth, with substance abuse even affecting people in their 80s. We are in the top 10 of the world&rsquo;s narcotics and alcohol abusers &ndash; twice that of the world average.Dr David Bayever of South Africa&rsquo;s Central Drug Authority said at least 15% of South Africans have a drug problem and this number was expected to rise. Most commonly abused drugs are cannabis, alcohol and tobacco.&ldquo;Drug abuse often leads to serious physical and mental health problems,&rdquo; he said.Moreover, drug use, including smoking, cause or add to deadly problems such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, HIV/Aids, hepatitis and lung disease.&ldquo;A person on drugs is also more likely to have accidents while driving, at work, at the house or at parties. Drug use can make people angry and violent. &ldquo;Worse still, drug use make depression feel worse even suicidal. Drug overdoses also kill people and the rate of overdoses is also escalating worldwide,&rdquo; he added.
