Black Coffee and Somizi have just shown us that we&rsquo;ve all been doing this whole selfie thing totally wrong.Our very own celebs are becoming trend setters and joining the global trend of drone selfies, or simply AirSelfies.Drone selfies are videos and images taken on a drone device that attaches to your smart phone and shoots images and videos from above.A UK-based started called AirSelfie is fast becoming a game-changer in this field.The device fits in a case together with your smartphone and is controlled by a virtual joystick through an app.Our very own internationally-acclaimed DJ, Nkosinathi &lsquo;Black Coffee&rsquo; Maphumolo, first showed us how it&rsquo;s done with his drone selfie.And then Somizi Mhlongo followed suit with his very own drone selfies while on holiday in Tanzania this past week.
