Model and Entrepreneur Masego "Maps" Maponyane is a &nbsp;#StyleCrush for his tailored, structured and ultimate gentleman style.&nbsp; In my opinion, Maps is one of the most stylish tailored celebs in Mzansi.&nbsp; Maps was first recognised when he won Cosmopolitan Sexiest SA Man 2013, and with his cute nerdy glasses, charming grin and sexy abs you can't help but have to notice him.&nbsp; He has made a name for himself as Mzansi's "IT" boy and being an entrepreneur, suits have become his signature look.&nbsp; So he gets brownie points because he's tall and has a great body - two of the most important things needed to be able to rock a suit.&nbsp; But Maps always looks polished, tailored and as if suits were made for him.&nbsp; He mixes textiles, prints and colours that give him an edge, but still is also super sophisticated.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of Maps Maponyane's fabulous style: Blessed To Be Living My Best Life More And More Each Day Just By Blocking Out The Noise And Quietly Making Moves????????????? #VCPC10 #VCPoloClassic #ClicquotStyleA post shared by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on Jun 4, 2017 at 8:26am PDTL O O K O U T ??: @mrkoodgeA post shared by Maps Maponyane (@mmaponyane) on May 23, 2017 at 10:34pm PDTOne More, Just For Domenico and Stefano: Thank you @dolcegabbana and @jay_teja behind the lens??
