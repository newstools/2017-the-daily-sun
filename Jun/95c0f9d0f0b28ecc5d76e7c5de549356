EFF leader Julius Malema will meet with farm management to find out what triggered a dispute between workers and his lawyer.&nbsp; The lawyer, Tumi Mokoena, is accused of attempted murder after he allegedly shot and injured four farm workers. He has claimed he acted in self-defence. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Mokoena was granted bail of R10 000 in the Thabamoopo Magistrate&rsquo;s Court earlier today. During the bail hearing Mokoena, in an affidavit, said that during a confrontation last Thursday at Zebediela Citrus Estate, he fired shots after he overheard workers, who were armed with stones and sticks, saying they did not want him around. Malema, who arrived in court to support Mokoena, said he would meet with workers to find out what triggered the conflict. Speaking to reporters outside the court, Malema said: &ldquo;It has been an unfortunate scene, especially black brothers and sisters: We must learn the art of resolving whatever difficulties in very much a peaceful way.&rdquo; He pleaded for peace, saying people should at all times avoid confrontation because it led to unfortunate situations. &ldquo;We believe Mr Mokoena is innocent and it will be proved in court, and we have full confidence in our judiciary. We hope that the sooner they resolve this matter the better,&rdquo; said Malema. He said he would arrange a meeting with the farm&rsquo;s management to understand what triggered the dispute. Meanwhile, the Food and Allied Workers&rsquo; Union in Limpopo said it was disappointed that Mokoena had been released on bail. Fawu provincial chairperson Peter Mashishi said: &ldquo;We are so discouraged, we never thought that Mokoena will be granted bail, because workers are still in hospital while he is free.&rdquo; Mokoena is due to appear in court again on 25 August.
