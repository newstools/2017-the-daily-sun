WHEN the time came to celebrate his birthday party, socialite Jabulani &ldquo;Cashflow&rdquo; Ngcobo did not just go big, he splurged.&nbsp; And the 32-year-old forex trader &ndash; known for his penchant for the very best that life has to offer &ndash; said last week&rsquo;s affair was also to mark his recent victories.&nbsp; Said Cashflow: &ldquo;Remember, earlier this year my name was cleared from all the rumours. I won all the fraud, theft and contravention of the Banks Act cases against me.&nbsp; &ldquo;That victory meant something to me. That is why I went all out to celebrate my name being cleared, along with my decade in trading.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Cashflow&rsquo;s shindig was attended by the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of Mzansi&rsquo;s black diamonds, including ANC Youth League bigwig Reggy &ldquo;Govner&rdquo; Nkabinde, sushi king Kenny Kunene, DJ Zinhle and radio personality Lerato Kganyago, among others.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m known as a big spender. And although I won&rsquo;t disclose how much I spent, you can be sure it was quite sizable. In fact, I spent a lot so I could trend on social media.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Sunday Sun sources could not stop waxing lyrical about &ldquo;the mother of all parties&rdquo;.&nbsp; Said a source: &ldquo;This guys really means business. He may easily have spent several millions.&rdquo;&nbsp; A second mole said: &ldquo;The party was over two days at Sandton&rsquo;s Taboo nightclub and the Munro Hotel in Houghton, Jozi. The cake was a Louis Vuitton bag with dollars popping out.&rdquo;
