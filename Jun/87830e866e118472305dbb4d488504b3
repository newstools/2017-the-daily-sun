HOME Affairs was served with a notice that workers would strike over their working hours. The department&rsquo;s director general, Mkuseli Apleni, spoke to the media yesterday in Tshwane and said the strike will start on 19 June if a solution is not found before then. Workers said they&rsquo;re unhappy about working on Saturdays, but talks between management and unions failed to resolve the issue.Apleni said: &ldquo;We tried to resolve the dispute by offering workers a Wednesday off for every Saturday they work.&ldquo;They did not agree to this &ndash; they want to be paid more for working on Saturdays. We are not in a financial position to agree to overtime pay for Saturdays. &ldquo;If the strike goes ahead it will seriously interrupt the services the department provides to citizens. &ldquo;We are concerned by threats of a strike ahead of one of our busiest periods in the year &ndash; the school winter holidays. The number of clients requesting travel documents shoots up as families prepare for the long break.&rdquo; Apleni said there is no alternative for the services that Home Affairs offers.&ldquo;We need to find a speedy solution. In the meantime, officials are expected to comply with the current opening and closing hours, including providing services on Saturdays. &ldquo;We are doing everything in our power to stop the disruption of service delivery.&rdquo; Apleni denied that management has intimidated workers, as alleged by some unions.&ldquo;But we will not hesitate to impose labour rights to protect officials, whether they belong to unions or not,&rdquo; he said.
