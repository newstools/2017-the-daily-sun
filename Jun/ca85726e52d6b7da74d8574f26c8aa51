WHAT was meant to be a happily-ever-after tale of romance has allegedly turned into a nightmare for actress Palesa Madisakwane.&nbsp; This as the former Generations star allegedly lives in fear for her life after a woman, rumoured to be pregnant with her new boyfriend&rsquo;s baby, &ldquo;has lost her marbles&rdquo;.&nbsp; According to insiders, the woman, known only as Phumzile, has been stalking Palesa and threatening her for stealing the good life she had with Pretoria businessman, Nico Matlala.&nbsp; Said the first mole: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just plain old nuts. Nico had moved on to actress KB, then broken up with her, before hooking up with Palesa.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nico allegedly dated Phumzile after dumping KB and before getting together with Palesa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Phumzile has been sending her friends to stalk, harass and follow Palesa around. It&rsquo;s sad how what was meant to be a honeymoon stage of their relationship has turned into a real-life horror.&rdquo;&nbsp; When called for comment, Palesa said she would not allow anything to come between her and her happiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to entertain this negativity around Phumzile,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; A second source claimed Nico considered hiring a bodyguard in a bid to protect his woman.&nbsp; The third insider said: &ldquo;Phumzile regrets having lost a good loving man who used to do everything for her. She used to drive big cars and live large, but now that&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; The source claimed Palesa and Nico were confused by Phumzile&rsquo;s actions.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if it was Palesa who came between them and ruined their relationship. They had broken up already,&rdquo; the source claimed.&nbsp; Phumzile said she broke up with Nico when she was seven months pregnant.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t have time for Palesa,&rdquo; she said. Nico could not be reached for comment.
