Joined by their parents, kasi pupils from Sondelani, Gugulabasha, Phembisizwe and Bhekisisa schools staged a march against drugs and alcohol abuse. The pupils said substance abuse has been identified as the main culprit behind the escalating crime rate in the area.Samkelisiwe Ralani (14), a grade 9 pupil at Sondelani School, said: &ldquo;Crime affects everyone. We visited all the local hot spots. We shared information on how and where they can get professional help. &ldquo;Drug addicts snatch our bags and cellphones in the streets because they will do anything to get their next fix or bottle of booze.&rdquo;Social worker Raylene Meth from KwaMashu social development said young people should know that the department&rsquo;s doors are always open for all those who need help to stop using drugs or alcohol. &ldquo;We do the necessary assessment and find out how much help they need. &ldquo;We also send them to facilities where they will be taken care of throughout the rehabilitation process,&rdquo; said Meth.
