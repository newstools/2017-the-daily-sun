BAFANA BAFANA legend, Steven &ldquo;Schillo&rdquo; Pienaar, has not ruled out the possibility of teaming up with former teammate and new Cape Town City coach, Benni McCarthy, at Cape Town City.But Pienaar&rsquo;s next move depends on his favourite Premiership club, Orlando Pirates.The 35-year-old, whose contract with relegated English Premiership outfit Sunderland expired at the end of last season, made no secret of the fact that he wants to hang up his boots at the Soweto giants.But if Pirates don&rsquo;t grant him an offer soon, Pienaar, who has played for over a decade in Europe, will consider working with McCarthy, whom he holds in high regards.Speaking at the Steven Pienaar Games in Westbury on Youth Day, the former Everton star has also tipped his former national team mate McCarthy to be a success at City.The former Champions League winner with FC Porto in 2004 was unveiled as the new coach by City earlier this week.McCarthy has a Uefa A coaching licence and has no coaching experience, but he will be a hit, according to Pienaar.Pienaar said: &ldquo;I want to end my career in South Africa and wouldn&rsquo;t mind working with him, but my first prize is Pirates. They know I&rsquo;m available and it&rsquo;s up to them to come and get me. If Pirates don&rsquo;t sign me, I&rsquo;d love to work with Benni. I&rsquo;ll also consider offers from other teams.&rdquo;On McCarthy&rsquo;s new reign with City, Pienaar said: &ldquo;Benni has played football at the highest level and he&rsquo;s by far the most successful South African footballer who played abroad. It&rsquo;s a bold statement by John Comitis. He knows Benni as a footballer and as a professional. I believe he&rsquo;ll be a successful coach.&rdquo;Pienaar is also excited about the new Bafana coach, Stuart Baxter. &ldquo;Bafana are on the right track. Baxter is the best man for the job,&rdquo; he said.
