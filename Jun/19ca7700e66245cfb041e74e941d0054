SOUTH Africa does not deserve leaders who are not accountable. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking at the Nehawu National Conference at the Birchwood Hotel in Boksburg, Gauteng, yesterday, said South Africa needs leaders who will listen to the cries and concerns of the people.&ldquo;The country needs leaders who will deliver on their promises,&rdquo; he said.Ramaphosa was in a campaigning mood as he addressed the union delegates, telling them they had an opportunity to elect credible leadership at the ANC elective conference in December. He told delegates they had the opportunity to elect leaders who would not line their pockets but strive to better the lives of the people. &ldquo;After the December conference we will be engaging in the battle of battles. We will be intensifying the 2019 election campaign,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are those who are already buying suits and dresses preparing to occupy the Union Building. They are pretenders to the throne and we must make sure their suits and dresses remain in their wardrobes.&rdquo;Ramaphosa said the union&rsquo;s policy conference at the weekend was an opportunity to examine what went wrong and how things could be fixed.He said a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture must be established to clear the air.
