THE battle lines for the presidency of the ANC were drawn sharper this weekend.Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa&rsquo;s bid got a boost on Saturday when Gauteng ANC chairman Paul Mashatile endorsed him.Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma received roars of approval from the ANC Youth League at a packed hall in Polokwane, Limpopo.Mashatile praised Ramaphosa as a leader who would instil confidence and protect the country from all forms of capture.&ldquo;Our message is very clear &ndash; we will get the ANC back on the right path,&rdquo; Mashatile said.Ramaphosa has previously also been endorsed by ANC leaders in the Northern Cape.Even though the ANC in Limpopo is highly divided on who should succeed Jacob Zuma as the ruling party president in December, Dlamini-Zuma keeps on gaining support there. The Jack Botes Hall in Polokwane was packed when she delivered the Peter Mokaba memorial lecture on Thursday evening. She pleaded with ANC branches to back her in her quest to become the president of the ANC.The lecture was organised by the provincial youth league to commemorate Youth Month. ANCYL leader Collen Maine told the former African Union chairwoman that most young people were unemployed and needed her help if she became president.&ldquo;Young people want you to assist in scrapping experience as a requirement before they can be hired. &ldquo;Because of the high rate of unemployment, they have nowhere where they can gain experience,&rdquo; said Maine.
