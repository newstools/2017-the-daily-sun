A TAXI strike across Gauteng province for today was declared yesterday.This means thousands of commuters will be left stranded and will be forced to look for alternative transport to work and school.Taxis will be taking their complaints to the South African Taxi Finance offices in Midrand and massive delays are expected on parts of the N1 and other routes.Santaco decided to embark on the protest because of the escalating cost of the Toyota Quantum since it was introduced to the country 10 years ago.Yesterday, Santaco&rsquo;s Gauteng chairman, Ralph Jones said they will go to the office to hand over a memorandum of grievances to the directors of the company. Some members of the taxi industry have been hard hit by an interest rate of 28% and blacklisting due to payments of R15 000 per month over 72 months.JMPD spokesman Wayne Minnaar said Santaco have been granted permission to march and officers will be on the routes to direct traffic.
