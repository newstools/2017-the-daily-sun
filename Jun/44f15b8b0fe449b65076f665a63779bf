BENJAMIN Gunduwane is angry with Loate police for allegedly assaulting him and smashing his bedroom window.The 22-year-old from Winterveld, near Mabopane, north of Tshwane, claimed he was sleeping with his girlfriend when the cops conducted an unannounced visit in the early morning.&ldquo;I heard a loud knock at 4am in the next room. I was still groggy, and before I understood what was happening, they kicked the door down,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;A few seconds later, there was a loud knock on my bedroom window. I was scared to death and I did not open my mouth.&ldquo;It was dark and I didn&rsquo;t know what was waiting for me on the other side of the window.&rdquo;Benjamin said the next thing he heard was the glass in his window breaking.&ldquo;I jumped out of bed and I saw guns pointed at me. That&rsquo;s when I realised it was the police,&rdquo; he claimed.Benjamin claimed that the cops sprayed pepper spray into his room and told him to open the door. &ldquo;When I opened it, they grabbed me and began assaulting me. Then they took me to the police station.&rdquo; He said he was only told at the cop shop that his girlfriend&rsquo;s parents had laid a charge of cellphone theft against him.&ldquo;I want them to pay for this.&rdquo;Loate police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said they will investigate and deal with the matter accordingly.&ldquo;After a proper investigation is done, we will call the victim to come to the station and a case will be opened against the cops who assaulted him,&rdquo; he said.
