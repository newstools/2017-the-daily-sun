SENKGANE Pooe is a miserable man.He believes the name his late mkhulu gave him was a curse on him.His name means: Don&rsquo;t reject me.The 33-year-old man from section D2 in Mamelodi said he didn&rsquo;t remember when last he had a girlfriend.And when he dated, he was never in a relationship for more than two weeks. His grandfather died a single man and now Senkgane is afraid he will suffer the same fate.&ldquo;My mother told me the family needed to perform an ancestral ritual to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t affected by the curse. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t believe my mum because I thought she was superstitious, and when my relationships didn&rsquo;t work out I didn&rsquo;t think much of it.&rdquo; he said.But ten years later, Senkgane said he realised his mum was telling the truth.&ldquo;All the girls I&rsquo;ve dated dump me after just two weeks of dating. They don&rsquo;t give me any reason,&rdquo; he said.Senkgane said he tried changing his name to Lucky but nothing changed.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried going to the men&rsquo;s clinic, thinking the problem was with my manhood. &ldquo;I also consulted sangomas, but nothing has helped.&rdquo; Sangoma Sibongile Maluleka said Senkgane must go to his grandfather&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s graves to perform rituals.&ldquo;He must get an elder in the family to go with him and ask for luck from the ancestors,&rdquo; she said.
