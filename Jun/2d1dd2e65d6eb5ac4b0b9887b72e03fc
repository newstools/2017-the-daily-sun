IVAN Semwanga lived a very lavish lifestyle and kept up his game to his grave.The man who called himself Moreki was a member of the Rich Gang, and he was buried like a king at Namirembe Cathedral in Kampala, Uganda.Standing next to Moreki&rsquo;s tiled grave, one of the gang members opened a bottle of champagne and poured half into the grave. Then he handed it to another member who emptied it.The crowd cheered as one of the members made a speech while throwing money into the grave. Other members of the gang, all dressed in black, pulled out bundles of cash from their pockets and flicked R100 and R200 notes into the grave as the luxurious coffin was lowered.Ivan made news in Mzansi after he was seen handing out money to women standing in a queue.The 39-year-old used to invite people to his house and shower them with cash. He was known to dish out money at clubs. He died last Thursday at Steve Biko Hospital in Tshwane after being in a coma for 12 days. He lived in Tshwane for more that five years. Ivan left behind three sons. George Kanyoza, chairman of the Mzansi-based Ugandan community, said: &ldquo;Ivan was good to all people and didn&rsquo;t want to see people suffering. We&rsquo;ll remember him for all the good he did for the poor.&rdquo;
