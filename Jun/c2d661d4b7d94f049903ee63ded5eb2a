THE Gcabashe family needs help.They want the SPCA to take their dogs away. &ldquo;The dogs are creating enemies for us in the village,&rdquo; said Nonhlanhla Gcabashe from Umvoti Village, Maphumulo in KZN.She said they got the five dogs because they wanted protection, but now they are forced to let them go.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what has caused the dogs to be so aggressive, because we&rsquo;ve kept them for many years and there was no problem.&rdquo;She said the dogs had become aggressive and had started biting people who come near their home.Nonhlanhla said the sudden change of behaviour and biting began late last year. Every time the dogs bite a neighbour, Nonhlanhla must hire a car to take the victim to the clinic. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have money because most of us don&rsquo;t work. We can&rsquo;t run away from paying because they are our dogs. But we are losing money because of these animals,&rdquo; said Nonhlanhla. &ldquo;The SPCA vets came and injected them. But it has been a while since they visited the village. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what caused the sudden change of behaviour.&rdquo;Krystal Pretorius, inspector at Durban and Coast SPCA asked for the owner&rsquo;s contact details.&ldquo;Our field officer at the Ballito SPCA will contact the owner to arrange collection of the unwanted dogs.&rdquo;
