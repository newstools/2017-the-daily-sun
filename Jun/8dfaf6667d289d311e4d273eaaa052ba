FADED hip hop star Pitch Black Afro might spend winter months on the streets of Jozi.&nbsp; This after he was allegedly booted out of his flat for failing to pay his rent last week.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has learnt that the Matofotofo hitmaker (real name Thulani Ngcobo) was allegedly kicked to the curb last Friday for being unable to keep up with the R3&thinsp;500 per month rent payment at a Honeydew Ridge flat he shared with a friend.&nbsp; According to sources close to the situation, the singer was allegedly behind by R7&thinsp;000.&nbsp; The other half is paid by kwaito artist Malungelo &ldquo;Drenko&rdquo; Khamago.&nbsp; When contacted by Sunday Sun last week, Drenko refused to comment.&nbsp; The SunTeam understands the two moved into the flat in 2015 to be close to their producers.&nbsp; Our source alleged Pitch Black Afro had been working &ldquo;piece jobs&rdquo; to pay rent and put food on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been trying really hard to bounce back into the music game, but things aren&rsquo;t going well for him,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; When asked to comment, Pitch Black Afro denied being kicked out of the flat, saying he left because the contract with his record company was over.&nbsp; He refused to mention the record stable by name.&nbsp; &ldquo;I left peacefully, my man. I was never kicked out. I left to start a new life for myself,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Our mole added that the star&rsquo;s life was made more difficult by the fact that he didn&rsquo;t own a car &ndash; resulting in him being late for &ldquo;important&rdquo; appointments.&nbsp; Another source claimed to have negotiated with organisers of the Back 2 Oldskool Music Festival for him to be included in the line-up.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the problems with him is that he doesn&rsquo;t want people to know he&rsquo;s broke and struggling.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s embarrassed by his financial situation,&rdquo; claimed the source.&nbsp; This friend said the musician asked him for accommodation, but at the time he didn&rsquo;t know what was happening in Pitch Black Afro&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; &ldquo;He asked me if I could accommodate him for a few months until he was back on his feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The source further said he loaned Pitch Black cash for transport three days before the festival, but refused to say how much.&nbsp; Pitch Black Afro first won the hearts of Mzansi hip hop fans in 2004 with the album, Styling Gel, produced by DJ Cleo.&nbsp;
