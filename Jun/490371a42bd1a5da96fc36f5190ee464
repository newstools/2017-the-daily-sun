THESE abandoned buildings are a headache for residents.The people of Suncity near Kwamhlanga, Mpumalanga claimed the buildings, which are near the kasi shopping complex, are used by nyaope boys. They claimed they&rsquo;re being robbed by the boys when they come back from the shopping centre. The residents also claimed that the buildings are used by magoshas.Lucas Mtsweni (46) said the structures were built for nothing, because the owners have since disappeared. &ldquo;The abandoned buildings are a headache for residents,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re now occupied by nyaope addicts, and the magoshas use them for their sex business.&ldquo;We want the addicts and magoshas to be removed because no one will account for them if anything happens there.&ldquo;Many women and kids are being killed in the country, and such buildings attract crime. When women and kids come back from the shopping centre, they are robbed near the buildings.&rdquo;Another resident, Thabsile Ntuli (33), said the municipality should do something about the buildings.&ldquo;We request the municipality to make a plan and remove the buildings as soon as possible.
