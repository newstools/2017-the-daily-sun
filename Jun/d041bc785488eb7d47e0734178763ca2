SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS (SAA) board chairperson, Dudu Myeni made a simple mistake when she signed off on an Airbus deal for two aircraft instead of 10.At the Companies Tribunal at the Department of Trade and Industry on Monday, Myeni&rsquo;s counsel Francois van Zyl argued that she acted reasonably in her capacity as board chairperson.In November 2016, the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (CIPC) issued Myeni a notice of compliance. Myeni complied with the notice under protest as a safeguard against criminal prosecution, Van Zyl said.He went on to argue that the notice was invalidly issued, as there was no action for Myeni to cease, rectify or reverse as she had corrected the misunderstanding about the aircraft by July 2016.The Democratic Alliance and the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) are taking Myeni to task by questioning her actions as board chairperson. OUTA filed an application to the North Gauteng High Court to have Myeni declared delinquent over the airline&rsquo;s failures under her watch, with the Airbus deal among these.But Van Zyl says although there was &ldquo;room for confusion&rdquo; concerning the number of aircraft that needed to be financed, he said that Myeni had sought clarity by approaching the company secretary before signing off. Thereafter a letter was set to the minister of public enterprises (Malusi Gigaba) to inform him of the mistake that there were 10 aircraft in question and not two.He said it could not be said that she intentionally misled the minister, because there had been a misunderstanding. &ldquo;If she did so innocently, then bona fides [good faith] comes into play.&rdquo;http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Industrial/saa-airbus-deal-myeni-made-a-simple-mistake-says-lawyer-20170619
