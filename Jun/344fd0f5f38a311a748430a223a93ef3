SOCCER fans have Bafana and Banyana, cricket has its Proteas, and rugby its Amabhokobhoko. And now South Africans who love spinning cars will soon have a team of their own to root for! It was announced that a spinning team would receive national recognition to represent Mzansi at an international spin competition. Wheelz n Smoke launched their Spin Inc series competition on Saturday at their arena, in the south of Joburg, to serve as qualification rounds for those six spinners who will be chosen to take part in the international spin competition, Gymkhana Grid.According to Ndu Ngwenya, spokesman for the arena, the spinners will be chosen from all Mzansi provinces to compete with their counterparts from other countries between 18 and 19 November this year at Carnival City, Ekurhuleni. To qualify for the main event, spinners will be judged on their freestyle, tyre bounce, target line, figure eight, kitchen and side by side. &ldquo;The Gymkhana Grid was started by professional rally driver Ken Block. It&rsquo;s been running in Europe for six years now,&rdquo; said Ndu. Wannie Sixtynine (36) from the Northern Cape&rsquo;s Ride2slide team said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to put the stereotype aside that spinning is only for gangsters.&rdquo;Rio Team GP, known for spinning with his daughter, said for a sport to be a sport, people had to compete against each other. Tina Rossouw (21) from Cape Town said even though she didn&rsquo;t do stunts, she was ready to display her kitchen style skills.A young fan, Delwin Alexander (12) from Eden Park in Ekurhuleni, said he couldn&rsquo;t wait to see his favourite spinner, Skoppas.
