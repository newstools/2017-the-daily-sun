A FIERCE battle has ensued between Black Leopards boss David Thidiela and his coach Jean Losciuto.SunSport has reliably learnt that Thidiela refused to grant his Belgium coach permission to join Absa Premiership side Free State Stars.Losciuto still has two years remaining on his three-year contract with the Venda based side.&nbsp;This is the second time the owner of a Limpopo outfit is involved in an off-the-field squabble with a coach over a potential move to the Free State.&nbsp;Luc Eymael wrestled with Polokwane City boss Johnny Mogaladi when he left them under a cloud to join Bloemfontein Celtic last season.&nbsp;But the war in the boardroom ended bitterly when the Belgian was ordered by the PSL&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee to honour his contract with Rise and Shine.&nbsp;Ironically, Eymael is the one who recommended Losciuto to Thidiela when the Venda outfit was struggling in the first round of the National First Division last season.&nbsp;Losciuto joined Leopards in September last year and helped them move up from 13th position in the NFD table to finish second and qualify for the play-offs.An insider at Leopards says Thidiela changed his mind after Losciuto allegedly went behind his back to entice defender, Ghana&rsquo;s Abbubaker Mumuni, to join Stars with him.&nbsp;Mumuni previously had failed trials at Stars the season before last as the then Ea Lla Koto coach Kinnah Phiri felt he was not good enough. The lanky player ended up signing with Vasco Da Gama (now Stellenbosch FC) where he was released before the start of last season and joined Leopards.&nbsp;Said the insider: &ldquo;Thidiela doesn&rsquo;t want to release the coach because he betrayed him and stole Mumuni. "He initially gave Jean his blessing but was angry when he found out yesterday that his tough defender was leaving the club with Losciuto. That&rsquo;s why he insisted that the coach honour the remainder of his contract.&rdquo; However, a source close to Losciuto said: &ldquo;Jean is not happy either because he has already signed a three-year contract with Stars. "He wanted to test his coaching skills in a bigger league""But it seems his dream won&rsquo;t become a reality, as the matter could end being handled by the PSL&rsquo;s Disciplinary Committee, as was the case with his friend Eymael.&rdquo;Leopards spokesman Barry Ramunenyiwa said: &ldquo;We are disappointed that the coach signed a contract with another team before the play-offs while still contracted to Leopards.&nbsp;&ldquo;We are still waiting for his resignation letter. We have a good working relationship with him and I was surprised to found out about this through the media.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;
