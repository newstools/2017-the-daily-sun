PUPILS at Durban Deep Primary School in Roodepoort, west of Africa&rsquo;s richest city, are without water, electricity, basic sanitation and proper infrastructure. This sad situation has been going on, not for a month or even a year &ndash; but for a full three years!The school uses a generator for electricity and relies on neighbours in the area to give pupils clean water to drink.The school&rsquo;s governing body and management team told the People&rsquo;s Paper that they and parents blame the department of basic education for failing to create a safe, clean environment for their children.Parents said the department did bring mobile toilets to the school, but they were not serviced properly. Water tanks were provided but the water often appeared dirty as the lids don&rsquo;t close properly. Thugs vandalised the school&rsquo;s fence and stole the electricity cables.Abigail Tukula (42) said the pupils have a right to clean water and to be taught in classrooms with electricity.&ldquo;Our children are not safe at all. &ldquo;Their right to education has been violated. &ldquo;Condoms came out of the water tanks. There is no fence at the back of the school, meaning thugs can kidnap our children.&ldquo;The toilets are filthy and broken and our children have no hand-washing facilities.&rdquo; On Thursday a meeting was held to try and resolve the crisis, but representatives from the department failed to turn up.Departmental spokesman Oupa Bodiba promised that officials would be sent to assess the situation at the school.
