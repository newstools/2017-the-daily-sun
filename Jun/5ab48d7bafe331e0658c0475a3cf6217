THUGS bombed an ATM outside the Rainbow Superette and Butchery in Mfuleni near Cape Town, but left with nothing. The incident happened right under the noses of the police at about 1am on Friday morning. The Mfuleni Police Station is situated just across the road. This is the second failed attempt within a week. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;No money was removed from the machine. &ldquo;Although similarities were found in both incidents, it is too early to speculate that they could have been perpetrated by the same suspects. &ldquo;No arrests have been made in both cases. The police are investigating the incidents.&rdquo; People in the area said they were woken up by mild explosions. &ldquo;I was fast asleep inside my shop when two mild bangs woke me up at about 1am,&rdquo; said Masud Masud, who runs the butchery. &ldquo;I was relieved when I saw cops rushing in. &ldquo;They cordoned off the area around the scene immediately.&rdquo; Masud said the second failed robbery attempt had forced him to change his operating hours. &ldquo;I now open my shop at 8am instead of 5am. This will hurt my business, but I have no choice. I don&rsquo;t want to be caught off guard in the dark morning.&rdquo;
