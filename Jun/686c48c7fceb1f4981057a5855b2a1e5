Tshegofatso Mohlalo (8) was hit by a speeding car last July.His gogo, Cecilia Thabeng (57) from Mohlakeng in Mogale City, said when she arrived at the scene, paramedics had already declared him dead. &ldquo;I knelt down and started praying to God to keep him alive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tshegofatso started bleeding from his nose. I continued praying and he slowly moved his fingers. I shouted at the paramedics that he was alive.&rdquo;A helicopter was called and the badly injured boy was airlifted to hospital. He had sustained severe head injuries and was in a coma for 35 days.Gogo Cecilia said Tshegofatso returned home unable to walk or talk.&ldquo;We are grateful that he&rsquo;s alive and call him our own angel. But it has become expensive to take care of him as we are unemployed.&ldquo;Before the accident he was a bright and outgoing boy who loved playing soccer. Now that he is paralysed he is like a baby. He needs nappies and medication every day. &ldquo;We have gone to different doctors who confirmed that he qualifies for a disability grant, but Sassa officials disagree,&rdquo; said Cecilia.Sassa spokeswoman Nandi Mosai said people need to understand that although a doctor may have said someone qualifies for a grant, the department conducts its own test.&ldquo;We cater for people who are critically disabled. If someone is not happy with our decision, they can go to the nearest Sassa office to dispute it.&rdquo;
