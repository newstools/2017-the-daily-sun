TV and radio sports presenter Robert Marawa has boycotted his show.&nbsp; The anchor of the Sports@6 with Marawa show on SABC&rsquo;s Metro FM pulled a vanishing act on Thursday.&nbsp; This after his producer Beverly Maphangwa was handed a suspension letter.&nbsp; The suspension was allegedly prompted by Beverly&rsquo;s decision to allow Robert to play an audio recording of Sizwe Mabena and Baba Mthethwa, both working for DStv&rsquo;s SuperSport, an SABC competitor.&nbsp; According to insiders, Beverly and Robert were informed not to use audio clips from the competitor.&nbsp; Said a source: &ldquo;Robert and Beverly were instructed on what they could and could not do.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another insider said: &ldquo;Management will not haul Robert before a hearing or write him a letter. He did nothing wrong. But management expects Beverly to answer for the audio clips.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robert posted tweets to express his dissatisfactions with the station&rsquo;s management on Thursday evening.&nbsp; SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said they had noted everything he said on social media. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll deal with it internally,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Both Robert and Beverly could not be reached for comment. They also failed to respond to our SMSes at the time of going to press.
