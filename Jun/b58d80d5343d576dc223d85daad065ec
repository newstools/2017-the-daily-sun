Thobela, who is a businessman these days, said they formed TLB Boxing Promotions with the aim of discovering new talented boxers who will become the pride of South Africa.&ldquo;We love boxing,&rdquo; said Thobela. &ldquo;It is close to our hearts, and it is very important that we keep the legacy alive.&ldquo;As TLB Promotions we believe there is still a lot of talent across the country that needs to be moulded to perfection. We need boxers who will represent our country on international stages.&rdquo;Kungwane, the only woman in the partnership, said she was thrilled that youngsters would be getting a platform to showcase their talents.She said: &ldquo;I developed an idea with Christopher and we later put the proposal to Dingaan, Jan and Lehlohonolo, as we knew they were the best people to be part of the plan. Our discussion on how we wanted to take the project forward yielded results, and we later registered a boxing promotions company.&rdquo; Thobela said TLB had acquired a trading licence from Boxing South Africa.&ldquo;We had discussions with BSA about our ambitions and got a trading licence to be able to operate. We have two gyms at the moment, in Soweto and Boksburg. &ldquo;Our boxers are already training and we are looking forward to officially launching TLB Boxing Promotions in July,&rdquo; said Thobela.
