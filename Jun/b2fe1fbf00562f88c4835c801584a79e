KWAITO star L&rsquo;vovo Derrango and house music producers, Infinite Boys, are allegedly at loggerheads.&nbsp; Showbiz insiders claim the musicians are warring over a song that was produced for L&rsquo;vovo late last year.&nbsp; Said the first source: &ldquo;L&rsquo;vovo blames Infinite Boys (Raphael and Tony Mabaso) for not giving him the beat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, the song was produced and handed to him. But to this day, he&rsquo;s been dragging his feet on releasing.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the source, L&rsquo;vovo had promised to pay the boys once the song had been released.&nbsp; &ldquo;The song was to form part of his last album, which won him a Metro FM Award. It&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s playing delaying tactics, as far as releasing the song is concerned. Adding vocals to it was the only thing he had to do to the production,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how L&rsquo;vovo operates. The boys gave him the song as he requested. But now, since winning the award, he&rsquo;s just relaxed and forgotten all about the boys. He&rsquo;s pushing his other things in the industry. I mean, it&rsquo;s really unfair what he&rsquo;s doing to these guys.&rdquo;&nbsp; A second source claimed the kwaito star had promised Infinite Boys the song would be released in March.&nbsp; &ldquo;But to this day, there&rsquo;s nothing. He&rsquo;s busy pushing his single, Ama Hundred, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about what&rsquo;s in his hard drive.&rdquo;&nbsp; When contacted for comment, L&rsquo;vovo passed the buck to the Infinite Boys, saying: &ldquo;I gave them the vocals. But I guess, I&rsquo;ll have to sort it out. It&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Infinite Boys said: &ldquo;We gave him what&rsquo;s due to him and are waiting for him to edit the vocals as agreed. But it&rsquo;s way overdue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right now, we&rsquo;re busy in the studio with our single.&rdquo;
