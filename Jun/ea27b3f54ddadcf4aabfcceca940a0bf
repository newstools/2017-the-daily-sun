ZIMBABWE hopes to capitalise on its home ground advantage when hosting Liberia for its opening Group G, 2019 Caf Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at National Sports Stadium in Harare today.&nbsp; Kick-off is at 3pm.&nbsp; Caretaker coach Norman Mapeza is aware of the huge task in front of him and will aim to start Zim&rsquo;s campaign with a win.&nbsp; Replacing the sacked coach in Kalisto Pasuwa means the former Warriors international has to improve on his country&rsquo;s hopes for continental tournaments.&nbsp; Despite leading the team to the Afcon tournament in Gabon for the first time since 2006, the Zimbabwean Football Association parted ways with Pasuwa.&nbsp; Mapeza has led the team once, when they drew 0-0 against Zambia&rsquo;s Chipolopolo in March, and his mission will be to score his first win since taking charge of the side.&nbsp; And this means the coach will have to find ways to unlock Liberia&rsquo;s defence, and Zim will have to do this without key striker Khama Billiat, who plies his trade at Mamelodi Sundowns in Mzansi. An ankle injury will keep him off the pitch.&nbsp; On the other hand, the presence of Belgium-based striker Knowledge Musona could cause all kinds of trouble for the visitors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Liberia will be coming here to fight, so we are trying to take each game as it comes,&rdquo; Musona said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Consequently, we are looking at this match, and then we&rsquo;ll see how it goes when we resume next year.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, like what we did last time when we started at home, we&rsquo;ll also end the campaign well. So, we need to work hard.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shifting focus to the Lone Stars, Liberia will come with a crippled squad, thanks to the absence of Billiat&rsquo;s club teammate at Sundowns, Anthony Laffor.&nbsp; Coach James Debbah has a task to motivate his men and ensure they remain disciplined at the back, so they claim at least a point.&nbsp; The Liberians are fresh from a 1-0 win over Sierra Leone in an international friendly on 5 June. So, they&rsquo;ll land in Harare in high spirits.&nbsp; Liberia had reached the tournament on two occasions in 1996 and 2001, but failed to progress beyond the group stages on both attempts.&nbsp; In their next match, the Liberians will welcome the Democratic Republic of Congo in March, so a win in Harare will boost the side&rsquo;s morale.&nbsp; Although the two nations have met twice in the qualifiers, the first encounter produced a mere draw.&nbsp; The second one was a victory for the Zimbabweans.&nbsp; &ndash; BackpageTXT&nbsp;
