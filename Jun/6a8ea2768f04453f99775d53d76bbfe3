SECRETARY to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana has been "granted" special leave from today by Speaker Baleka Mbete and NCOP chairwoman Thandi Modise following a raft of corruption allegations.Mbete said they have referred several allegations regarding administrative irregularities against Mgidlana to an "independent audit committee" of Parliament for investigation.Mbete stressed that Mgidlana remains innocent until proven otherwise.One of the two deputy secretaries to Parliament will be appointed to act while he is on leave.But Nehawu's Parliament branch said they were not happy with Mgidlana going on special because it meant he would sit at home and earn a salary."We are saying no to special leave. Mgidlana should be suspended, no special preferential treatment. We are sick and tired," said branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe.Among other things, ,Mgidlana is accused of irregularly &nbsp;hiring senior management staff amid a budget crunch, awarding himself an education bursary at the expense of junior staff, and embarking on "wasteful and unauthorised" overseas trips.The call also comes in the middle of a wage negotiation between Parliament and the union, after it was announced Parliament workers would receive a 0% salary increase this financial year.Tembe accused Mgidlana of negotiating in bad faith.Failure to suspend Mgidlana would lead them to the view that he was "untouchable", a "golden boy" and accorded preferential treatment.Mgidlana denies all the allegations, dismissing them as &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; and &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/secretary-to-parliament-granted-special-leave-20170609
