WHEN he came back home after spending two months away working, a 27-year-old man found his girlfriend poking another man in their bed! He was overcome by anger and allegedly set the house on fire, leaving the girlfriend (31) and her lover with serious burn wounds! The incident in Thokgoaneng Village, outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo, left the couple&rsquo;s seven- roomed house gutted.The woman and her boyfriend were rushed to Lebowakgomo Hospital, but luckily three kids in the house when the fire started were able to escape unharmed. Elisa Ntjana (58), a relative of the suspect, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;He came to my house to give me his ID book to keep before going back home. There was no sign of unhappiness on his face and I had no idea something bad was about to happen. &ldquo;I later saw that his house was burning. I went there with another relative and we found him sitting on a chair outside, watching the flames. His girlfriend and her lover were badly burned.&rdquo; Elisa said she wished the suspect had told her what was wrong so that she could have called a family meeting to sort the problem out peacefully. She said the man and his girlfriend had been living together peacefully for eight years and they were planning to marry. Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspect was arrested after he handed himself in to the cops. &ldquo;He was charged with attempted murder and arson and he will appear in Thabamoopo Magistrates Court soon,&rdquo; he said. Ngoepe appealed to community members not to turn to violence when they experience domestic problems. He said they should rather consult the local authorities for professional advice.
