BUTI Manamela has encouraged young people to start volunteering.The deputy minister in the presidency was speaking at a youth volunteer conference at Leriba Lodge in Centurion, Tshwane, on Tuesday.The conference was attended by more that 100 young entrepreneurs from different provinces. Manamela said about 66% of Mzansi&rsquo;s population were young people, and they needed to take a stand.&ldquo;When a person volunteers, they should not concentrate on getting a stipend.&rdquo;He said the National Youth Development Agency, together with Flemish government, had agreed on a new structure for the 2015-2020 partnership. &ldquo;The aim of the partnership is to cultivate an enabling environment for the youth volunteering to civil society,&rdquo; he said.He said this would help to develop the culture of volunteering by offering the youth different quality opportunities.&ldquo;Such partnerships are essential, as South Africa is in the process of reformulating the National Youth Service framework,&rdquo; he said.Manamela said the partnership with the Flemish government would be based on knowledge generation, capacity building, marketing and lobbying advocacy.&ldquo;These will help to promote youth volunteering in civil society,&rdquo; he said.He said he was concerned about the killings and abductions of young women in the country. &ldquo;We have a responsibility to educate society on such issues,&rdquo; he said.Flemish minister of culture and media affairs, Sven Gatz, said they had been working with the youth agency since 1996. He said he had seen a lot of changes in the country.&ldquo;It makes me happy to see young entrepreneurs taking part to improve their country,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Volunteering in a global community can contribute greatly towards the growth of the youth.&rdquo;
