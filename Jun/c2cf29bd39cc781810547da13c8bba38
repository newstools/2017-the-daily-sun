BIDVEST Wits veteran goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs has no intention of retiring.The former Bafana Bafana star, who helped the Clever Boys win their first league title in the club&rsquo;s 96-year history, says he has one more goal to achieve &ndash; winning the Caf Champions League.Said Josephs: &ldquo;The last thing on my mind is retiring. I&rsquo;ll carry on playing until they tell me to stop or to make way for a younger, up-and-coming keeper. But I have no plans to retire anytime soon.&rdquo;You just can&rsquo;t keep a good man down. Wits head coach Gavin Hunt, realising he needed a second top keeper if he wanted to win the league, brought in Darren Keet and the two have complemented each other, also providing necessary competition that Hunt said went a long way in ensuring Wits&rsquo; championship success.Underlining how important Josephs is to Wits, the keeper was named Premiership Player of the Month for May yesterday. Josephs has now won the Premiership three times &ndash; twice with Orlando Pirates &ndash; and has won every domestic knockout trophy on offer. Now he wants to conquer Africa with Wits.Said Josephs: &ldquo;People keep saying we (Wits) don&rsquo;t take Africa seriously. Believe me, we do. And we will go all out to try and win it next year. &ldquo;We are determined to make our mark in Africa. We got a really tough draw this year, with Al Ahly of Egypt in the first round. &ldquo;But we learned from that experience and will be better prepared to take on the best in Africa this time.&rdquo; Like good wine, Josephs is getting better with age. And at 37 he believes he still has plenty to offer.He was full of praise for the Clever Boys head coach Hunt, who previously won back-to-back league titles with SuperSport United.Said Josephs: &ldquo;Gavin is a complete &lsquo;nutcase&rsquo; when it comes to winning.&ldquo; That&rsquo;s what he is all about &ndash; winning. Nothing else matters. &ldquo;He is the driving force behind this team and he will bring more success to the club with his positive, winning mentality which has rubbed off onto the players. I actually enjoy coming to training. &ldquo;We may not be the best squad but we are the ones that work the hardest and that&rsquo;s why we won the double. &ldquo;I want to be around when Gavin wins more trophies. When he tells me to get a hammer and nail, and hang up my boots then I will. &ldquo;Until then I still have the fire and passion to continue playing for him.&rdquo;
