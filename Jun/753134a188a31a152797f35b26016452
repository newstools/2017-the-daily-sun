EASTERN Cape police believe they have nipped a bloody taxi war in the bud after they broke up a fight at the taxi rank in Jeffreys Bay on Tuesday. Had police not been in the right place at the right time, more blood would have flowed. This comes after two suspects aged 26 and 45 were bust when shots rang out. Innocent commuters and people ran in all directions. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: &ldquo;Police nipped the looming taxi violence in the bud and arrested two male suspects. &ldquo;They were charged with attempted murder and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. &ldquo;Police acted swiftly after receiving a complaint about the fighting at the taxi rank in Ocean View at about 8.30am on Tuesday morning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alleged that two groups assaulted each other. Shots were fired by community members. &ldquo;Police intervened and the groups were dispersed. &ldquo;No fatalities were reported, but three men were taken to hospital for medical treatment. &ldquo;The two suspects will appear in the Humansdorp Magistrates Court. Police cannot rule out the possibility of more arrests.&rdquo;
