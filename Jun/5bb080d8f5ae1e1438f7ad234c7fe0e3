ANGRY residents stormed the local cop shop yesterday after the victims of a housebreaking, rather than the alleged thugs, were bust!Residents of Dobsonville in Soweto said cops seem unwilling to keep them safe.Victim Sizakele Mashini told Daily Sun: &ldquo;On Tuesday I was sitting at home when two thugs tried to break into my house.&ldquo;They jumped over my wall and smashed a window. &ldquo;I feared for my life and called my neighbours. &ldquo;People came rushing to help and they chased after the boys and caught them.&rdquo; According to residents, the boys had also robbed a woman of her cellphone. The people beat them up before taking them to the police station. The cops released them, however, and said there was no evidence they had broken into Sizakele&rsquo;s house. People got furious then when Sizak-ele and her husband were arrested for kidnap and assault. Lethabo Seduko (45) said: &ldquo;We were forced to take the law into our own hands as the useless cops are doing little to protect us.&rdquo; Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed that Sizakele and her husband were arrested. &ldquo;Victims of crime who feel they are not helped at the police station should inform the commander. But community members should not take the law into their own hands,&rdquo; he said.
