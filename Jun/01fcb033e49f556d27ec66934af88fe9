THE ANC veterans and stalwarts have missed an opportunity to help the party correct itself. Secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the NEC agreed to put aside two days of the National Policy Conference on their request to reflect. The ANC will be holding the conference at Nasrec in Joburg before the December elective conference. &ldquo;If you walk away from that opportunity you miss out,&rdquo; Mantashe said. He said the stalwarts and the party&rsquo;s negotiation team could not agree on critical issues such as delegates to the consultative conference, and its terms. &ldquo;We are still going to use the two days to reflect on the organisation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t come with a good story. It must be a candid report back.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mantashe said they are not going to allow delegates to be bullied into submission and will encourage debate. &ldquo;Yes, state capture is going to be discussed and in detail. Economic challenges will be dealt with because we need to come out of here with clarity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mantashe said they were not expecting any disruptions. &ldquo;Anyone coming to the conference bent on disrupting will be disrupted themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The conference is expected to be used by the factions to test the waters ahead of the December elective conference. &ldquo;We will not allow songs to hurt individuals,&rdquo; he said. Mantashe said President Zuma is expected to present an overview of the challenges facing the party today.&nbsp;
