BAFANA Bafana striker Tokelo Rantie was in a bullish mood ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s opening 2019 Caf Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria at Gods&shy;will Akpabio International Stadium. Kick-off is at 6pm SA time.In a rare interview, Rantie said he had a good feeling that tomorrow would be a good day for Bafana.Rantie was the Super Eagles&rsquo; tormentor two years ago when he scored two goals in the 2015 Afcon qualifier at the same venue.&ldquo;The time for us to fear Nigeria is long gone and I have an exciting feeling that we will do well. I have no stress and no fear at all because we have the players to bring them down,&rdquo; he said.He said it was good to be back in the team after missing some games because of his stand-off with Safa.&ldquo;It came at the right time, I am doing well at club level. Things happened but I&rsquo;m here now and have been given a second chance,&rdquo; said Rantie.He said they wanted to be the first crop of players to beat Nigeria: &ldquo;We have a chance and all the tools to cause problems in the game. They are humans like us and we are not scared of them.&rdquo;The 26-year-old striker said he was enjoying his football again after enduring a tough time in England. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t start well because I had to adjust to the league but fortunately my manager believed in me and gave me confidence. There has been progress in my game and I am happy.&rdquo;Rantie struggled to break into the Bournemouth side when he was still in the English Premier League but said this had nothing to do with his game. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe me &ndash; when I moved from Malmo the coach came to watch me play and was happy. But then when I got to England, my height became a problem, as it didn&rsquo;t suit his style of play. I thought I deserved a chance. That&rsquo;s the only reason I was not playing.&rdquo;He said when he moved to Turkey it was more about proving a point and he thinks he has done that. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I am the best but I am a hard worker. &ldquo;My game has improved a lot and my game has evolved, as I am more aware now than before.&rdquo;ALSO SEE PAGE 30.
