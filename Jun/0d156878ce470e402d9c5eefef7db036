MAROBELE Mankge (43) from Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, has every reason to curse taxi drivers. This is because taximen allegedly assaulted and stripped him naked! Marobele said his only sin was that he refused to get in their taxi. Marobele told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I have never been so humiliated in my life. I was beaten until I was unconscious. &ldquo;To rub salt in the wound, these boys who attacked me are young enough to be my sons.&rdquo;Marobele said the incident happened a week ago.&ldquo;I was waiting for my cousin in the open veld next to the N12 to give me a ride home. &ldquo;Taximen approached me and said I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to wait there if I was not catching a taxi. I told them it was an open space and not a taxi rank.&rdquo;He said they replied that he had no business being there and they would give him five minutes to leave.&ldquo;They promised that they would teach me a lesson if they returned and still found me there. &ldquo;After a few minutes, they returned with friends. Without warning, they started assaulting me. I was kicked, punched and even bashed with a knobkerrie until I collapsed, unconscious.&ldquo;When I regained consciousness, they stripped me naked and made me take a walk of shame. &ldquo;They took my phone, R1 400, my watch, shoes and wallet.&rdquo;Kempton Park police spokesman Captain Jethro Mtshali confirmed that cases of assault and robbery were opened.&ldquo;No arrests have been made at this stage. The matter is being investigated,&rdquo; he said.
