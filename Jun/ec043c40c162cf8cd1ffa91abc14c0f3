MUSICIAN and dancer Cici has poured cold water on claims that she has kissed and made up with kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate. The singer, whose real name is Busisiwe Thwala, told Daily Sun she wasn&rsquo;t planning on dropping assault charges against Arthur. Earlier this month, it came to light that she had opened a case against Arthur after he allegedly dragged her behind his car following an argument. Cici told the SunTeam: &ldquo;As far as I know, charges against Arthur are still pending and I have no intention of dropping them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to get into the merits of the case at this stage as the matter is in the hands of the police and the NPA. &ldquo;However, I will speak openly at the appropriate stage.&rdquo; She urged the media and her fans to ignore any reports indicating she would not be continuing with the criminal case. Arthur told the SunTeam he would not be speaking about the matter as the case was still sub judice. Earlier this month, Cici posted a horrific photo on Instagram of her scar, following hip replacement surgery. The picture was accompanied by the hashtag BreakTheSilence. Cici wrote in her post: &ldquo;The operation was a success. Wish to walk again.&rdquo; Hip replacement surgery involves a damaged hip joint being replaced with an artificial one. The police confirmed that a case was opened at Midrand Police Station in Gauteng. Arthur was released on R500 bail and is due to appear in the Midrand Magistrates Court soon.
