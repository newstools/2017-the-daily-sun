AFTER years of complaining about a sewage spill in the area, residents of Hillside location near Fort Beaufort say the drain was never fixed. Zoleka Gysman, who lives next to the stinking spillage, said they&rsquo;ve been complaining about the leak and the unpleasant smell to authorities but nothing has been done. &ldquo;They just send us people who come and have a look. They promise to come back but they never do,&rdquo; she said.Zoleka said spills from untreated sewage cause all sorts of health risks.&ldquo;This situation becomes worse when it rains. &ldquo;The sewage overflows into our yards and the smell is unbearable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The biggest threat is that our kids play next to the area. They might get sick or die.&rdquo;Zoleka said some of the drains in the area had been fixed. &ldquo;But they failed to fix this particular one.&rdquo; Amathole municipal spokeswoman Nonceba Vuso said she will forward the complaint to the relevant department. &ldquo;This issue will be referred to the engineering department. They are familiar with issues of this nature. &ldquo;After receiving feedback from them, I will give you information about that matter.&rdquo;
