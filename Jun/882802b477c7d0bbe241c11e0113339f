&ldquo;IT&rsquo;S not your time to die . . . open your eyes!&rdquo; This is what Pastor Paseka &ldquo;Mboro&rdquo; Motsoeneng said to 97-year-old gogo Wilhelmina Phiri when she collapsed on Saturday morning &ndash; and miraculously, she regained consciousness! Mboro then picked the gogo up and everyone cheered. Mourners at Wilhelmina&rsquo;s mum, Johanna Ramatse&rsquo;s funeral in Mokone Block in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, could not believe their eyes. Johanna died at the age of 136 last Thursday. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral and the service was so emotional for gogo Wilhelmina that she collapsed in her chair. One of the mourners said what Mboro did was unbelievable. &ldquo;We thought she was dead, but after Mboro prayed for her she opened her eyes!&rdquo; When Daily Sun contacted Mboro, he said what happened was a miracle from God. &ldquo;When I touched her, I realised she had succumbed to death.&ldquo;I spoke to God and asked him to extend her living years,&rdquo; he said. Mboro had earlier built a new house for the gogo and her family. &ldquo;The old woman wanted to die because she feared she would be alone and no one would help her family but I will always be there for them.&rdquo;Mboro built the house for the family after hearing the one they previously lived in was falling apart.
