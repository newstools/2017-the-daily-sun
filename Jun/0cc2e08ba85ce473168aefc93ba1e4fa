THE city of Cape Town has embarked on a programme to prevent standing water.Residents of Khayelitsha&rsquo;s BM Section have been jumping over a pool of water in front of their toilets for many years.Mayoral committee member for safety, JP Smith, and a team from the disaster risk management centre visited the area where public works programme workers were digging waterways. Smith told Daily Sun he got the idea from Langa kasi.&ldquo;When we went to zone 30 in Langa there was a big problem with stagnant water. &ldquo;Instead of complaining, two men from the area picked up spades and started digging a small furrow, leading water to the nearest drainage point. All the water slowly leaked away,&rdquo; said Smith.&ldquo;We have decided to employ 20 local residents to deal with stagnant water around the township over a 10-day period.&rdquo;Winter readiness team manager Enock Kopele said the project will be rolled out to other affected areas too.
