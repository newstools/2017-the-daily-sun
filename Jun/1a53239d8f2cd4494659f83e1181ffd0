When the armed men arrived, he was not there.“The suspects began by breaking the boyfriend’s windows and all hell broke loose. “They allegedly began to assault patrons, passersby, bystanders and everyone else in the vicinity,” said Matimulane.A 37-year-old man who came to the tavern just to enjoy a drink was beaten to death!“He was assaulted and sustained serious injuries to the head. He died from his injuries while in hospital,” said Matimulane.Police said the suspects could face additional charges, provided that those assaulted on the day come forward to make statements. Ivory Park station commander Brigadier David Ngcobo said: “We thank all of those who opened up to the police by giving statements under oath to help trace the suspects.” The suspects are expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrates Court soon.
