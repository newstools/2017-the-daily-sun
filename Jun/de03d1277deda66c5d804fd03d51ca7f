THESE neighbours have been at each other&rsquo;s throats for three years.Their fight is over a wall separating their yards. Christina Simo (47) from Freedom Park, south of Joburg, has been unhappy since her neighbour, Phineas Buthelezi (58) first erected the wall and rooms on her property. Christina has demolished the wall several times, but every time Phineas builds it again. The SunTeam was on the scene when the two got into yet another fight on Friday. This was after Christina broke down the wall again. &ldquo;Since 2014 I have been telling him not to invade my yard, but he has even built rooms on my side,&rdquo; said Christina.&ldquo;One of the rooms is an indumba for his sangoma daughter. I want him to demolish the rooms and build the wall where he was supposed to after being told by housing officials.&rdquo; Christina said she had called housing officials many times, and Phineas admitted invading her yard. Phineas told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I do not have a problem demolishing the wall, but it is not possible with the rooms because people live in them.&ldquo;I will beg Christina for mercy.&rdquo;
