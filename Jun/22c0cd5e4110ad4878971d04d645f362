NORTHERN Cape Police Commissioner Risimati Shivuri is being accused of using a state chopper to go for breakfast at a Wimpy in Colesberg. But SAPS spokeswoman Major-General Sally de Beer said this was not the case. &ldquo;We are not disputing the allegation, but the commissioner was performing his duties when he was spotted.&rdquo; The Northern Cape DA is not buying the story and has challenged transport MEC Alexandra Beukes to produce the helicopter&rsquo;s log book.&ldquo;We have written to Beukes, asking her to use her powers to make public the helicopter&rsquo;s flight log. We also forwarded the information to Ipid,&rdquo; said the DA&rsquo;s Melinda Hattingh.Shivuri allegedly took the helicopter to have breakfast at the Wimpy 4km from where the ANC was holding its elective conference two weeks ago. He is also accused of sending the helicopter on a 30km trip to retrieve a jacket he had left at Gariep Dam.A Colesberg resident who was at the Wimpy said it was like watching a scene from a James Bond movie. &ldquo;I could not believe my eyes when I saw a helicopter landing next to our Wimpy for breakfast. It&rsquo;s something one cannot easily forget.&rdquo; Deputy national police commissioner Stefan Schutte has told parliament the use of the helicopter is being investigated. &ldquo;Let us let it run its course.&rdquo; According to Hattingh, the DA wants Ipid to investigate who authorised the trip. It also wants to look into the law regarding an individual using state property for personal use.
