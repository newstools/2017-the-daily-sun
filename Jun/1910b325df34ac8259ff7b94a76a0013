THE Guptas are destroying the ANC!This was Tokyo Sexwale&rsquo;s outcry yesterday when he discussed Advocate Geoff Budlender&rsquo;s report into the investigation of Gupta-linked company Trillian Capital, of which he was chairman.Budlender&rsquo;s report revealed shocking corruption linked to the Guptas.Sexwale called for the report to be included in a judicial inquiry and also announced he was resigning from the company after the press conference.He singled out 60% shareholder Salim Essa for many Trillian corruption problems and said Essa refused to meet him.He lashed out at the Gupta family, saying they had destroyed the ANC.&ldquo;This corruption of state capture is destroying my organisation,&rdquo; he said.Budlender slammed Trillian&rsquo;s lack of co-operation with his probe and said management&rsquo;s conduct in the inquiry led him to believe what it said couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. &ldquo;They have obstructed this investigation. The question is why.&rdquo; Budlender said the investigation was unfinished and more work is needed to highlight the full scope of corruption.
