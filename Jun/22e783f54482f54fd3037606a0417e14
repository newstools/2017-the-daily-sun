MANY young people in rural areas don&rsquo;t get the information they need on how they can continue their studies when they finish matric.That is why Coca-Cola came up with a travelling career expo . . . They visit areas in need that are identified by their ambassadors!On Friday, the ambassadors held an expo at Mbopha High School in KwaHlabisa, northern KZN.Hundreds of matriculants from high schools in the area, as well as young people who passed matric in the past few years, attended the event.They were equipped with much-needed information on what they should do to pursue their studies. Samuel Nkosi from the community social investment department told Daily Sun the event was a great success.&ldquo;Sometimes, young people from deep rural areas are neglected or excluded from programmes that can help them get more information on how to choose the right career path,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Some never get to study at tertiary level. &ldquo;They sit at home after finishing matric.&ldquo;Through our ambassadors, we identify young people who will benefit from information. &ldquo;This is our second visit to this area.&rdquo; A few tertiary institutions were invited to the expo so they could provide first-hand information on how young people can make wise choices.At the event, nine young people received laptops from former premier, Senzo Mchunu.Mbopha High School pupil, Nosihle Zondo, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I am happy that the career expo came to our area. We need this kind of information so that we can know about all the educational opportunities out there.&ldquo;If we make the right choices and work hard, we&rsquo;ll be productive people one day and support our families.&rdquo;
