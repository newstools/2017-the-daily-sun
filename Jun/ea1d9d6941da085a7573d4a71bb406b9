THE Yende family is shocked by the news that Thembisile Yende (29) was murdered. Police confirmed that Thembisile&rsquo;s post mortem revealed she had suffered head injuries and bruises on her neck before her death. Her distraught brother Mboneni Yende said the family was deeply disturbed by the news. He said: &ldquo;This proves what we have always said, that Thembi didn&rsquo;t kill herself, but was a murder victim. &ldquo;We thought the information we received about her death would bring closure and satisfaction. &ldquo;Instead we are left questioning who might have wanted Thembi dead.&rdquo;Mboneni said Thembi had always complained about her safety when working alone at the substation.&ldquo;Eskom is a big company. &ldquo;Thembi was not the only one complaining about safety.&ldquo;They should have acted on the matter before, instead of waiting for someone to die.&rdquo;Mboneni said the power supplier should question all employees, including security guards. &ldquo;They are the ones who should know what happened to Thembi.&ldquo;Do they really care about their employees?&rsquo; Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the case is still under investigation. &ldquo;We have changed the case from an inquest to murder, and we are appealing to anyone with information to come forward.&rdquo; Thembi went missing on 17 May after leaving her home in Springs, Ekurhuleni in her company car. She was discovered dead in her locked office after Eskom employees got a whiff of a strong smell coming from the corridors of the substation where she worked. She had been dead for 10 days. She was laid to rest on Saturday at an emotional funeral attended by Eskom board members, including chairman Ben Ngubane and SA Trade Union general secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi.
