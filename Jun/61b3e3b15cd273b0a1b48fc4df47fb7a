We are making a call on these men to change.&rdquo; Ngcobo said there would be another, bigger march on 28 July.KwaMashu hostel resident Thembi Mzulwini (45) said she hoped the initiative was going to help.The event was attended by actor Sifiso Simamane, who plays the role of a cop, Captain Mthimkhulu, in the SABC1 drama, Uzalo.&ldquo;My concern for safety and harmony made me squeeze this event into my busy schedule,&rdquo; said Sifiso.After visiting the hostel, the group went on to KwaNozaza, Maoti, Bridge City, Dube Village and Lindelani.A few weeks ago, KwaMashu shops belonging to foreigners were burnt down!
