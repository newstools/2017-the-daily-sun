IN THE Bible, Jesus Christ warned his followers about false prophets.The cops have reminded South Africans of Jesus&rsquo; words. They are warning people to be careful of two men.The men claim to be prophets but end up stealing from people. The police in Ivory Park, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun their latest victim was a woman from Ebony Park, who was robbed of her car, laptop and other belongings. Police spokesman Captain Bernard Matimulane said the woman told the cops the trouble started when a prophet phoned her and knew everything about her life, which led her to believe the man. The woman said she met the man on Friday and gave him her number. The next day he phoned her. &ldquo;The man said his name was Daniel and when she met him, he was joined by another man who he said was his helper,&rdquo; said Matimulane. &ldquo;The woman was sent to pee in a cold drink can and bring it back to the men, but that was the last time she saw them. While she was gone, they drove off with her car and everything in it.&rdquo; Matimulane said the men were travelling in a green VW Golf with no registration number. The public should be careful of these crooks.&rdquo; He said they operated in Kaalfontein and Ebony Park.
