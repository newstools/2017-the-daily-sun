SIPHO Maja&rsquo;s love of booze has always got him into trouble, but he believes on Tuesday morning it saved his life. The 35-year-old from Angelo squatter camp in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun his shack went up in flames and he would have burned to death if he had not been out buying beer! He said he woke up at around 7am with a terrible hangover after a night of boozing with his friends and decided to go and get two beers to take the edge off. While he was away, his neighbour&rsquo;s shack caught fire and soon his home was also burned to ashes. When Sipho came home, he found his shack and two others burning. He and other community members tried to put out the fire but it was too late. &ldquo;Thank God nobody was in any of the three shacks because it could have been much worse. Residents told me the fire started in my neighbour&rsquo;s shack while he was away at work. Thank God my wife and children were not home,&rdquo; he said. By the time firefighters arrived on the scene, everything had been destroyed. Sipho&rsquo;s family and two neighbouring families were left with nowhere to live. They said they would appreciate any donations. &ldquo;We lost everything, from beds and TVs to clothes and food. I was left with only the clothes I was wearing,&rdquo; said Sipho. William Ntladi, spokesman for disaster and emergency management services in Ekurhuleni, said: &ldquo;We reacted to an emergency call in Angelo squatter camp where three shacks were burned down. &ldquo;There were no injuries or deaths reported and our officials assisted to put out the fire.&rdquo;
