A FAMILY in Hankey, Eastern Cape is living in a mud house because their RDP was allegedly given to someone else. Nkululeko Katwo (45) lives in a six-roomed shack in Centerton, near town. He is unemployed and lives with his two children and his 61-year-old disabled brother, Sandile Katwo.The house has very small windows and the family uses the bucket toilet system.Nkululeko told Daily Sun: &ldquo;My late mother applied for an RDP many years ago. It should have been built here on our stand.&ldquo;All the people in Centerton who had mud houses already have their houses from government, except us. I was born in this mud house and know how hard it is to live here.&rdquo;He said his mother died last month, disappointed that she never saw her RDP.&ldquo;My daughter checked and was shocked to find that our house was given to someone in Rosedale. The Kouga Municipality should do the right thing by giving that house to us, or should build a new one here.&ldquo;I live with my disabled brother who struggles to move around the mud house. It&rsquo;s dark inside and leaks when there&rsquo;s rain because it was built many years ago.&rdquo; Councillor Desmond Petersen from the municipality&rsquo;s infrastructure committee said: &ldquo;Senior staff at the housing section are unaware of the matter. They will contact Nkululeko and then investigate the family&rsquo;s claim.&rdquo;
