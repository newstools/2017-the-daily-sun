I have decided to stay indoors during the day. I wait until it’s dark outside before I even go to the toilet.” Nobuhle said the situation left her feeling depressed and as if the world hates her. She said she tried jogging early in the morning to fight the fat but it just made things worse. “If I try to go to the gym or jog it just gets worse. “No gym can prosper against my fat.“I don’t know what to do any more.” Nobuhle said she started putting on weight when she was about 15. “It’s a pity I don’t have pictures of my body beforehand. Our shack burned down years ago and we lost everything.” Nobuhle said she tried to eat healthily but it didn’t help either. She also tried starving herself. Her father Mpiyaphi Myeza (49) said: “I’m worried about my daughter. I just hope she finds help. Her life is stuck.”Joburg dietician Ellen Williams said Nobuhle needs professional help. “Dieticians use nutritional research to help individuals or groups make healthy food choices suitable for them,” Williams said.
