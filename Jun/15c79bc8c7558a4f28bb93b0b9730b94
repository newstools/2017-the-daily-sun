THE little baby girl slept between her mum and dad, safe and warm, but death&rsquo;s cold grip was waiting next to the bed.When the mum woke up last Thursday morning, her baby wasn&rsquo;t in bed next to her.To her horror, she found her eight-month-old girl head down and dead in the family&rsquo;s pee bucket! The tragedy happened in Alexandra, northern Joburg.The heartbroken mum of three, Mary Dladla (28), said: &ldquo;This tragedy haunts me every day. I can barely sleep or eat. How Sphesihle fell into the bucket is still a mystery to me. I didn&rsquo;t hear single cry from her. &ldquo;I believe she might have moved during her sleep and fallen into the 20 litre bucket. She sleeps with me and her dad every night.&rdquo;She said the bucket stood at the side of the bed.Mary woke up and found the head of her baby in the bucket and the baby&rsquo;s clothes wet.&ldquo;I am torn apart. I believe that my daughter&rsquo;s spirit was abducted and will not find peace until it rests.&rdquo; Mary said that she loved her daughter and was still trying to come to terms with the loss.&ldquo;A mother should not bury her children. No parent should go through this horrific experience. &ldquo;I feel so empty and hopeless. Life&rsquo;s unfair. She was a gentle, sweet soul.&rdquo;
