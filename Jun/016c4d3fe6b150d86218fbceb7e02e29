COPS have warned the public to stop posting fake messages on social media or face the law.Cops spokeswoman Major-General Sally de Beer said this caused panic in communities and wasted resources.&ldquo;Social media is a helpful medium for both the community and the police,&rdquo; said De Beer. &ldquo;We have noted with concern the increasing number of false posts on social media about missing, kidnapped and abducted girls and women.&rdquo;She said earlier this week that a social media post which alleged the abduction of a girl in Naledi, Soweto, by people in a Quantum taxi went viral. After investigation, the owner of the vehicle was traced and could prove that the vehicle had been parked over the period of the alleged incident. &ldquo;When the person who wrote the post was traced, she could not substantiate her story,&rdquo; said De Beer.De Beer also spoke about the violence that erupted in KwaMashu, KZN, on Monday night after false reports spread on social media that kids were kidnapped for the sale of their body parts.&ldquo;Shops belonging to foreigners were looted. This is an example of how the reckless use of social media can cause chaos and even loss of lives.&rdquo;
