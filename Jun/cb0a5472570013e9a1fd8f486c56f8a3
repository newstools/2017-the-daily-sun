RESIDENTS of Bonella, near Mayville in Durban, have started rebuilding their shacks after spending a week squatting with friends in nearby informal settlements. This is because 36 shacks were allegedly burnt by eThekwini municipality security guards a week ago.This happened after the residents illegally invaded municipal land last month claiming they had been waiting too long for the municipality to give them land to build houses.An angry resident said: &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t stop fighting for decent housing. They must stop fighting us and give us land to build houses.&rdquo; Another resident, Nokuthula Xulu (45), said they had children who needed shelter.&ldquo;When they burnt down our shacks they left us with nothing but the clothes we are wearing. &ldquo;We have to start everything from scratch so that our children can go back to school.&rdquo; Abahlali Basemjondolo chairman Thulani Zondi said they will continue to fight for better lives.&ldquo;If we have to die fighting for shelter over our heads we will.&ldquo;They can arrest us if they like but the struggle will continue. If they want us to leave here they must give us a place to go.&ldquo;This place is unoccupied and there is no reason to chase us out,&rdquo; said Zondi.He added that these residents have no homes and can&rsquo;t afford to move to expensive suburbs because most are not working.&ldquo;Shacks are the only thing they can afford to build because they get the material for free from dumpsites,&rdquo; said Zondi.Mthunzi Gumede, spokesman for the eThekwini mayor, said they will check with the mayor&rsquo;s office to see if they have met with residents in the area.&ldquo;The mayor condemns the residents&rsquo; actions in continuing to build their shacks on municipal land. &ldquo;They must wait for the mayor&rsquo;s representative to come and address them,&rdquo; said Gumede.
