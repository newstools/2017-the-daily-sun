ON SATURDAY, Metro FM DJ and Shiz Niz producer Rashid Kay was hijacked. The DJ, whose real name is Mduduzi Khumalo, was visiting his parents in Moffat View, Joburg. &ldquo;I drove in and was about to close the gate when I saw another car stopping at the gate. &ldquo;I thought my parents had visitors so I left the gate open and went back to my car to make space for them.&rdquo; Rashid said he then saw two men pointing guns at him. &ldquo;One told me to lie down. They hit me with a gun and put me in the back seat. &ldquo;While one tormented me, the other guy drove my VW GTI. &ldquo;Every time I tried to look them in the face or move, they would beat me. &ldquo;They asked for my bank pin and we stopped at a garage to withdraw cash.&ldquo;They changed cars and while they were putting me into the new car, I heard them talking about Tembisa. &ldquo;I think that was where we were. &ldquo;They kept me for four hours and beat me. They then took my clothes, including my underwear, and left me naked in the bush in South Hills.&rdquo; Rashid went to the nearest house and asked to use the phone. &ldquo;I called my business partner, Osmic Menoe, and he came to pick me up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried they might still be withdrawing from my account because I can&rsquo;t access it. The bank said they could only help me if I had my ID.&rdquo; Constable Mekateko Bila confirmed a hijacking case has been opened. &ldquo;The task team is investigating the case.&rdquo;
