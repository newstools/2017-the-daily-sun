RESIDENTS of Bonela in Mayville, Durban have vowed not to leave municipal land they have invaded.The residents claim to have been shot at with rubber bullets while their 36 shacks, built three weeks ago, were allegedly set alight by security guards sent by eThekwini Municipality on Saturday. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost everything in the fire and now have nowhere to go,&rdquo; said one resident.After their shacks were allegedly set on fire, the residents took to the streets and blocked roads with burning tyres and trees. They were demanding to be allowed to rebuild on the land.Resident Thulani Zondi (43) said they decided to invade the land after the municipality ignored their pleas for land to build houses. &ldquo;We were renting one of the municipality&rsquo;s transit camps in Mayville but the owners kicked us out in January. &ldquo;We wrote a letter to the municipality asking to be assisted with land but we never got a response so we decided to invade this land,&rdquo; said Thulani.He said they had nowhere to go. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where to go, and that is why we are still here despite having lost everything.&rdquo; Another resident, Nompumelelo Mdiyati (38), said she lost her ID, child&rsquo;s birth certificate and her Sassa grant card.&ldquo;I wanted shelter after I was kicked out of the place I was renting for R700. But now I have lost everything.&rdquo; KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said no case had been opened.The eThekwini mayor&rsquo;s spokesman, Mthunzi Gumede, urged residents to stop invading land that belongs to the municipality as they are disrupting development plans.&ldquo;We have not heard about the incident but we will follow it up and get more facts,&rdquo; said Gumede.
