LIVESTOCK farmers in Malamulele, Limpopo are puzzled by their missing cattle.This comes after months of cattle theft have left many owners without an income as they depend on their livestock to survive.It is believed that livestock thieves round up the animals in the veld and herd them to neighbouring villages where they are slaughtered.The meat is allegedly then sold to catering companies, butcheries and shisa nyama owners. Between 12 and 20 cows are stolen almost every week. The affected livestock farmers are from Matiyani and Josefa villages.Heartbroken victim Jonas Maluleke (56) said: &ldquo;I went to look for my 12 cattle on Saturday. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes when I stumbled onto my animals&rsquo; ring bells dumped under a tree. There was no sign of them.&rdquo; Asked if he reported it to the police, he said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of reporting? Nothing will ever return to me.&rdquo; Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said they hadn&rsquo;t received reports of stock theft.Godfrey Yingwani (39) chisa nyama&rsquo;s owner in Makulekeke village said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true that we buy stolen meat from the criminals. Because once your customers know that you sell them stolen meat, they will stop buying from you. We will also get arrested as well. So the allegation are not true at all.&rdquo;
