YOUTH day celebrations were held across Mzansi on Friday to remember the sacrifices made by the students of June 16, 1976. President Jacob Zuma’s Youth Day speech in Tshing near Ventersdorp, North West, for a moment seemed to go in the same direction as his Worker’s Day address. This was after some youths came out chanting, “Zuma must go!”if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjst9OMatjJXG_SlfYrgTxBofad52o9B-R7knFkMPmiXo4NULXvId43awDbxAwfkmjlfGoboKmL8CoVIIubMulTiU4V8I-Rml2heoI84kmXSSUdXw-L9P1IqKJhAT8nypFCd7ff3HQ1LGJ6NQ40PCmANBphOUjeEDg5-YX5BwFGbaLKqw_m_V9pCdQsHFOCPF_2I8fI9xydfkkrCWZw_9-S3kfIgxWUb3LQjCyc2wTi85VnwHiGfQcNdQAhQIBnBF4TGqlTkNFA12d0BfCiaRJRoLnAVlVus\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBUGIzGPZFTEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Moleko Mojahi from Boikhutso Village said: “It’s useless for Zuma to be here because he is useless himself. “Billions of rands went to the Guptas through their crooked contracts. “That money should have been used for services.”But this time organisers bused in pupils to fill up the marquee, with only accredited people allowed inside, apparently to prevent further embarrassments.In Soweto, the historic Vilakazi Street was abuzz with excitement, good food and local art. Celebrities, tourists and residents remembered the day with different activities. In Orlando East, community leader Seth Mazibuko, the youngest member of the Soweto uprising’s Student Action Committee, expressed his disappointment with the ANC government, especially the allegations of state capture against the Guptas. In KZN, Zuma’s wife Thobeka Madiba-Zuma called on all South Africans to fight women and child abuse. She urged the youth to empower themselves through government’s entrepreneur programmes that are aimed at creating employment.The DA leader in Limpopo, Jacques Smalle, lashed out at government when he spoke to residents of Mentz Village outside Polokwane. Smalle said the government had a poor education system, and that it was failing today’s youth. The provincial government commemorated the day at the Chuene Resort, in partnership with the National Youth Development Agency. The event started with a 5km walk resembling the 1976 peaceful protest march.
