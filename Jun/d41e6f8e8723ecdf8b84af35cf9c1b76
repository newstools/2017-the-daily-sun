PASTORS, church leaders and community members came together in prayer on Sunday to ask God to stop violence against women and children. The prayers in Alexandra, northern Joburg, were led by Prophet Mthobeli Ndleleni of Will of God Ministries International and Apostle Ndou. The two said they organised the prayer session because they were very concerned about the ongoing killing of innocent women and kids. Prophet Ndleleni said: &ldquo;We asked women from churches in the community to ask God to protect them, their children and families. &ldquo;Our aim is to make it clear that violence in our community is not allowed and to ask God to change people&rsquo;s minds so they go to church.&rdquo; He said the devil was in South Africa and it was a country under siege. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re facing a devil in this country. We don&rsquo;t know where this culture comes from. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know who these people are who are abducting our children. We need to pray,&rdquo; said Ndleleni. He urged men and women to stand together to fight the senseless killing of innocent people. He also thanked leaders of various congregations for attending the event and encouraged them to continue praying for an end to violence. Ndleleni said the government alone couldn&rsquo;t win the fight against gender-based violence and asked community members to help the police fight crime.He encouraged church members who attended the event to report violence against women and children to the police. Ndleleni also told people to open up to their church leaders if they were experiencing violence. &ldquo;There is no room for abusers in our community. Churches are urged to work with community members and the police to stop people from abusing their partners and children.&rdquo;
