PASTOR Enoch Phiri, founder of Restoration Ministries, has decided to withdraw his programme from TBN Africa, on DStv. Phiri told Daily Sun it was a difficult decision for him to withdraw his programme.He said the decision came at a time when South Africans are talking about the issue of land restitution, which he had been addressing on his programme.He claimed TBN Africa had in the past attempted to censor him by suspending scheduled programmes because his views on land, and how it ought to be given to black people, were said to be offending white viewers.&ldquo;There is no freedom without land. &ldquo;The land issue is an unfinished issue for democratic South Africa.&rdquo; The pastor said he believed in a free press, its independence and the right to broadcast content that fitted with viewers&rsquo; tastes.He said he fully understood the relationship between the media and advertising but said he hoped TBN Africa would come to its senses and not give in to pressure.&ldquo;I believe TBN Africa management has the capacity to realise that trying to dictate the narrative on their platform will only add fuel to the fire, rather than helping South Africans.&rdquo; Lucky Mbiko, managing director of TBN in Africa, said he was not aware that the pastor had withdrawn his programme.Mbiko said as far as he knew, the pastor was still on air.
