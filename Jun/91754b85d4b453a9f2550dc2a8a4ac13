The municipality is also aware, but nothing has been done to resolve the matter. Our street is like a river.&rdquo;When the SunTeam visited the kasi earlier this week, residents were struggling to get out of their homes because of the flood.Milani Thiso (54), said: &ldquo;The ambulance and the rubbish collectors don&rsquo;t come to the area because of the mess.&ldquo;I make sure that my kids stay indoors because I don&rsquo;t want them to get sick.&rdquo;Shop owner Andile Majovu (47) said the mess was affecting his business.&ldquo;Customers don&rsquo;t come to the shop. I can&rsquo;t even park my car outside. We reported the matter to the municipality but nothing has been done.&rdquo;Councillor Simthembile Mfecane said: &ldquo;I was with a city official named Kenneth Cupico. He said the city would resolve the matter. When city officials visit our areas, they should come to us first because now they are saying there is no flooding, when we know there is.&rdquo;The disappointed councillor said he would visit the street again and talk to the municipality.
