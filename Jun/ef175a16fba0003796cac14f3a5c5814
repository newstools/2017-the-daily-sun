DAVID Bogaseng (30) of Naledi, Soweto had been getting a disability grant for two years &ndash; until last month. That&rsquo;s when he claims Sassa officials demanded bribes to continue his grant! He refused and his grant has been stopped.David was born with spinal stenosis and the disorder may lead to permanent disability. The spinal cord affects nearly every physical function, making it virtually impossible for sufferers to do any physical work. Speaking to Daily Sun, David said: &ldquo;I was told even though doctors said I qualified to receive grant money, the Sassa officials needed to conduct their own tests to verify if I still qualify to be a Sassa beneficiary.&rdquo;David received the shocking news when he went to the Sassa offices at De Villiers Street in the Joburg CBD last month. He said he was told by one of the officials that he needed to give them R1 000 to ensure his grant would continue.&ldquo;When I refused to give them the money they told me I would no longer receive a grant.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m eligible to work and don&rsquo;t qualify for the grant. &ldquo;If they say I qualify for work, why don&rsquo;t they help me get a job? I use the grant money to feed myself and pay rent. How am I expected to continue sustaining myself?&rdquo;Daily Sun contacted Nandi Mosi, Sassa&rsquo;s Gauteng spokeswoman, who said: &ldquo;Sometimes doctors give people false hope and tell them they qualify for grant money even though they don&rsquo;t &ndash; so as Sassa we have to conduct our own investigation.&ldquo;With regard to our officials demanding a bribe, we&rsquo;ll investigate that.&rdquo;
