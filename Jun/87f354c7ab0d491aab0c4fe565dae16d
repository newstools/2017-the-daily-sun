RUMOURED millionaire Prince Mazibuko appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on Tuesday, to answer charges of fraud.&nbsp;But he walked out of court when the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.&nbsp;Forex dealers known to Sunday Sun alleged that the trader was charged with defrauding Mimi Mahlangu of an amount estimated at R400&thinsp;000.&nbsp;When contacted, Mimi told the SunTeam: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true. Prince defrauded me and I opened a case against him at Sandton Police Station.&nbsp;&ldquo;We had a contractual agreement. He was supposed to invest my money and pay me back. But he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp;The colourful forex trader is now facing further legal troubles, according to Sunday Sun sources.&nbsp;They claim Prince will soon return to the Randburg Magistrates Court to face fraud charges brought by his ex-partner Maudi Lentsoane.&nbsp;According to a second source in the forex industry, Prince&rsquo;s world is &ldquo;falling apart&rdquo; because of a vicious quarrel with Maudi.&nbsp;When asked to comment, Prince said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, but I can&rsquo;t say anymore on this matter since it&rsquo;s now in court.&rdquo;&nbsp;The source alleged: &ldquo;Prince owes Maudi R80&thinsp;000. To think, these guys used to be very close &ndash; they were inseparable.&nbsp;&ldquo;Maudi was, at one point, bankrolling Prince&rsquo;s lifestyle. And that was because his forex company wasn&rsquo;t doing well at the time.&rdquo;&nbsp;The source went on to claim: &ldquo;Maudi even hired a white VW Golf 7 R for Prince to drive.&rdquo;&nbsp;According to the source, it was sad that clients had invested their savings in the world of forex.&nbsp;This insider claimed: &ldquo;The poor investors are caught up in the drama of the beef between the former friends.&nbsp;&ldquo;Prince and Maudi are trying to bring each other down.&rdquo;&nbsp;But Maudi denied having beef with Prince or bankrolling him.&nbsp;When asked to comment, Maudi said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no dispute between him and me. We&rsquo;re fine.&rdquo;&nbsp;But this statement doesn&rsquo;t match Maudi&rsquo;s words in a certain sound recording.&nbsp;The SunTeam is in possession of this recording in which Maudi&rsquo;s voice is clearly heard, as he threatens to destroy Prince if he doesn&rsquo;t get his money back.&nbsp;Prince said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t comment on this matter at the moment, will talk when it&rsquo;s the right time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
