IT ALL started a month ago when a water pipe in the street burst.Soon Thembalethu Gwili&rsquo;s house became a swamp . . . And when it didn&rsquo;t stop, his wife and daughter (16) left, saying they were not prepared to live like frogs!But Thembalethu (46) from Khayamnandi in Despatch, Nelson Mandela Bay, decided to stay.&ldquo;My wife and daughter are gone. They said they couldn&rsquo;t live like frogs and I should leave too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They left a month ago after the water started seeping into our house, but I still live like a frog!&rdquo; Each time he woke up, he would find water dammed up in all the rooms. He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I have two reference numbers and I have reported the matter to our ward councillor. &ldquo;His office keeps phoning the municipal toll-free number, but no one has come to my aid. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living in this house happily since 1994, but now being here is hell. Nobody can live like this.&ldquo;When water is leaking in town, where mlungus live, municipal workers spring into action. &ldquo;But in kasis, it has become the norm that we have to live like pigs and frogs.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Water services promised to follow up on the matter.&ldquo;They also promised to contact the affected person.&rdquo;
