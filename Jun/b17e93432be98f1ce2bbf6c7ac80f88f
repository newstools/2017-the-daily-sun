WHEN Agnes Mashilo heard the shack her son used for his salon and TV repair business was being demolished, she rushed to the scene. But little did she know that soon her eyes would be burning with pepper spray! The 56-year-old mum from phase 5 in Mamelodi East, Tshwane told Daily Sun she and her son, Sello (28), rushed to the shack belonging to her other son, Happy (42), last Wednesday and found men breaking it down and throwing TVs outside. The shack was located next to a surgery. &ldquo;We asked the men why they were breaking down my son&rsquo;s shack and they told us the doctor had instructed them to do so,&rdquo; she said. Agnes said the men left but minutes later, the doctor arrived with a gun and a can of pepper spray. &ldquo;I tried to talk to him but he sprayed Sello in the face. He fell down and the doctor came towards me,&rdquo; she claimed. &ldquo;I fought with him. I overpowered him and he fell to the ground but he sprayed me in the face until I couldn&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo; Agnes said she was helped by passersby who washed her and Sello&rsquo;s eyes out with water. Happy said when he tried to open a case at Mamelodi East Police Station he was turned away. &ldquo;They told me they couldn&rsquo;t do anything because my mum assaulted the doctor.&rdquo; Station commander Brigadier Samuel Maredi said he would investigate why Happy was turned away.
