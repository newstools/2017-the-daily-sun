CHIPPA United captain Thamsanqa Sangweni is a wanted man! It is understood that Kaizer Chiefs are back in the race to sign the midfielder.&nbsp;His agent, Ali Tlhoaele, said however there were more than one team who had made enquiries. He has since referred those clubs to Chippa United.&nbsp;Said Tlhoaele: &ldquo;I can confirm that I had big five teams in South African football calling me, enquiring about Thami. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t name those teams""I told them to talk to his club because the player still has a contract with them.&nbsp;&ldquo;I heard that other teams are also calling the player. We need to respect that the player is under contract with Chippa and anyone interested must talk to them.&rdquo;However, according to the source close to Sangweni, Chiefs are the club that has shown the most interest and the player is happy with what Amakhosi are offering.&ldquo;Chiefs are long time admirers of Sangweni. But this time they really are looking serious. And the player likes what they&rsquo;re offering.&ldquo;The problem right now is that he is still contracted to Chippa."We all know that Chiefs are not a club that like to spend when it comes to buying players, but maybe they will this time,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp;Amakhosi have been on this road before, chasing Sangweni&rsquo;s signature. During the last off season they, together with their Soweto neighbours Orlando Pirates were keen to sign him, but Chippa were not prepared to let go of their prized asset.&nbsp;In December last year Sangweni signed a three-year contract extension with the Chili Boys.&nbsp;Tlhoaele confirmed: &ldquo;At first we were reluctant to extend but Chippa put an offer that the player couldn&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;Tlhoaele, who is a CEO of KNSport Management and Marketing, also confirmed that he was negotiating with Platinum Stars regarding contract extensions of goalkeeper Mbongeni Mzimela and defender Siboniso &ldquo;Jomo&rdquo; Gumede. He also added that Baroka FC coach Milton Dlamini was wanted by other clubs in the Absa Premiership as an assistant.
