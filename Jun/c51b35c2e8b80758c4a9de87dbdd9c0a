ORLANDO PIRATES goalie, Siyabonga Mpontshane, is allegedly not getting any joy &ndash; on or off the field.&nbsp;The player is rumoured to be frustrated due to lack of game time.&nbsp;Now news that his wife, Makhweshube Mpontshane, is allegedly hooking up with an old flame is said to be causing extra stress.&nbsp;According to sources, Makhweshube has found love in the arms of her old lover, Nhlanhla Cele, a famous inyanga in Umlazi, south of Durban in KwaZulu-Natal.&nbsp;A source said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a known fact that they find time to see each other, despite the fact that they&rsquo;re both married.&nbsp;&ldquo;This causes problems between Makhweshube and&nbsp;Siyabonga, as they fight over this a lot.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Makhweshube finds it hard to forget about Nhlanhla. I think he used a spell on her,&rdquo; said the second source. When the SunTeam called Makhweshube for comment, a woman, Thembisa who said she&rsquo;s Makhweshube&rsquo;s sister, answered and said: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here at the moment, but I can tell you, if she wants to go back to Nhlanhla, we&rsquo;ll fully support her.&rdquo;&nbsp;Nhlanhla, who has six wives, said: &ldquo;If she wants to come back, I won&rsquo;t refuse, as we had a beautiful thing a few years ago. She sends me sweet messages that any man would smile from mouth to ear if he were to receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Nhlanhla revealed that Makhweshube could be driven by a spell he put on her.&nbsp;&ldquo;Siyabonga should bring his wife to me and I&rsquo;ll cast the spell out of her. He&rsquo;ll have to leave her here and go home, so I can take it out the same way I put it in while we were still together,&rdquo; Nhlanhla said.&nbsp;Makhweshube said: &ldquo;I &lsquo;m having a love affair with Cele. I love him so much that I don&rsquo;t give a damn about his six wives. When asked about her marriage to Siyabonga, she said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want say anything about that.&rdquo;Siyabonga said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever entertain those people because what they are telling you is all lies. I think this inyanga is trying to gain popularity using my name,&rdquo; he said.
