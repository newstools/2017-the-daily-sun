SOCIAL media has exploded with disgust following a video showing a taxi door operator assaulting three schoolkids. People in the background can be heard laughing and doing nothing to stop him! It isn&rsquo;t yet clear what led to it, or where in Mzansi it happened, but the video clearly shows the man kicking the girls. Seconds after the fight has cooled down, the driver closes the taxi door. The pupils are then left stranded without help. Social media was abuzz with people condemning the doorkeeper. - &thinsp;Itumeleng Mohlala wrote: &ldquo;What disturbs me most is the laughter.&rdquo; - &thinsp;Aisha Mohamed asked: &ldquo;How can a grown man abuse young girls like this? Who are the hyenas laughing in the background?&rdquo; - &thinsp;Daleen Bester: &ldquo;There is no reason for that type of violence, even if both parties were wrong.
