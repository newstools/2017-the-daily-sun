THE Windy City will become the centre of attention tomorrow as over 15&thinsp;000 athletes are set to try their luck at this year&rsquo;s Athletics SA 21,1km (half marathon) championships in Port Elizabeth.There has been complaints about the harsh winds in the city in the past, which often make it impossible for athletes to reach their full potential, as they are literally competing against Mother Nature&rsquo;s raw power too!But that is the beauty of road running in Port Elizabeth &ndash; and makes it crystal clear why the city is also known as the Windy City.Last year&rsquo;s winners from Kenya &ndash; Edwin Koech and Sheila Chesang &ndash; have both confirmed their participation in this year&rsquo;s event and are eager to defend their titles. The 30-year-old Koech stopped the clock at 1:01:16 last year to set a new men&rsquo;s course record for the race, while Chesang shattered the women&rsquo;s record, setting a blistering time of 1:10:58.Koech&rsquo;s personal best in a half marathon is an amazing 59:54, set in Sarnen, Switzerland, in 2015.There will be no hiding for South Africa&rsquo;s top athletes, who will be eager to leave the Kenyans eating dust and ensure they reach the finish line first to take ownership of the race again.&nbsp; Among the SA athletes confirmed for the race are the 2013 Two Oceans Marathon champion from Tshwane Stephen Mokoka and Lucky Mohale. Mohale returns in an attempt to reclaim the crown he won in 2015 before being dethroned last year.Athletics SA also confirmed that 2014 winner Elroy Gelant of Central North West will be back to compete for top honours.The first male and female runners home will pocket R50&thinsp;000 each, while there is an R8&thinsp;000 bonus for Elite Performance Athletes.Race director Mike Mbambani says 15 of the top 20 men&rsquo;s finishers from last year and 15 of the top 20 women finishers have been entered for the race by their provinces.Said Mbambani: &ldquo;Top women athletes include 2015 runner-up Lebogang Phalula and 2014 winner, Mapaseka Makhanya (both Central Gauteng).&rdquo;Another race favourite, Irvette van Zyl, had to pull out, however, due to an injury she sustained in a race in Durban, said Gauteng North team manager Wynand Breytenbach.&nbsp;&ldquo;The race is well organised and the route is fantastic. It is flat and fast, and ideal for spectators due to its easy access and two laps to view,&rdquo; he said in a statement.Tracey McKay, team manager for Central Gauteng, said: &rdquo;We are fielding a very strong team this year. Gladwin Mzazi is running well and Derocious Makhublao ran an excellent race in Gaborone recently.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our female runners, Lebogang Phalula, Cornelia Joubert and Christine Kalmer, are looking forward to a fast race on a superb course.&ldquo;Our runners are very excited about the opportunity to win a car too,&rdquo; McKay added.Martin Ngwenya, running co-ordinator for Mr Price Sport, confirmed that he would be bringing four elite athletes from Lesotho: &ldquo;We have entered two female contenders &ndash; Lineo Chaka, who finished 12th in the Two Oceans half marathon, and Neheng Khatala, who finished third in the JG Zuma half marathon &ndash; and two male contenders, Khoaraholane Seutloali (second in the Two Oceans half marathon) and Mothimokholo Hatasi (second in the JG Zuma half marathon).&rdquo;
