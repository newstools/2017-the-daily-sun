SCORES of women and children across Mzansi suffer extreme poverty. Nonkosi Masondo (33) and her son, Sandile (11) are living proof of this. The single, unemployed mum and her son live in a shack filled with dirty water, which could collapse at any time and the boy has never set foot in a school. The pair from Kliptown squatter camp in Joburg have absolutely no form of income and no hope for the future.Nonkosi told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I live like an animal but there&rsquo;s not much I can do about my situation. My family has abandoned me. &ldquo;My mum kicked me out of her house and said she wanted nothing to do with me. I was left stranded with nowhere to go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been living here for the past three years. I live on hand-outs and sometimes I go from shop to shop begging for any form of help. Things get so bad at times that we go for weeks without food. &ldquo;My son and I don&rsquo;t even have birth certificates and because of this I&rsquo;ve never been able to send him to school.&rdquo; Mbangwa Xaba, social development department spokesman, said: &ldquo;Women and children must be protected at all times. We thank Daily Sun for bringing this alarming matter to us. It&rsquo;s very unfortunate that Nonkosi and her son live in such terrible conditions. We will send social workers to evaluate the situation.&rdquo;
