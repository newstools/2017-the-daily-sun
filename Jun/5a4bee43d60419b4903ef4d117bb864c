THE LION KING producer Lebohang Morake’s woes are growing by the day. Sunday Sun can reveal that Lebo M has filed for bankruptcy in the US. The SunTeam has also learnt that while pleading poverty, Lebo has allegedly lost his wife Angela – for the second time. This hardly six months after tying the knot with her in a repeat marriage. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Lebo made headlines recently when he went back to Angela after he dumping his baby mama, Robert Marawa’s ex, Zoe Mthiyane. Sources claim Lebo owes a lot of people. Said the source: “He has no money to pay them.” According to a document seen by the SunTeam, Lebo filed for bankruptcy on 12 June. Court papers state that whoever was owed by Lebo should come forward before the deadline. The source alleged this is Lebo’s second attempt at filing. “The first application was denied by the court.” Lebo’s business partner said the bankruptcy filing was “nonsense”. “His pocket is still deep. Lebo’s running away from financial woes. He claims he owes people. This court move is one of his many stunts,” said the source, adding that Lebo was avoiding his baby mama dramas as he owes them. A third source said Lebo was in Germany on a world tour with a new girlfriend. Meanwhile, Angela was nursing a broken heart at home. This source claims Lebo described Angela as a gold-digger, who was only after his money, and that Lebo was hiding his wealth. The source further alleges Lebo is also embroiled in a court battle with his ex-wife, Nandi. “I’m not sure what’s happening there, but I know they’ve been in court for months now and Lebo’s been bitter about it,” said the source. When asked for comment, Angela confirmed Lebo had ended their wedding of six months without her knowledge, citing that she was schizophrenic. “How do you know? You journalists! Yes, we’re no longer married,” she added. Asked about Lebo’s bankruptcy case, she said: “Yes, I know that too,” and hung up the phone. Nandi refused to comment, saying it was a court matter. Lebo was not available for comment this week. Lebo’s manager, Neo Motlhala, said: “He won’t be able to comment as he’s currently touring Europe and there might be time difference issues.”
