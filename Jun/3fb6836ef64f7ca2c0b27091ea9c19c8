MARITZBURG UNITED chairperson, Farook Kadodia, has confirmed that the deal between the Team of Choice and Mamelodi Sandowns on Deolin Mekoa has fell through.The midfielder was linked with a move to Tshwane next season in a deal that would have seen United receiving cash plus two players from the African Champions.Yesterday, Kadodia confirmed to SunSport that the deal was off and said he was saddened by this.&ldquo;This is not fair on the player. He was so excited about the move. Everything looked all set to go and suddenly Sundowns backed down on the deal.&ldquo;Now, I can confirm that the deal is off and Deolin will be staying at the club.&rdquo;Kadodia said this would do more harm to the 23-year-old who was tipped as the replacement for Keagan Dolly, who left Sundowns for French club Montpellier in January.&nbsp;Said Kadodia: &ldquo;The reason they gave us in their statement is that the player doesn&rsquo;t fit in their plans. We are really disappointed about this. They&rsquo;ve done damage to the player. It is really sad.&rdquo;Kadodia has done deals with Sundowns before when sold United Zimbabwean striker Cuthbert Malajila, defender Kwanda Mngonyama and midfielder Musa Nyatama. Even though Kadodia was quoted on Kickoff&nbsp;website in April saying he didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;think Mekoa was ready for such a big&nbsp;move yet, he was actually willing let&nbsp;him go. In that article he said the Durban-born was not a complete article yet but he hoped Sundowns would do what they did when they bought Mngonyama and Nyatama.Sundowns bought these players only to loan them back to the Team of Choice the following season.The chairperson also touched on their search for a permanent head coach. United finished the 2016/17 campaign with Fadlu Davids in charge on an interim basis after the resignation of Roger De Sa in March.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;At the moment, we would like to keep it a secret. We&rsquo;ll reveal everything before we open for preseason on 28 June.&ldquo;By then, the coach will be available to start the new season&rsquo;s preparations with the players.&rdquo;
