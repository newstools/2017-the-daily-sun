Dear MizzB I am the mum of a beautiful 14-year-old daughter. I want to know how I can raise her so that she doesn&rsquo;t end up in an abusive relationship, or risk losing her life at the hands of her partner. - Warrior Mum Dear Warrior MumRaising a girl child in this day and age is a challenge. It&rsquo;s important to teach your daughter self-confidence and model the type of behaviour that allows her to understand her value as a woman. When a young woman understands who she is and where she is going in life, she will become a force to be reckoned with.Let us empower young girls to achieve their own wealth and not to expect their partners to provide for them. As a parent, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to teach your child to take pride in her life. This will help her to respect other people as well. Teach her how to love herself by accepting who she is and taking pride in whatever she does.
