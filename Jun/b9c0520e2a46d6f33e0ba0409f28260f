THESE pensioners had an awful weekend. Their grant paypoint was robbed on Friday. Police spokeswoman Constable Zanele Mtshweni said Fidelity guards had just delivered money to the paypoint in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane when two armed thugs pounced.&ldquo;One of the employees said she was already inside the &shy;office when she heard people screaming outside. She rushed out and saw thugs with guns, who instructed her to lie down,&rdquo; said Mtshweni. &ldquo;They made their way into the office and used an explosive to gain access to the money.&rdquo; She said the thugs took an undisclosed amount of money and fled the scene. No one was injured during the incident and the suspects are still at large. &ldquo;A case of business robbery was opened and investigations are underway,&rdquo; said Mtshweni. When pensioners and other grant recipients arrived at the paypoint, they were shocked to find the building was damaged and there was no money. One of the pensioners, Monic Mmushi (74), said: &ldquo;I woke up very early to come and queue for my money but now I won&rsquo;t be getting anything. This paypoint is the only one near my house.&rdquo; Another pensioner, Joe Ramongale (67), said the thugs must be dealt with. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t enjoy that money because they have hurt a lot of old people. When you hurt an elderly person, nothing in your life will go well,&rdquo; he said. People were forced to go to other pay-points to get their grants.
