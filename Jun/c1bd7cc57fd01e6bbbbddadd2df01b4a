&ldquo;BURNING our hall won&rsquo;t solve problems &ndash; it creates more,&rdquo; said a resident.The Joe Slovo Community Hall in Milnerton was severely damaged during protest action on Monday night.The resident said: &ldquo;Our kids used to go to the hall to play sport or have debates. Now they will do bad things because they have nothing better to do, especially with the schools closing this week.&ldquo;I am not saying people must not protest, but destroying the things that help others is no good.&rdquo;The hall was burnt by squatters in the area whose illegal shacks have been demolished four times. They invaded an old schoolyard and started building shacks three weeks ago.Resident Nokwandisa Zangwa said: &ldquo;The squatters were angry because they lost some belongings when authorities broke down their shacks.&rdquo;Councillor JP Smith , the mayoral committee member for safety and security, said: &ldquo;It is very hard to accept that the hall was burnt down. The facility has just been renovated, after council pleaded for years for funding to do so.&ldquo;The main hall and kitchen were badly damaged by the fire. The storeroom was burnt with all the recreation equipment that was stored inside.&rdquo;Sarel van Deventer from the municipality said: &ldquo;The destruction of one of the best recreation spaces in Cape Town is terrible. Recently the hall was full of happy kids during a Youth Day programme.&rdquo;Police spokesman Lieutenenant-Colonel Andre Traut said two buildings were set alight and vehicles were stoned during the protest.&ldquo;Cops took action to disperse about 500 protesters and maintain law and order. No one was arrested. Public violence is being investigated,&rdquo; said Traut.
