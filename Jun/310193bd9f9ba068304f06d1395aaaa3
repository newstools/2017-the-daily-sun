LERATO CHABANGU was allegedly chased out of a friend&rsquo;s home in Jozi and not allowed to drink booze.&nbsp; The former Downs, Moroka Swallows and Bafana Bafana star is said to have left the Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, house in tears.&nbsp; The people he&rsquo;d been friends with for decades decided not to booze with him because he had no money to contribute.&nbsp; Insiders alleged that the guys were in a group of four when Lerato arrived.&nbsp; Said a source: &ldquo;He arrived to chill with us as usual, since it was a holiday.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were having fun and soon the booze we had bought ran out. We asked the guys to contribute and buy more booze since the day was going to be long.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lerato told the guys he had no money since he wasn&rsquo;t working.&nbsp; &ldquo;They complained that they had been taking care of him for a long time now, so he needed to pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another source said it was bad for Lerato to be rejected by his friends.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was shocked to see his friends turn on him. Amajita used to visit Lerato in his house at Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni.&nbsp; &ldquo;He took care of us and we never left his house on empty stomachs &ndash; and without drinking his booze.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now that he&rsquo;s down and out, amajita decided to treat him like that. It was unfair.&nbsp; &ldquo;They locked the gate on him, and he left in tears because he was hurting,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp; A third friend, who was there at the booze joint, said: &ldquo;I feel sorry for him. He used to buy us lots of booze when he was still a soccer player. I told the guys that what they were doing was unfair, and it should stop.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lerato refused to comment and hung up on the SunTeam.
