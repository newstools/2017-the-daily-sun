YESTERDAY morning these Eastern Cape residents had a rude awakening. Heavily armed police allegedly stormed land invaders&rsquo; homes and seized homemade petrol bombs.The city was to go ahead with planned evictions in Motherwell, NU29, Ramaphosa and Kamvelihle. Residents of Endlovini informal settlement in Wells Estate woke up to the sound of rubber bullets as 12 suspects were arrested. Lazola Makana (33) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We were shocked when heavily armed police came early in the morning. They kicked doors and shouted at everyone while shooting rubber bullets,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have money to pay rent. We were evicted three times from this site since last year and have lost a lot of valuables as a result.&rdquo;Asanda Mpondo (21) said she and her three-year-old son were fast asleep when cops kicked open their door. &ldquo;They came straight to where I was sleeping and shot rubber bullets at me and my son and even pointed a gun at him. He is in shock.&rdquo;The ANC has condemned the DA-led coalition government for the evictions. Regional secretary Themba Xathula said evictions where people have no alternative undermine their constitutional right to housing. Councillor Nqaba Bhanga said: &ldquo;The eviction is the enforcement of a court order to ensure land in Kamvelihle, Ramaphosa, NU29 and Wells Estate is entirely vacant. The government needs to start excavating for the development of RDP houses.&ldquo;Residents whose homes are due to be built on this land have been waiting for over 20 years.&rdquo;Captain Andre Beetge said a special operation was launched at about 3am in Wells Estate. &ldquo;Twelve suspects were arrested for being in possession of fire-starting devices and 30 tyres, 18 petrol bombs and a can of petrol were confiscated. They will face a charge of public violence,&rdquo; he said.
