KWAITO legend Mdu Masilela faces a charge of attempted murder. His wife said when she asked him who was on the phone . . . HE PULLED A GUN ON HER! if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>That allegation is in a statement given by Sarah Masilela at the Sandton Police Station, north of Joburg. She said the incident happened at their Sandton home a fortnight ago. She told police Mdu answered his phone in the couple’s main bedroom, and then rushed outside to continue a conversation with the caller. In her statement, which was seen by the SunTeam on Thursday, she said the artist was enraged when she quizzed him about the call – and the caller. The statement reads, in part: “The complainant alleges that she was telling her husband that she didn’t like what he was doing outside.” She said: “He started to be rude and told me that nobody can control him. “He went to the main bedroom and came with a firearm. He pulled me outside, pointing the firearm at my head. I was screaming for help.” The police statement reads: “Her husband started shooting a firearm in the air and he told her that he could shoot her in her head. “Police arrived at the scene, after he (the husband) had hidden his firearm. But police managed to find it. The suspect was arrested for attempted murder at Sandton Police Station.” Police spokesperson, Lungelo Dlamini, confirmed that a case of attempted murder had been opened. Dlamini said the suspect had appeared in Randburg Magistrates Court, and had been granted bail. The People’s Paper called Mdu, but he refused to comment. The SunTeam failed to get hold of Sarah despite many efforts.
