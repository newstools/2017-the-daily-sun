EASTERN CAPE communities will benefit from the hand over of 27 new high performance cop cars to police clusters in the province.The cars include 13 VW Golf GTIs and nine BMWs. The vehicles were handed over to station commanders at the provincial police headquarters in Zwelitsha on Wednesday.Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said members of the community expect the police to be visible and active, particularly in their hour of need. &ldquo;Sometimes the lack of cars at cop shops is not explained properly by police officers,&rdquo; said Ntshinga. &ldquo;If a vehicle is not available to assist a complainant within a reasonable amount of time, I have instructed that the matter immediately be brought to the attention of the station commander.&ldquo;That way, an alternative arrangement can be made.&rdquo; The 27 new cars will ensure increased police visibility on highways. They will also help cops in their fight against serious crimes such as hijacking and robbery.
