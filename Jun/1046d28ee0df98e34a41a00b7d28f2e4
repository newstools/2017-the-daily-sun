ABSA is under no obligation to pay anything to the South African government said the bank today.This was in reaction to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane's report that she deems a bailout of R1.125bn by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) of Bankorp to have been unlawfully made and that Absa must pay it back. It relates to SARB&rsquo;s assistance to Bankorp between 1985 and 1995. Absa acquired Bankorp in April 1992. "We have not yet received a copy of the report and we are urgently requesting the Public Protector&rsquo;s office to send it to us. Once we have read it we will consider our legal options including seeking a high court review," Absa said in a statement. "Absa met all its obligations in respect of the loan provided by the SA Reserve Bank by October 1995. It is our firm position that there is no obligation to pay anything to the SA government."Mkhwebane said two investigations into the matter established that the financial aid given to Bankorp Limited/ABSA Bank was irregular. She found that in granting the financial aid to Bankorp the SARB failed to comply with the South African Reserve Bank Act. Furthermore, she said the Ministry of Finance had a duty in terms of the act to ensure compliance by SARB, something she claims it failed to do.http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Financial-Services/absa-no-obligation-to-pay-r1125bn-bailout-20170619
