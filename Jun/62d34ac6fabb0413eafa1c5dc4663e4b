AN AMBULANCE crew on their way to help a patient ended up needing assistance themselves.This was after two thugs robbed them at gunpoint in broad daylight.It happened in Browns farm, Philippi on Saturday morning.&ldquo;The two suspects just opened the door and got into the ambulance after the patient,&rdquo; said ambulance driver Ziyanda Matiwane (27). &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even realise we were getting robbed because I thought they had accompanied the patient. But then they pointed a gun at us and demanded money and cellphones. I thought it was my last day on earth. I was terrified. I thank God that I am alive.The thugs fled with cash, a cellphone, driver&rsquo;s licence, lipstick and stationery.&ldquo;They also grabbed a medical aid kit and then left it. The patient was transported in another ambulance.&ldquo;I still cannot believe that anyone could be so cruel as to rob the ambulance crew who were on a rescue mission,&rdquo; said Ziyanda.Resident Zolani Mavula said he felt sorry for the crew.&ldquo;This clearly shows criminals are stupid! They are a bunch of stupid, evil bastards! Who in their right mind can rob an ambulance that is there to save lives? Now the ambulances will take longer to respond to emergencies because of crime.&rdquo;Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut confirmed the incident.&ldquo;The suspects fled with cash and are yet to be arrested. The crew and the patient were fortunately not injured,&rdquo; said Traut.Anyone with information about the incident should call CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
