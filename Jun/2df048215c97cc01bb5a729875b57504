KING of Kwasa Kwasa Malo A Botsheba is disgusted with Limpopo&rsquo;s musical state of affairs.&nbsp;The artist (real name Stephen Sefofa) said the province&rsquo;s artists were being treated like trash.Said Malo A Botsheba: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve joined hands to fight this challenge. It&rsquo;s sad that when we raise our voices, we have to pay dearly and end up being dropped by the Department of Arts and Culture from their festivals.&nbsp;&ldquo;As a big artist who&rsquo;s been around for decades, I can&rsquo;t keep quiet while other artists are being ill-treated.&rdquo;&nbsp;The singer said he found it in bad taste that the province&rsquo;s artists were being sidelined from prominent annual music festivals such as the Marula and Mapungubwe.&nbsp;He said excluding locals from festivals meant to benefit them was like condemning them to poverty.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s their norm of doing business, fact is, it should change because artists from Limpopo are sidelined in other province&rsquo;s festivals,&rdquo; Malo A Botsheba said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Look, we don&rsquo;t want to have to protest. What we simply want is fairness to artists. We have families to take care of, along with other basic needs.&nbsp;&ldquo;How do we do that if we&rsquo;re constantly overlooked? Really now, where should we get money?&rdquo;&nbsp;And as a call to action, the staunch President Jacob Zuma supporter and Mopani District Municipality chairperson encouraged other artists to join the Limpopo Artists Movement body. This was because &ldquo;there is strength in numbers&rdquo;.&nbsp;&ldquo;An injury to one is an injury to all. Joining hands will make it easier for us to overcome this challenge,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Fellow musician Mphoza Mashabela, the provincial chairperson of the Limpopo Artists Movement, said it was painful to see entertainers being robbed of opportunities &ldquo;in their own backyard&rdquo;.&nbsp;Mphoza said: &ldquo;This movement was formed out of anger. Its main purpose was to fight corruption (in the form of kickbacks, among others), open doors for artists and to give a voice to the voiceless.&nbsp;&ldquo;Honestly, we&rsquo;ve been ignored for many years. Being sidelined from festivals and being paid peanuts should stop. Artists deserve to be treated with dignity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
