&ldquo;MOST people don&rsquo;t know that animals can also be abused. They think only humans are being abused.&rdquo;This was said by Kenesias Dambakurima of the Voices for African Wildlife organisation in Strand, Cape Town.For the past 12 months, the 34-year-old has been staging roadshows across the country. He addresses children and highlights the shame of animal cruelty.Dambakurima said he came up with the roadshow after noticing that many pet owners were unknowingly abusing their animals.The organisation recently visited a children&rsquo;s park in Lower Crossroads kasi to teach them about the proper care of dogs. Dambakurima said if you treat animals properly, they will be your best friend.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want people to treat dogs as their security guards. Animals also need love and care as well.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea to have a couple of dogs, but only if you are able to manage and take care of them. &ldquo;In most cases, those who own more than four dogs don&rsquo;t have the means to take care of them.&rdquo;Dambakurima said he wished he could adopt more dogs from owners who are battling to take good care of them but the mission is impossible. &ldquo;The organisation already has too many dogs we care for. Unfortunately we can&rsquo;t take more. &ldquo;All we can do is to teach and encourage people to take good care of their animals.&rdquo;Nkosazana Zakumani, who was at the children&rsquo;s park, said she has a great bond with her dog.&ldquo;I love my dog very much and I feed it and take good care of it.&rdquo;
