THE DA has announced the names of some ministers and government officials with links to the Gupta family. Chief whip John Steenhuisen and spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme yesterday said they planned to lay charges against the ministers and officials and if they were found guilty of crimes, some could go to prison for as long as 20 years. Some of the ministers named at the press conference at parliament in Cape Town were former communications minister Faith Muthambi, Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and Co-operative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen. Public officials included Denel Aerostructures board chairman Dan Mantsha and ambassador to the Netherlands, Bruce Koloane. The DA accused Muthambi of sending confidential information to the Guptas, while Van Rooyen was accused of striking deals with the Guptas during his three days as finance minister. &ldquo;Special advisors to Van Rooyen, Ian Whitley and Mohamed Bobat, sent Treasury documents to Gupta associates such as Eric Wood and Salim Essa,&rdquo; claimed Van Damme. Steenhuisen said leaked Gupta emails indicated the family had easy access to confidential internal memos from the public enterprises department.Van Damme said Mantsha forwarded confidential emails between Denel and the State Security Agency to the Guptas. Speaking about Koloane, who was involved in allowing the family to use the Waterkloof Airforce Base in 2013, Van Damme said he had sent Gupta associate Ashu Chawla operational information about Waterkloof. &ldquo;Muthambi, Brown, Van Rooyen, Whitley, Bobat and Mantsha may have committed offences in terms of sections three and four of the Protection of Information Act,&rdquo; she said.Koloane and others were accused of violating the National Key Points Act. Steenhuisen said the matter would be discussed with other political parties tomorrow.
