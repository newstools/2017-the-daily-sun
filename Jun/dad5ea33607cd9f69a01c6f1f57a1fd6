PARENTS of pupils at Langalibomvu High School in KwaSokhulu, near Empangeni, north of KZN want a new teacher for life sciences and physical science when the schools open next term. They said the KZN Department of Education must use the school holidays to find a replacement for the teacher who left the school without any explanation in April. Thembisile Ntshangase (54) told Daily Sun that her daughter, who is in grade 12, told her that for the whole of the second term they have been studying these subjects on their own.&ldquo;She said she can&rsquo;t get good results for the two papers. &ldquo;This is worrying because her future is at stake,&rdquo; said Thembisile. Another parent (45) said: &ldquo;I have two children &ndash; one in grade 10 and another in grade 12. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they will fail these subjects if the department doesn&rsquo;t intervene urgently.&rdquo; She said the problem was that this is the only high school in the area and they don&rsquo;t have an option. The SGB chairman said: &ldquo;If parents have problems with the school they must come to me, not the media.&rdquo;KZN Education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa said the department was not aware of the matter but urged the parents to report the matter to the department&rsquo;s district office. &ldquo;Once the matter is reported to the district office, it will be forwarded to us and we will work on it quickly to find a solution,&rdquo; said Mthethwa.
