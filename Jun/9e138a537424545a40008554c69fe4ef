MOTSWEDING FM’s embattled station manager Katlego Mokhele was suspended two weeks ago and replaced by veteran broadcaster, Snyman Rankane. According to insiders, Katlego had let his girlfriend run amok with the SABC’s resources.Her company was allegedly used to cater for the radio station’s 54th birthday at the Sun City resort in Rustenburg, North West, last year.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>Said the source: “He was using his woman’s company to make extra cash on the side. He now faces disciplinary action after a forensic report revealed irregularities in the station’s finances.”The SunTeam’s attempts to get comment from the couple drew a blank.But Katlego is not the first radio station manager at the SABC to be fingered an the audit report, accused of forging documents, or of using the public broadcaster’s funds in an irregular manner.In 2012, Sibongile Mtyali – a former acting station manager at Motsweding FM and now boss at Metro FM – was at the centre of a forensic report for allegedly claiming miles and money for trips she hadn’t made.But the SABC didn’t take action against her, claiming there had been infighting at the station.The SABC has been on the news after the communications portfolio committee in Parliament was told the public broadcaster was facing financial problems. It is not known when Katlego’s disciplinary hearing will take place, but his girlfriend was allegedly barred from working with the radio station in April.SABC spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, said: “The SABC is not in a position to comment on an employer- and employee-related matter.”
