BAFANA BAFANA midfielder Andile Jali is starting to enjoy life in Belgium &ndash; following his spate of injuries.&nbsp;But after three-and-half years in Belgium, Jali is ready to move to a bigger league &ndash; but not just yet, as his club KV Oostende have exercised an option to renew his contract for another year.But now that his side have qualified for the Uefa Europa Cup, he&rsquo;ll have a chance to showcase his talent to a wider range of audience, and hopefully clubs will vie for his signature.In fact, Jali revealed he almost signed for Leeds United last season, but Bafana Bafana&rsquo;s Fifa ranking knocked out the deal as he could not secure a work permit to play in England.&nbsp;He said he was also on the verge of signing for a Chinese club, but the deal also fell through after the club owner sold his company and that affected the club&rsquo;s coffers.But he said he was not disappointed that the moves did not materialise, and would work hard to secure a move in the near future.Jali has been plagued by injuries but says he&rsquo;s over them and ready to unleash his true potential. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be back after so long,&rdquo; he said.The last time Jali played for Bafana in April, there were concerns about his weight, but the 27-year-old denied that he had gained a bit of weight.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have weight issues,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that people didn&rsquo;t see me in a long time and they started talking. But that didn&rsquo;t bother me at all as I knew it was not the case. If that was the case, my club would have told me to work on it.&rdquo;He said he liked Belgium and would stick around for another season and see what happened thereafter.The former Orlando Pirates star, who has been linked with a move to Mamelodi Sundowns, said coming back home was not an option at this moment.&nbsp;He said he&rsquo;d like to stay in Europe for another three years before returning to the country.&ldquo;But sometimes loyalty doesn&rsquo;t pay the bills, money talks. If I get more money at home, then I&rsquo;ll consider it, rather than just staying in Europe,&rdquo; he added.
