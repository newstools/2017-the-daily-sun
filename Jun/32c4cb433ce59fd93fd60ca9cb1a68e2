AN elegantly dressed EFF leader, Julius Malema told the South African Property Owners Association that "The land is everything."Malema said this at a conference under the theme "disruption" at the Cape Town International Conference Centre today.He did not hold back in his speech, as he criticised property owners for not doing enough to change property ownership post-apartheid, but also encouraged them to join the fight against corruption.Taking his stand behind the podium in chinos and a blazer rather instead of his infamous red overalls, Malema said he was surprised to be invited to the event."Sitting here today are the beneficiaries of a crime against humanity," he said after he tied the current property ownership patterns to apartheid.He said the same people are also the greatest beneficiaries post-apartheid and that profits and greed were placed above reconciliation.He said the country is heading towards failure, and property owners should shoulder some of the blame as they often scupper government policies aimed to alleviate poverty. "Your riches made you self-centred.""If there is a disruption we need today, it is your neoliberal short-sightedness."He said there are many pieces of unused land. "Without a disruption, they are unwilling to share the land.""Our fellow patriotic white people must stop being oversensitive."He said the ANC and DA won't be able to help them because they still believe neo-liberalism can be saved. He said the 1913 Native Land Act is still manifested."When the EFF take over, we will ensure the state owns all the land." "The land belongs to all South Africans."He said anyone who believed otherwise is blind to black suffering."The state must be the custodian of the land. Why? Because you are refusing to release the land.""The struggle has always been about property ownership."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/malema-reads-property-owners-the-riot-act-20170621
