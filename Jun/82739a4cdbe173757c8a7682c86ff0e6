GRAVES are supposed to be respected and cleaned.But those at the cemetery in Tsebe section, Klipgat, near Mabopane are swimming in a pool of kak.Sewage has covered the graves since a drain in the area was blocked three months ago. Residents said what&rsquo;s happening shows disrespect to the dead.Some said in their culture the dead were their ancestors and should be respected at all times.Resident Manku Malebane (51) said her mother&rsquo;s grave was covered in kak. &ldquo;I find this very disturbing because we need to go to the graves to perform cultural rituals but we can&rsquo;t even get near because of the sewage running everywhere in the cemetery.&rdquo; Manku said some tombstones were being washed away by the water.Another resident, Violet Chauke (61), said she couldn&rsquo;t trace her father&rsquo;s grave.She believes it has been swept away by the sewage.She said her family was not aware of the condition in the cemetery until Good Friday, when they went to perform a ritual on the grave. &ldquo;We found sewage flowing all over the place and we couldn&rsquo;t enter the cemetery. &ldquo;We went there again last month hoping the situation had changed but it was worse than last time.&rdquo;Councillor Tshepo Motaung said he was not aware of the situation but would find out about it and attend to it.
