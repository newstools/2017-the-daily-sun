WHEN mum Nozuko Makabane (38) learned that her daughter had been abducted when she hiked home last Wednesday, she feared the worst.Thankfully, Thandolwethu Ngwenze (22) made it back home on Sunday, but it soon dawned on the family that something evil had arrived too.This was after vutha attacked the family on the same day &ndash; and every single day since!The family from Unit P, East London believes the vutha is linked to the mysterious disappearance of their daughter who decided to hike instead of taking a taxi. Nozuko told Daily Sun she had phoned Thandolwethu the day before she left Butterworth, asking her to buy pizza for the family. When she phoned again later, her daughter wasn&rsquo;t answering. The next day a stranger phoned Nozuko, saying they&rsquo;d found Thandolwethu wearing only her underwear. The stranger gave her clothes and Nozuko transferred money for her to come home. She arrived early on Sunday. &ldquo;Later that evening, while Thandolwethu was asleep, she woke us screaming for help. Her bag of clothes was on fire! I rushed to the room which was now filled with smoke and pulled her out. Thandolethu seemed motionless after the flames were killed. We were preparing to take her to a doctor on Monday morning when the vutha struck once again,&rdquo; said her terrified mum.It struck again on Tuesday after church members had prayed at the house. She said even wet clothes were burnt yesterday. &ldquo;People are jealous of my daughter because she studied and has a good job as a nurse. We would appreciate any help, but we can&rsquo;t afford to pay anyone.&rdquo;
