PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma yesterday presented his budget vote reply without interruptions as the DA, EFF and Cope boycotted the sitting. However, Zuma took a swipe at the opposition parties in their absence. &ldquo;They are not here today but they were here shouting yesterday. They do not even want to hear the reply,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are answering them and they are not here. &ldquo;What about the people who elected them to be their representatives in parliament?&rdquo; The president went on to talk about unemployment, which he said needed to be solved. &ldquo;The problem of not having jobs is a manmade problem in South Africa and it needs man to correct it,&rdquo; said Zuma, adding that land reform needed to happen to address the problem. He said the land issue in South Africa was racialised, stating that whites had too much land while black people didn&rsquo;t have a single hectare. &ldquo;The land issue must be corrected within the law and the Constitution. &ldquo;Somebody asked me if we are going to do it the Zimbabwean way. No, this is not Zimbabwe, but South Africa.&rdquo; Zuma said he had been confronted several times in parliament and accused of hating white people. &ldquo;I want to answer it today. I do not hate white people. I do have white people who are my comrades. &ldquo;I do not hate them but what I want is for them to sit down and talk about the land issue.&rdquo; Zuma added that government was working hard to fight crime. &ldquo;The current focus is the fight against crime, given the urgency and suffering of communities,&rdquo; he said. The opposition walked back into parliament as soon as Zuma finished his speech, to debate the ongoing wave of violence against women in the country.
