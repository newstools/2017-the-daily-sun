GOING into the final round of the group stages of the SuperSport Rugby Challenge, the interest is more on the third place finishers who will be the &ldquo;lucky losers&rdquo; that go through to the knockout stages of the tournament.In a competition in which the top two finishers from the three groups, the North, South and Central Pools, gain automatic passage to the quarterfinals, the remaining two teams are decided on the two third-placed finishers with the most points.The section unlikeliest to have a third-place finisher in the last eight is surprisingly the South Pool, which ironically had a dogfight of a competition for second place, what with Western Province having picked up 34 of a possible 35 points from the seven games they&rsquo;ve played.Strengthening that powerful position is the fact that they play the winless SWD Eagles in their last game at the final group stages festival, which will be held in Oudtshoorn on Sunday.But the Eagles&rsquo; task is the kind of Mission Impossible which only works out in the movies, meaning in all likelihood Western Province will finish with 39 points and an even bigger points difference than the 136 they already have.Currently, the Border Bulldogs occupy that coveted second on 22 points, but the catch is they will watch the final round of the round-robin stages from home, having finished their games last Friday. This leaves the EP Kings (20 points) and the Boland Cavaliers (17) to still contest both second or third place in the group, depending on who wins and how many bonus points they accrue in the process.The biggest issue is for all the teams is that whoever finishes third (22 or lower) will probably have less points than the other third place finishers in the other groups.In the North Pool, where the Lions (31 points) and the Bulls (27) will play in the curtain raiser for the SA A and French Barbarian game at the Orlando Stadium on Friday (5pm), the two will basically be contesting first place, given how close their last match was (the Bulls won by two points).But should the Bulls not get a win or a bonus point, the Pumas (24 points) lurk and could beat them to second, even though they find themselves in something approaching a derby with the Valke in their final game.The Central Pool has probably turned up the surprise results of the tournament so far, with the unfancied Griquas and Leopards flying out of the blocks with a few upsets in their favour at the beginning of the competition.&nbsp;While the flying start has proven a false start for the Leopards, who are marooned in fourth place after playing all eight of their games, Griquas (30 points) will finish first in the group regardless of their result against the Griffons as the Sharks XV are on 24 points.To keep their second place the Sharks XV will have to beat the other XV expected to have been in the top two positions with them before Griquas put the cat among the pigeons, the Free State.MJ Smith&rsquo;s Free Staters, after a lawnmower start to the competition, find themselves in third on 22 points and have a nasty habit of upsetting anything called the Sharks.Should they lose, they have the advantage of starting with a better points difference (minus six) than the Bulldogs (minus 49) in their quest for knockout rugby.
