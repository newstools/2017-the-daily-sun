THE University of Johannesburg (UJ) has advanced to the top 2.3% of universities globally, according to a world university ranking released earlier today. UJ was among the top 650 global institutions for 2017/2018, according to the latest Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings. The institution's high overall score was achieved, in part, by its improvement in employer reputation and its increased complement of international staff and students, UJ said in a statement. The QS World University Rankings are based on six performance indicators related to global reputation, research output and quality, internationalisation and teaching and learning. The 12-year-old UJ was the youngest of all the South African ranked universities and it is ranked in fifth position nationally. It is the only one of the top five universities in South Africa that achieved the distinction without the benefit of a medical school. "UJ outperformed the South African average for participating universities in four of the six indicators, namely employer reputation, staff-to-student ratio, international staff and international students." The university said the scores for international students and employer reputation showed the highest improvement for UJ between 2016 to 2017.
