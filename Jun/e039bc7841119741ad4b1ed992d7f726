HUNDREDS of bodies stuck in mortuaries throughout Gauteng could finally be buried. The Public Health and Social Development Sectoral Bargaining Council said it had reached an agreement, in principle, with the health department.Yesterday unions and the health department put their heads together to try and end the strike and relieve the backlog at state mortuaries. However, the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union would not be drawn into the matter, stating that it would only sign once workers had agreed to all the terms. Mortuary staff downed tools two weeks ago, demanding better pay and recognition for out-of-scope work.According to union leaders cleaners, drivers and other untrained staff have been conducting post mortems and dissecting bodies for years now. However Khutso Rabothatha, the department&rsquo;s spokesman, said they don&rsquo;t yet have the final report on negotiations with the union. The downing of tools resulted in bodies piling up, leaving families frustrated and unable to bury their loved ones.Sibongile Buthelezi (43) from Alexandra said they&rsquo;ve had to postpone their nephew&rsquo;s funeral twice. &ldquo;When we planned the funeral we didn&rsquo;t know there was an ongoing strike. &ldquo;He died on 2 June. All the food and other costs for the preparations went to waste.&rdquo; Johan Rousseau, the funeral industry authority&rsquo;s chairman, said this was a longstanding problem with government. &ldquo;There still haven&rsquo;t been any concrete solutions,&rdquo; he said.
