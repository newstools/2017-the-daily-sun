TANZANIAN government officials are threatening to throw the book at local organisations that work to support gay rights.According reports, Interior Minister Mwigulu Nchemba told the state-owned Daily News: "I would like to remind and warn all organisations and institutions that campaign and pretend to protect homosexual interests ... we are going to arrest whoever is involved and charge them in courts of law."Nchemba threatened that they&rsquo;d be deported so swiftly that &ldquo;they will not have even the time to unplug their mobile phones from the socket" before being kicked out of the country.Male homosexuality is illegal in Tanzania, with those convicted facing anything from 30 years to life imprisonment. There is no such law for lesbians. Usually the anti-gay laws aren&rsquo;t acted on, but the government has recently upped their threats against the community. Last Thursday, President John Magufuli said: "Those who teach such things do not like us, brothers. They brought us drugs and homosexual practices that even cows disapprove of." &nbsp;Last July, the government cracked down on homosexuality with a raid on clubs in Dar es Salaam. The dozens of men who were detained were taken to hospital to undergo anal exams to confirm their homosexuality, said the report.Homosexuality is legally accepted in only 16 out of 54 African countries. It is punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan and Somalia, according to Amnesty International.
