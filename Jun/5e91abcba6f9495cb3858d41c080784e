IT SEEMS reigning World Boxing Organisation (WBO) bantamweight champion Zolani &ldquo;Last Born&rdquo; Tete&rsquo;s dream of unifying several crowns has suffered a cruel blow.Tete, who is on a mission to be a multiple champion, defeated Arthur Villanueva in the final eliminator in April to be elevated to full world champion status. Then, shortly after Ryan Burnett outclassed Lee Haskins at Belfast&rsquo;s SSE Arena to claim the International Boxing Federation (IBF) bantamweight world title, the talented South African southpaw threw down the gauntlet for a unification contest against the newly crowned 25-year-old IBF champion.But the former British bantamweight champion&rsquo;s camp was reluctant to meet the highly regarded warrior from Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape. According to Tete&rsquo;s manager, Mlandeli &ldquo;Mla&rdquo; Thengimfene, their British promoter Frank Warren of Queensberry Promotions tabled their offer to Burnett&rsquo;s camp but they turned it down.&ldquo;Warren made offers to them for a unification bout against our champion but they turned him down, saying they are not interested in fighting Tete.&nbsp;&ldquo;We even offered to fight them in their backyard in Belfast on their terms and they still refused,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We went beyond the call of duty, even taking Tete to them for free, meaning the British promoter would pay the South African boxer&rsquo;s purse and travelling expenses. "We also said that should we win we would take the responsibility of tackling the mandatory IBF defence first and then our voluntary WBO defence,&rdquo; Thengimfene explained.Boxing South Africa&rsquo;s 2016 Manager of the Year said that although the opponent apparently wanted to run away from the skilful fighter they would not give up on a unification contest.&ldquo;The boys in his weight class know him &ndash; even (Lee) Haskins ran away from us.&nbsp;&ldquo;We have even been looking at a unification battle against WBA (World Boxing Association) super champion Zhanat Zhakiyanov, but that fight would not sell in England,&rdquo; Thengimfene said. For now Tete&rsquo;s camp will focus on his voluntary defence. They have yet to pick one of the top 16 rated WBO contenders, including WBO intercontinental bantamweight champ Siboniso Ngonya from KwaZulu-Natal, who is fourth in the rankings.
