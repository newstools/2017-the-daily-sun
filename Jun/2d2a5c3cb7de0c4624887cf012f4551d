THE Gauteng Education Department is worried about the rise in cases of pupils assaulting teachers. Statistics show that over the past three years, violence against teachers has risen at an alarming rate. Between 2014 and last year, a total of 56 pupils faced serious charges of misconduct and 14 were expelled. The department has said it&rsquo;s displeased with these numbers and has been informed of a number of cases of assault in the east and north of Joburg. Some of the incidents reported involved pupils slapping, beating, kicking and throwing objects at teachers. There were also incidents of teachers being hit while trying to stop fights between pupils and of teachers being threatened. The department has strongly condemned such behaviour in schools and has taken a zero tolerance approach to bullying or any form of misconduct on the part of pupils. Gauteng Education spokesman Oupa Bodibe said anyone falling foul of these policies would be dealt with in line with the South African Schools Act, which governs all schools. &ldquo;We urge pupils to follow the school code of conduct and for teachers to show a high level of professionalism at all times. We have urged all schools to enforce their codes of conduct and to deal with bullying and other disciplinary matters.&rdquo;
