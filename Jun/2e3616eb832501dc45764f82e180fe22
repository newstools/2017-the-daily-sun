THE world has changed and these days, students are expected to do things like type and upload assignments and do research online. This has led to many people worrying that children in poorer areas are at risk of falling behind. Thuso Phecheni started Thuso Education to bring technology to disadvantaged areas and teach kids about learning online. &ldquo;The education department is taking too long with rural development. I have received requests for help from schools in rural areas where even principals don&rsquo;t have computers. &ldquo;Some of the schools rely on internet cafes in town,&rdquo; she said. Thuso said online collaboration tools which could be found on Google Apps allowed pupils and instructors to share documents online, edit them and project them onto screens. &ldquo;This helps pupils brainstorm ideas and document their work using text and images.&rdquo; Thuso said her project taught pupils how to do things like linking tablets to computers, projectors and the cloud. She said she also showed teachers how to use clickers and smartphones to survey pupils during class. Thuso said teachers could use lecture capture tools like Panopto to record their lessons so that pupils could later upload them and watch them again. She said studies had shown that recording classes did not lead to fewer pupils attending. &ldquo;It can be very challenging for someone who has no computer background to use these tools. It&rsquo;s important to teach students these skills to prevent them from dropping out,&rdquo; said Thuso. &ldquo;Many pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds do very well at school level but when they go to institutions of higher learning they find themselves struggling to use technology.&rdquo;
