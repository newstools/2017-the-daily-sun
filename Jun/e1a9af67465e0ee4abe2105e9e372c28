“OUR goal as the social development department is that no one in our province should go hungry.” This was what Gauteng MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza told the media at the Gauteng legislature yesterday after her annual budget speech. She said her budget had been increased from R4,2 billion to R4,4 billion in the previous financial year and it was expected to reach R5 billion in the 2019/2020 financial year. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvRLyxmVdu4xjtCZ7Hw2vOXYmpgkEnqGYCBOdIvPd2i9W13NiENL1wSWP_Vdz7kOurQHjrf9G2C1lP3HgU8tIdeDabJk2cLtNhcnv9JuRt5RrKiDe24Uh9MsKruZO-AnOdHs5-VCG3YqQ5YfpiUDamn6iviV1M4GkINFz8vo_nmZLJ6uBqsIv83e2gkDj_p4dxbzU-f6qsQiTpqDyr6xHgpVY2knHWwPsBIXKNrvKCm3JqI5pgUUnzjRRIk7dHhIkOKluzx1yndn0znFikBr_mnfmUNut0\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMElTNxEWYy6EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It showcases the heroic revolt of the Class of 1976,” said Mayathula-Khoza. “Youth empowerment is critical to the work we do. It’s sad that 2,7 million young people can’t further their studies and are unemployed. “The Tshepo 500 000 initiative launched by the premier two years ago has now reached 354 633 people and the target has been increased to empower one million young people by 2019.” She said this year’s budget would support the Tshepo One Million programme, through the introduction of a project to recruit and train young people for professions such as housekeeping, waitressing and hairdressing.Young women dependent on child support grants will be equipped with skills and decent employment opportunities so they become self reliant,” she said.
