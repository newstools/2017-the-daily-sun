SHOCKED nyaope addicts gathered around the body of one of their friends on Friday morning. The young man from Ramogodi, near Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane, is believed to have overdosed on Bluetooth.His devastated friend said the dead man was recently released from prison.&ldquo;When I saw him on Thursday night he was excited and high. He did not look okay but he continued to inject himself. &ldquo;When he first injected himself, he almost fainted. Then he injected himself again and fell down. &ldquo;I was shocked,&rdquo; said the friend.He said at first he was not bothered because it was common to feel dizzy after a shot. &ldquo;We waited for him to recover so that we could draw blood from him and share it. &ldquo;Instead he woke up and asked for water.&rdquo; The friend said they decided to leave him to recover as he had fallen asleep again. &ldquo;I was shocked when we were called the next morning and were told that he had been found dead.&rdquo; Martha Poopedi, a resident, said they noticed the man lying there and thought he was asleep.&ldquo;However, we became concerned when hours went by and he did not wake up. We tried waking him but he did not respond. That is when we realised something was wrong,&rdquo; said Martha. She said the dead man is well known in the area as he often hung around the busy train station not far from where he died.Martha said the addicts gather near her house and inject themselves with Bluetooth.&ldquo;Most people say it is dangerous, unhealthy and pure madness. &ldquo;But for addicts it is a bargain, because they share,&rdquo; she said.Police spokeswoman Constable Zanele Mtsweni said an inquest docket has been opened.
