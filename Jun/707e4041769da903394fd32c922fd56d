WHEN Japhta Masilela (52) got a mysterious call telling him where he could find his missing daughter, he didn&rsquo;t hesitate.He found his daughter, but now he is haunted by a tokoloshe.

He went with his brother and found nothing, but the second time he went with his son and found his daughter.Then the man demanded money. &ldquo;He told me to bury R800 in a tin in the yard,&rdquo; said Japhta.&ldquo;I did as I was told. When I checked later, the money was gone.&rdquo;Japhta said the man keeps calling and demanding cash.&ldquo;Even if we hide our money with relatives, it disappears,&rdquo; said Elizabeth. They believe a tokoloshe has been sent to terrorise them. They received threatening SMSes so they gave up their phones, but on Friday they found a letter on a table in their house. They believe it was written by the tokoloshe. &ldquo;The note told us to stop going to church because that won&rsquo;t help us. It warned us not to relocate as trouble will follow us,&rdquo; she said.Sunnyboy Msiza, the chairman of the Traditional Healers&rsquo; Association, said the family is being terrorised by a mgijimi type of evil spirit. &ldquo;They need a strong inyanga that has muthi to chase it away. I will send them to someone powerful and they will never suffer again.&rdquo;
