CHIEF Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng was very clear in his judgment yesterday morning. He said: &ldquo;Now that Mbete has been properly guided, she is free to decide the appropriate voting procedure.&rdquo;This means Speaker Baleka Mbete now has to declare her position on the secret ballot.Members of opposition parties were seen smiling and hugging in the court gallery.Addressing the media, UDM leader Bantu Holomisa said: &ldquo;Those ANC MPs are free to vote and follow their conscience.&rdquo; This comes after Mogoeng said: &ldquo;The Speaker of the National Assembly has the constitutional power to prescribe that voting in a motion of no confidence in the President of the Republic of South Africa be conducted by secret ballot.&rdquo; He said the Constitution required members of parliament to swear obedience to the Constitution and the law.&ldquo;Nowhere does the supreme law provide for them to swear allegiance to their political parties,&rdquo; said Mogoeng.The UDM made an application to the court to force Mbete to conduct the vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma by secret ballot after he reshuffled Cabinet, and axed the then finance minister and his deputy. Cope leader Mosioua Lekota said the judgment was a triumph for democracy while EFF treasurer general Leigh-Ann Mathys said the opposition would stand together for the motion of no confidence. The DA&rsquo;s federal executive chairman, James Selfe, said: &ldquo;ANC MPS now have the opportunity to remove the toxic president.&rdquo;
