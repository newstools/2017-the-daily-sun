THESE residents say they won&rsquo;t rest until a killer on the loose is caught. This comes after the body of an elderly woman was found floating in a small river in Langaville, Ekurhuleni, in the early hours of Friday morning. The community of extension 1 gathered around the body in shock after word of the discovery spread. It was soon established that the woman had a wound to the head and her panties were missing. The woman was later identified as 68-year-old Sinah Tshwene, who lived in Tsakane extension 1. Outraged community member Dimakatso Matsobane (45) said she had never seen anything like it before. &ldquo;We always read about women being killed and burned. We never thought we would witness this in our area. &ldquo;People must go to the cops with information because next time it could be one of our family members in that river.&rdquo; A case of murder was opened at Tsakane Police Station and the cops are investigating.
