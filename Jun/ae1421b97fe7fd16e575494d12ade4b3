THE family had been living in fear of the naughty monkey for days . . . But on Friday morning, the animal was found dead at their gate! Mabu Mbuthu (39), Free State Human Settlements MEC Sisi Ntombela&rsquo;s daughter, told Daily Sun she heard footsteps on the roof of her house in Heuwelsig, Bloemfontein, every night. &ldquo;In my dreams, my ancestors advised me to pray,&rdquo; said Mabu. &ldquo;After praying for a week, we found the evil monkey that had been giving us sleepless nights dead.&rdquo; She would wake up in the middle of the night and hear someone, or something, dancing on the roof. &ldquo;In the mornings, I would see the monkey, sitting inside our yard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have dreams where someone threw a crab in my face, and my body would become heavy.&ldquo;It was as if someone was sitting on top of me. On Thursday night, I prayed like I had never prayed before. &ldquo;In the morning, I found the monkey dead, but it had no wounds or blood on its body. I think it was sent by a jealous person.&rdquo;Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said the monkey was sent to the house to kill someone in the family. &ldquo;Prayer made it weak, which is why it ended up dying,&rdquo; said the sangoma. MEC Ntombela could not be reached for comment. Her phone rang unanswered.INSET: The monkey had been dancing on the roof for days.
