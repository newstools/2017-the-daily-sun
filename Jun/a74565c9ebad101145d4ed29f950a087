ALL Enos Ngutshane wanted was for the government of the day to stop shoving Afrikaans down black pupils&rsquo; throats. The 61-year-old, then a pupil at Naledi High School in Soweto, was a regional leader of the South African Students Movement.Just weeks before the June 16 Soweto Uprising, he had written a letter to MC Botha, apartheid&rsquo;s education minister of the time. The letter criticised the use of Afrikaans in kasi schools. Four decades later, a monument has been set up at the school in his honour.The monument bears his picture and the famous letter he wrote 41 years ago!The letter reads: &ldquo;By enforcing Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in our school, you are creating a big problem for us as black students. &ldquo;You are now closing a door for us to continue with acquiring decent education. &ldquo;Afrikaans is not our mother language and it&rsquo;s a language that we find difficult to understand.&ldquo;We are not going to have Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in our school. It is just not possible. Our language preference is English and nothing else.&rdquo;Enos told Daily Sun said the letter led to his arrest on 8 June that year. &ldquo;When the police came to arrest me, their car was burned to ashes by pupils while they were in the principal&rsquo;s office with me.&ldquo;That was the first sign of the mounting anger and frustration shown by black pupils towards the apartheid system. This incident was a more powerful motivator for the June 16 march.&rdquo;Enos was arrested but released a few days later. &ldquo;Looking back, I believe I was lucky to have survived. Those days were a living hell.&ldquo;Unlike today&rsquo;s youth, we had a vision. We only burned Bantu administration offices, bottle-stores and drinking holes that were destroying our communities. &ldquo;We never burnt a single school, clinic, library or hospital. We were disciplined. Today&rsquo;s youth is misguided and ill-disciplined. It&rsquo;s very disappointing.&rdquo;
