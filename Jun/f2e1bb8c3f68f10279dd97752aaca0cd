LONG distance runner, Claude Moshiywa is hoping that his luck will change for the better when he hits the road at this year&rsquo;s Old Mutual Soweto Marathon.&nbsp;Moshiywa has had poor results in this year&rsquo;s races. He registered 3:21.42 in the 56km long Two Oceans Marathon in the 15th position and 48th &nbsp;spot in this year&rsquo;s Comrades Marathon up run after 6:21.36.&nbsp;Moshiywa said he needs to intensify his training for him to have a better showing at the Soweto Marathon on 5 November at the FNB Stadium.This year&rsquo;s race was already sold out with four months to go having had registered 25 000 runners in the 10km, 21km and 42km distances.&nbsp;Sintayehu Legese Yinesu and Selam Abere Alebachew will also attempt to successfully defend their titles in both the men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s categories respectively.Yenesu has won the race back to back in 2015 and last year.Mike Fokoroni, Lehlohonolo Raletebele,Fikile Mbuthuma abd Beryl Makoka are some of the other athletes who will take part at this year&rsquo;s race.&nbsp;Moshiywa said although preparing for a 42km is tough exercise, he has faith that he will do well.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to win a 42km, especially for me. To train for the 42km, you need a lot of time and being a full time employee, means I don&rsquo;t get to do that well. "I would have to put in six days of training with enough sleep. I have to wake up early to go to work and train when I knock off.&rdquo; The former Comrades winner said he would be happy making the top 10 in the contest.&nbsp;He added that the Soweto Marathon route is one of the toughest in the country.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of hills and the race being in November, it is hot and dry around that time. In training for it, I have to include a lot of hills and speed training consistently,&rdquo; he added. &nbsp;
