THE DA will not proceed with disciplinary action against Western Cape Premier Helen Zille for her colonialism tweets, but will remove her from the party&rsquo;s decision-making structures.Party leader Mmusi Maimane yesterday told journalists at a press conference in Joburg that the party had accepted her unconditional apology. Zille has been slapped on the wrist for her comments, which led to a reduction in new DA members, but will remain Western Cape premier. James Selfe, the party&rsquo;s federal executive chairman, admitted in a radio interview that Zille would have been found guilty of bringing the party into disrepute, had she gone through a disciplinary hearing. This could have triggered a long and painful process if she had decided to take the DA to court. He disagreed when it was suggested that not recalling Zille was like spitting in the face of black members and insisted she was governing the Western Cape well. Maimane said it was important for the party to remain focused on reconciliation. When asked about EFF leader Julius Malema&rsquo;s threat to pull out of coalitions with the DA if Zille was not removed as premier, Maimane appealed to opposition parties not to lose focus of their goal to beat the ANC in 2019. Zille said that after reflecting on her actions, she realised how much damage her tweets had caused. She said: &ldquo;I recognised my actions were insensitive to South Africans who suffered under colonial oppression. For this, I am genuinely sorry.&rdquo;
