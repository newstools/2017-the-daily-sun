MZANSI will know tomorrow whether the vote of no confidence in parliament against President Jacob Zuma will be conducted by secret ballot. The Constitutional Court issued a statement yesterday announcing it would be delivering a judgment on the UDM&rsquo;s application to force National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to allow a secret vote. The matter was heard by the court on 15 May after the UDM and other opposition parties asked the court to determine whether the Constitution requires, permits or prohibits motions of no confidence to be done by secret ballot. The matter was taken to court after Zuma&rsquo;s cabinet reshuffle when he axed finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. Opposition parties asked Mbete to schedule a vote of no confidence in Zuma, which was initially set down for 18 April but was postponed for the court decision. The opposition argued in court that Zuma&rsquo;s decision led to South Africa being downgraded to junk status.They also claimed MPs had been threatened with violence if they voted in favour of removing Zuma. The parties said allowing a secret ballot would allow ANC MPs to vote against Zuma because there would be no fear of intimidation. Mbete said if the court found she had the power to order a motion of no confidence via secret ballot, she would act in accordance with the ruling.
