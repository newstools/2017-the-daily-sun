spokesperson Prem Balram said the incident took place on Flamingo Way in
Dawncrest at about 4pm.The argument between the
neighbours was sparked by a plastic packet that was lying on the road, said
Balram."During the argument, the
off duty policeman drew his firearm and fired approximately 12 rounds at his
neighbour," he said."Several of the rounds struck
the victim's Kia bakkie while one bullet entered the victim's abdomen and
exited through his back. The policeman then fled the scene," Balram said.Gwala said the suspect was later
arrested for attempted murder. He will appear in court soon, added Gwala.
