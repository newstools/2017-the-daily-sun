BAROKA coach Kgoloko Thobejane has emphasised that his charges will need to score goals when the new Absa Premiership season starts to avoid being involved in a relegation dogfight again.Bakgaka retained their PSL status via the relegation/promotion play-offs at the weekend when they drew 1-1 with Black Leopards at Thohoyandou Stadium to finish top of the mini-league table with eight points. They ended three points ahead of second placed Lidoda Duvha, while Stellenbosch FC finished bottom on two points.Said Thobejane: &ldquo;I am excited that we survived relegation. I will finally have a good night&rsquo;s sleep, even though a draw was not what we wanted in this game. But we accept the results, as we&rsquo;ve achieved our target. &ldquo;My boys played good football throughout the season but if luck is not on your side there is nothing you can do. We will need to remain humble and work hard to improve the performance of the team. I also want to see them score a lot of goals next season, something we could not achieve last season.&rdquo;Thobejane revealed that the management would decide whether to beef up his squad or not when the new season starts in August. &ldquo;If they want to change the team, they will do so and if not, that&rsquo;s fine too. I don&rsquo;t play with names in my team, as long as I have 11 players on the pitch. We would like to win anything on offer in the PSL but if we can&rsquo;t achieve that, it wouldn&rsquo;t be the end of the world.&rdquo;Baroka defender Punch Masenamela believes being involved in the play-offs was a wake-up call for players ahead of the new PSL season.&ldquo;I am not happy about my performance but I am happy about the result. We didn&rsquo;t come here for a draw but to learn something the players will remember. &ldquo;A draw was enough for us to stay in the PSL. This was a great lesson to learn ahead of the new season. We will try not to be in this situation again.&rdquo;
