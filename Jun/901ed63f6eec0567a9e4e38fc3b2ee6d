ANDREW Mtshamiri (31) was walking home after buying pizza. Little did he know that two thugs were following him. Minutes after he arrived home last Friday night, the thugs allegedly kicked down the door and stormed into his room. They apparently demanded money so they could buy their own pizza! His girlfriend, Thandeka Mthimunye (28), who was with him in their rented room in Angelo squatter camp, Boksburg, said they had told the men they didn&rsquo;t have any money. &ldquo;This made the thugs angry. They told Andrew that he was playing games with them and produced a gun.&ldquo;Andrew begged them not to kill him and reached out for his wallet, which had a few rands in it. The men just shot him dead,&rdquo; said Thandeka. She said her boyfriend of two years died in her hands.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m haunted by his screams as he begged them not to kill him.&rdquo;Thandeka said her boyfriend was a loving and caring person.&ldquo;He was also my friend. We shared a lot of things. I still can&rsquo;t believe he is dead. It&rsquo;s like dreaming,&rdquo; she said.Thandeka said she&rsquo;s afraid to live in the room.&ldquo;I see him sitting next to me. I can&rsquo;t sleep at night, as the images of that day flash in my mind. Sadly, the killers are still on the run. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still shocked that my boyfriend died for a pizza.&rdquo;Thadeka said Andrew was doing well and had just found a new job this year.Community leader Thandazile Qwabe said they were worried by the high crime rate in the area.
