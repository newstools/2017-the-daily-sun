A BURDEN of several years has been lifted off the shoulders of KwaSkhemelele residents, who had to pay a lot to travel to Manguzi cop shop.When a new mobile satellite police station was opened on Tuesday, it was the beginning of hopes for a decreased crime rate in the area.The launch, which attracted scores of excited residents, was headed by the KZN MEC for Community Safety and Liaison, Mxolisi Kaunda. Sipho Khumalo (27) from Lulwane Village said the new satellite police station brought huge relief.&ldquo;It feels so good that we are now going to be serviced by a police station closer to home. &ldquo;I used to pay R64 to travel to Manguzi SAPS. Such a huge taxi fare was unaffordable for most people,&rdquo; he said.Zama Tembe (25) from ZamaZama Village said criminals were roaming the streets and robbing people in broad daylight, knowing that cops were far away.&ldquo;The presence of a cop shop closer to us will probably scare them off,&rdquo; she said.Kaunda said the opening of the new cop shop will improve policing in the corridor between Mhlabuyalingana and Manguzi and help to deal with cross-border crimes. &ldquo;This is in addition to a R90 million upgrade of Manguzi Police Station. &ldquo;We are investing all necessary resources to end the scourge of vehicle theft and all other forms of crime in the area.&rdquo; Daily Sun reported earlier this year on the increase in incidents of car theft at the Mozambican-South African border.President Jacob Zuma and the then minister of police, Nathi Nhleko, visited the area to find a solution.When the local police management briefed Kaunda before the handover, it appeared that a number of people implicated in various crimes were arrested and some stolen vehicles were recovered.
