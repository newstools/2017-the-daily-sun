YESTERDAY morning 300 young people were rescued from human trafficking! The Gauteng government sprang into action after learning they were stranded in Wonder Park, Tshwane, after being promised jobs by a man claiming to be a colonel in the South African National Defence Force. According to a source, the man had promised men and women from KZN between the ages of 18 and 30 jobs with the SANDF. It was alleged the man collected an undisclosed amount of money from the victims&rsquo; parents. The young people had been stranded next to Wonder Park Shopping Complex since last week. Some of them were said to have left to go to unknown destinations. It was discovered the group had been living at a house owned by the man, who collected R300 from each of them after promising to train them in security or military work. Yesterday the Gauteng Social Development Department dispatched a team of social workers to the scene to assist with feeding the victims and transporting them back home. The SANDF was attending to the matter through its military police. Social development department spokesman Mbangwa Xaba said a team was helping the displaced people get back home. &ldquo;We are still investigating the matter. &ldquo;At the moment we have 300 people who are said to have been at that house who need to be moved and reunited with their families.&rdquo;
