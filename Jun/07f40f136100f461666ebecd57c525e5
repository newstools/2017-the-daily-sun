MOOKGO Mongale is a worried woman.For the past four years, she&rsquo;s been struggling to find work or send her daughter to school. The 29-year-old mum of four from Mandela Park section 3, QwaQwa said Home Affairs issued her an ID saying she was a man. &ldquo;This situation has affected me badly because I can&rsquo;t find work or even send my child to school.&ldquo;My nine-year-old daughter cannot be admitted to school because she doesn&rsquo;t have a birth certificate,&rdquo; said Mookgo.&ldquo;My other kids don&rsquo;t get grants because of the wrong ID. My life is like hell. I can&rsquo;t look after my children because I&rsquo;m unemployed. &ldquo;We all depend on my gogo&rsquo;s pension money.&rdquo; Mookgo said she wanted to do a course in basic computer skills, but she couldn&rsquo;t because of the ID problem.&ldquo;I am unable to shape my future because of the ID problem. I am not a man!&rdquo;Rebecca Moshoeshoe of Home Affairs in QwaQwa said Mookgo should visit their offices to reapply for an ID.&ldquo;I am appealing to everyone to ensure that their ID numbers start with the first six numbers.&ldquo;The seventh number appearing on ID number shows if a person is a man or a woman. &ldquo;The numbers 0 to 4 represent a woman.&ldquo;But if the seventh number starts with 5 to 9, then it shows that person is a man.&rdquo;She said people must check those numbers after getting their IDs.&ldquo;I urge every resident to visit our offices immediately when they notice a mistake on their ID numbers,&rdquo; said Moshoeshoe.
