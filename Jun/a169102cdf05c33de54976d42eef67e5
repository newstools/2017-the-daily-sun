TODAY marks another big day in our lives. And Sunday Sun spoke to different celebs to understand what Father&rsquo;s Day meant to them.Rapper Maraza (real name Sphamandla Mhlongo) said he&rsquo;d spend the day with his kids.He told SunBuzz: &ldquo;I lost my dad when I was three years old, so I don&rsquo;t have memories. But every year on Father&rsquo;s Day I call my mum and talk about my dad.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful that I receive gifts, but I love the drawings I get from my kids every year. They&rsquo;re a symbol of their love for me,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Being there for your kids helps them psychologically. It&rsquo;s a precious thing to watch your kid grow despite the relationship you have with their mothers. We have to fill the void because it will affect them when they grow up.&ldquo;The father figure I once had was my stepdad and he was a cool dad. He inspired me to be a great dad.&rdquo;Dancer and actress Bontle Modiselle also lost her dad when she was young and didn&rsquo;t really have reason to celebrate Father&rsquo;s Day.&ldquo;I usually honour my mum because she plays both roles. I lost my dad in 1997, so I won&rsquo;t say much about celebrating this day. It&rsquo;s great to celebrate our dads as much as we celebrate our mums. They deserve the same level of love and appreciation,&rdquo; she said.Today she&rsquo;s planning something simple for her father-in-law.&ldquo;My partner&rsquo;s dad is a simple person. We&rsquo;re just going to spoil him.&rdquo;Singer Lungi Naidoo said she&rsquo;d be with her dad today.Said the Durban-born singer: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at home, which is when I&rsquo;ll be able to spend time with my dad.&rdquo;She said fathers should be celebrated, especially the ones who were present in their children&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp;&ldquo;Women should make time and go the extra mile with the fathers. They always go through the most to make us happy and we overlook that because we always think they&rsquo;re simple.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes we need to make a huge fuss about the day, shock and make them feel important. This will be some sort of motivation and boost their egos.&rdquo;Her daughter&rsquo;s father passed on last year, so she aimed to focus the day on her daughter.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her out so that she doesn&rsquo;t think much about her late dad. They were close and she always made this day strictly about her dad. So this year will be different for her,&rdquo; she said.Skeem Saam actor and rapper, Bongani Masondo , said he&rsquo;d spend today with his two daughters &ndash; aged two and six years old.&nbsp;&ldquo;Usually, I don&rsquo;t spend lots of time with them, so this day is dedicated to them. I don&rsquo;t have plans, but I think that the day shouldn&rsquo;t be for gifts but about being grateful that tiny people need you to give them unconditional love.&rdquo;&nbsp;He added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfortunate that my dad and I never got on well. After my parents divorced, we grew apart. But before he died I remember celebrating Father&rsquo;s Day with him. We chilled the whole day and for the first time we connected.&rdquo;
