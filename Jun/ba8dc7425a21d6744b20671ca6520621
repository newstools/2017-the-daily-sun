WHEN Sindiswa Nyongo (36) lost her husband three years ago, she was forced to take responsibility for her kids as there was no one to look after her family.The 36-year-old mother of two said her husband was stabbed to death.&ldquo;When I received the news I was devastated but I knew right there that I needed to be strong, not for me but for my two kids,&rdquo; said Hlakula.Hlakula comes from Philippi in Cape Town, and she decided to sell chicken feet, meat, gizzards and russians in front of Gugulethu Mall. &ldquo;I had to look after my family because if I hasn&rsquo;t, we would have had no source of income. &ldquo;I decided to sell meat when I noticed that everyone loves it but that people are lazy about braaing it themselves,&rdquo; said Hlakula.She knew that there were no job opportunities and she did not have time to wait for something to happen, so she made it happen herself.&ldquo;When you have kids looking up to you, you have to act fast and come up with a decision. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I did because I did not want to fail my children after their father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; She runs her business in front of the mall because it is busy and many people go there do their shopping.&ldquo;People who do their shopping here support me and Avanza taxi drivers do too. &ldquo;I thank them for their support because without them I would not be able to take care of my family.&rdquo; She charges R10 for a russian, R1 for a chicken foot and the meat depends on how much a customer orders.Avanza driver Luvuyo Hewu said Hlakula helped them because they have to leave home before they have time to eat.&ldquo;When I leave my home without eating I know that I can get chicken feet or a russian here,&rdquo; said Luvuyo.
