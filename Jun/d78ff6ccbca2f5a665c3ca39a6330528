EASTERN CAPE MEC for Human Settlements, Helen Sauls-August, has given the go-ahead to all municipalities in the province to reallocate unoccupied RDP houses.This is despite several challenges that prevented the original owners from getting their allocated houses. The latest move by the MEC has angered a number of RDP beneficiaries who have title deeds, but no homes. One such beneficiary is 38-year-old Nobonani Resha, who lives at her mother&rsquo;s RDP house in Motherwell NU 11, Port Elizabeth. Nobonani said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learnt that the department intends to cancel the registration of house subsidies belonging to those with unoccupied RDP houses. &ldquo;I have a title deed but no home. &ldquo;The housing board and human settlements department sent me from pillar to post when I went to claim my house. &ldquo;I was told my house was approved and built somewhere. But no one can point out where it is.&rdquo;Nobonani said she registered for an RDP house in 2000.&ldquo;They keep telling me my application for an RDP house was approved. I suspect someone else is living in my house.&rdquo; Provincial human settlements spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha confirmed that the MEC has given the go-ahead to reallocate the unoccupied houses.&ldquo;She said municipalities must advertise and trace the missing beneficiaries. &ldquo;That process should allow about 21 days response before commencing the deregistration.&rdquo;
