PAKISTAN coach Mickey Arthur conceded his team was woeful in Sunday&rsquo;s ICC Champions Trophy defeat to India, but said it was an &ldquo;insult&rdquo; to suggest the squad had regressed under him.In the end, one of the most eagerly awaited matches of the tournament proved an anticlimax as India utterly dominated every aspect of a stop-start, rain-interrupted 124-run victory.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a total insult to say we&rsquo;re playing even worse,&rdquo; said the 49-year-old South African, who took on the role a little more than a year ago, after his team succumbed meekly at a packed Edgbaston ground.&ldquo;If you have a look at our records over the last year we&rsquo;ve won two series. We got ourselves from nine to eight (in the ODI rankings) and our brand of cricket has changed.&rdquo;Pakistan won the toss but nothing else went right for them as they dropped catches, persisted with bowlers who bled runs and folded inside 34 overs with the bat.&ldquo;We had a poor game,&rdquo; the former South Africa and Australia coach added. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re obviously trying our best and we&rsquo;re trying to change it.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to happen overnight. We&rsquo;re trying every day. Every time we go down to training, we try and get the basics right. We didn&rsquo;t do it today. And that&rsquo;s disappointing.&rdquo;Apart from the manner of their surrender, Pakistan are also fretting on the fitness of fast bowlers Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz.Pakistan play South Africa in their next Group B match at the same venue in Birmingham, England, tomorrow. Arthur will meet some of the players he used to coach in his home country as his charges come up against a strong Proteas team now coached by Russell Domingo. &ndash; REUTERS
