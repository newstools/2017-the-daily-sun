They must report all wrong- doings by the petroleum refinery companies in their areas.&rdquo;He emphasised that government had to take ultimate responsibility for environmental damage to human health.&ldquo;My mother and many other patients would be healthier if it was not for these refinery companies that pollute the air and water in our neighbourhoods,&rdquo; said Bongani.He said his aim was to uncover long- term geographic trends in the health of human beings in all the affected areas around the world.&ldquo;I want to help with visualisation of the earth&rsquo;s global air pollution.&rdquo;
