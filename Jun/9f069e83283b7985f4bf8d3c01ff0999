FORMER kwaito star Mavusana has finally come clean about his dirty past of drugs.&nbsp;Said the former member of popular kwaito group, Oda Meesta: &ldquo;Being on drugs for many years has been a huge challenge in my life, as it affected my music career.&nbsp;&ldquo;It made me feel like I was larger than life and on top of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;And the singer (real name Vusimuzi Ngwenya) said he was sad that he kicked the habit when it was already too late, resulting in him losing everything.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;I wa s addicted to cocaine from 2005 to 2011, which led to me being out of the music scene for many years.&nbsp;&ldquo;I was down and out. Many people had suspected that I had a drug problem, but I denied it because I was still enjoying and servicing my cocaine needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;Mavusana said being lured into drugs was easy for stars because of the pressures of the showbiz industry and easy access to money.&nbsp;But he cautioned that substance abuse led only to self-destruction.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s because he eventually lost the respect of his family members, colleagues, associates and fans.&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only did the money disappear, but my career and marriage crumbled,&rdquo; Mavusana told Sunday Sun.&nbsp;&ldquo;Most of all, I regret the lost time. While I was busy with my drug addiction, my time as a musician went backward.&rdquo;&nbsp;But the Summer Time hitmaker said he woke up from obscurity when he realised that his life had ground to a halt.&nbsp;Presently hard at work on his comeback, Mavusana said his saving grace was not rehabilitation, but through church and prayer.&nbsp;He said God had saved him.&nbsp;The musician thanked his wife, Ann Dali Ngwenya, for being his pillar of strength during his darkest days.&nbsp;He also thanked &ldquo;all the people who stood by me&rdquo;.&nbsp;The reformed Mavusana also undertook a commitment to his fans.&nbsp;He promised them a new look and pledged to release his &ldquo;amazing&rdquo; single titled Malume later this month .&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started doing music gigs,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;Fans can also catch Mavusana when the music tour, Van Toeka Af, hits their town.&nbsp;
