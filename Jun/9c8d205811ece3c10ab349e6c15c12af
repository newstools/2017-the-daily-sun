RESIDENTS of KwaGijima, Lamontville said they have feared for their lives for the past three years.The people from the south of Durban claim the retaining walls are falling down and are full of mildew and damp that cause disease. Harriet Mbatha (49) said water that collected outside her house makes her walls damp. This has damaged all my kitchen furniture. In 2014, the wall collapsed and we rebuilt it but it has gone back to being wet and has damaged my furniture. Khanyisile Mjaji (43) said whenever there is heavy rain, she worries the retaining wall will collapse into her yard.She fears kids who play there will be injured. My kids are uncontrollable. I tell them to avoid the side where the retaining walls are falling down but they forget. I can t help but worry about what might happen if they play there when I am not around, said Khanyisile.They said they reported the matter to the ward councillor but nothing has been done about it.Councillor Nolubabalo Mthembu said she is aware of the retaining wall. The problem starts when it rains. When residents report such incidents, we send people to fix it immediately. The SunTeam sent eThekwini Municipality an email about the situation at KwaGijima 10 days ago. On Tuesday, Princess Nkabane from the communications unit said: We have forwarded it to the relevant unit but they haven t responded yet. We will send you the response once they do.
