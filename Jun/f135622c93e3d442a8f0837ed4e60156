THE wheels of Mzansi&rsquo;s new locomotives appears to have been greased with dirty money!A media report yesterday pointed fingers at newly appointed deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi and his brother, Nkanyiso Buthelezi. They allegedly benefited from companies that profited from Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa tenders worth more than R150 million.The deputy minister allegedly scored the tenders during his spell as the chairman of Prasa.News24 reported that Swifambo Rail Leasing, the supplier of Prasa&rsquo;s controversial Afro 4000 locomotives, appointed Inala Shipping &ndash; a company owned by the deputy minister&rsquo;s brother &ndash; to manage the shipping and logistics for the importing of the trains.Inala then appointed Sebenza Forwarding and Shipping, a company in which the deputy minister himself is a beneficiary, to handle the customs clearing portion of the import.Sebenza confirmed to News24 that Swifambo had paid them about R100 million. However, the Buthelezis denied the contracts amounted to a conflict of interest.&ldquo;I never influenced any decision to award work to Sebenza and I received no personal gratification from any of the entities,&rdquo; said the deputy minister.Nkanyiso Buthelezi also denied any wrongdoing.Xolani Sithole, Sebenza&rsquo;s managing director, said his company&rsquo;s work with Prasa was not irregular since Buthelezi, before his resignation from the company, was a non-executive director of Sebenza.DA shadow minister for transport Manny de Freitas said the party wants to lay criminal charges against Buthelezi.He said they will also write to Transport Committee chairwoman Dikeledi Magadzi to request the Hawks appear before parliament to give an update on the progress of all investigations into Prasa.
