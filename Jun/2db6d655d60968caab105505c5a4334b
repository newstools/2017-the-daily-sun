TOURISM Minister Tokozile Xasa handed over 100 laptops to inmates at Kgosi Mampuru Correctional Centre in Tshwane on Tuesday. They were donated by Spanish IT company Amadeus and were sent to South Africa for free by Iberian Airlines. The inmates could not hide their joy when the minister officially opened their learning centre and handed over the laptops. &ldquo;We need to work together to make sure inmates are fully rehabilitated so they can contribute to their communities when they are released,&rdquo; said Xasa.She said the laptops will be used by those who are studying through the Kgosi Mampuru Learning Centre. Belinda Nombuya, one of the prisoners, said a laptop will help her. &ldquo;I do not know how to thank the minister and Amadeus for the donation. &ldquo;Instead of going through piles of books, we will just go to Google,&rdquo; she said. Belinda, who was arrested for theft, would like to become an engineer when she is released. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be an engineer. I want the community to trust me again.&rdquo; Louisa Windt, an account analyst at Amadeus, said they want to be part of the inmates&rsquo; rehabilitation. She said: &ldquo;These people will be released back into their communities but if we do not help them, they will just come back here again.&rdquo;
