SOUTH Africa &ndash; but especially the Western Cape &ndash; has seen a dramatic rise in the abuse of tik.While this has led to secondary health dangers and social problems such as an increase in sexually transmitted infections, crime and the spread of HIV/Aids. Tik also damages a user&rsquo;s body, and the heart is the first to suffer.Tik is the local name for the chemical group called methamphetamine. It&rsquo;s also known as crystal, ice and meth.Tik constantly stimulates the abuser&rsquo;s central nervous system, forcing the heart to beat harder and faster without rest.Fortunately, new research suggests that it&rsquo;s possible to reverse heart damage with proper medical treatment &ndash; a big breakthrough for people who have already quit tik. Prolonged use of tik may lead to a variety of cardiovascular problems including arrhythmias, intracranial bleeding and heart failure.The small study found that after quitting tik, participants were less likely to die, suffer a non-fatal stroke or have to be hospitalised again for heart failure when compared to those who kept abusing the drug.&ldquo;There is a chance the heart can recover from the disease if the tik abuse ends while the heart damage is in the early stages,&rdquo; the study&rsquo;s senior author, Dr Norman Mangner, said in a American College of Cardiology news release. He&rsquo;s a physician at the Heart Centre Leipzig, in Germany. The research also warns about the dangers of tik use.Breaking the habit &ldquo;The research emphasises the damage the drug problem will cause in addition to the well known short-term problems,&rdquo; said Dr Christopher O&rsquo;Connor, editor-in-chief of the journal JACC: Heart Failure, which published the study.Researchers tracked 30 tik abusers and measured their heart function to see if it improved after quitting. The patients were aged 30 years on average. Most were male and had evidence of heart failure &ndash; when the heart can&rsquo;t pump enough oxygen to the body.Dr James Januzzi, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the study shows that heart function improves after quitting. But instead of giving meth abusers heart medication, he said doctors should rather encourage them to break the dangerous habit. &ndash; HEALTH24.COM
