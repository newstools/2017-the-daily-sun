I called a sister and matron who called another doctor, who in turn said he&rsquo;d call the urologist.&ldquo;When I asked the same doctor why my scrotum had swollen, she said I would get better in time.&rdquo;&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard from the hospital since I got home. I called the matron who said I could lodge a complaint. She warned me not to speak to the media.&rdquo;Glory said he wants Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi to pay a visit to the hospital.Gauteng Health spokesman Prince Hamnca said the hospital thought the complaint had been resolved.He said the hospital would schedule another meeting with the patient and his family.Hamnca said: &ldquo;Glory is currently being helped by the physicians and the urologist at the hospital. &ldquo;Investigations showed that there was no wrongdoing on the part of the doctor.&rdquo;
