THANDEKA Mkhize has vowed that she will never forgive her neighbours . . . One of her beloved dogs was killed and buried in a shallow grave near her yard, allegedly killed by her neighbours!Thandeka had to dig up the remains and throw them in the bushes.Thandeka said instead of targeting the dogs that terrorised them, people killed hers.&ldquo;My dog is dead but he harmed no one. Why did they kill my dog and leave the dangerous ones?&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;My dog was close to my heart. I was not at home when people killed him. I only heard about it when I came home in the evening.&rdquo; Daily Sun published the story on Friday about the 10 aggressive dogs that invaded Tshelimnyama squatter camp, west of Durban, and bit residents.She admitted that some residents had complained before that her dog had attacked chickens.&ldquo;I asked for proof, but no neighbour came forward and said my dog bit their chickens. &ldquo;Everyone in this area knows that I take care of my dogs. I take them for injections so they don&rsquo;t catch rabies and other diseases. &ldquo;I think people killed my dog because they hate me. This is painful and will take time to pass.&rdquo;Councillor Sifiso Ngcobo said no one had complained to him about a dog attacking chickens.&ldquo;I encourage people in my ward to be tolerant. I&rsquo;m not aware of Thandeka&rsquo;s matter because it was not reported to me,&rdquo; he said.SPCA spokeswoman Lisa Morck said: &ldquo;We condemn the killing of any animal. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re urging people to contact the SPCA if they have complaints about animals. &ldquo;Our purpose is to create a healthy environment for animals.&rdquo;
