THE cop and his six friends marked the local bakery for their next robbery.But the robbery on Saturday in Standerton, Mpumalanga went horribly wrong and the cop and three thugs were nabbed just after robbing the couple.Brigadier Leonard Hlathi told Daily Sun seven men approached the owner and his wife while they were cashing up at closing time.The armed men robbed them of cash and fled from the scene.&ldquo;The owner chased them as his wife activated their security service. &ldquo;A swift response by Kasselman security guards and police saw the arrest of four culprits.&rdquo;Police found that one worked at Charl Cilliers Police Station. His service pistol was found in the getaway vehicle. &ldquo;The three that fled are still at large.&rdquo; Lieutenant-General Mondli Zuma said the police expect to find them soon. &ldquo;It is devastating that while police officials are fighting crime, some of our members are involved. &ldquo;We will work to nab all those responsible for crime in our ranks. I promise the team will make sure we have a watertight case against the suspects so they rot in jail.&rdquo;The cop and his accomplices appeared in the Standerton Magistrates Court on Monday and were held in custody.
