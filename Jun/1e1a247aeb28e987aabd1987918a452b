THE death toll in the Nogin Road, Isipingo shooting incident has risen to five. KZN police spokeswoman Nqobile Gwala said it came to light on Monday that a fifth person had died. He was among five people rushed to hospital in a critical condition following the shooting on Thursday. The shooting is said to be related to a drug fight. On Sunday night, 13 shacks were allegedly burnt down by unknown people. This was after the gunmen responsible for the shooting had allegedly returned to finish off survivors. A neighbour said even though nobody saw the people who set the home ablaze, it was obvious that the gunmen were continuing what they had started. &ldquo;We woke up to the homestead going up in flames. Fortunately, all the tenants had already left and there was no one inside,&rdquo; said the neighbour. Daily Sun reported that the place was a well-known drug den. Two of the dead people were allegedly whoonga sellers, while the others were customers. Gwala said the only update police had at this stage was the death toll.
