BAFANA Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu, who had a blinder of a game in Bafana&rsquo;s 2-0 victory over Nigeria on Saturday, says the secret to their huge win was keeping cool heads.Zungu, who together with tenacious Dean Furman stifled most of Nigeria&rsquo;s attacks, said they knew they had to do something special to overcome the Super Eagles side teeming with some big names that ply their trade in big overseas teams.&ldquo;We were up against a good team, Nigeria has some quality stars but we played to instructions, communicated with each other and the outcome was there for all to see,&rdquo; said Zungu who plays for Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal.&ldquo;We were compact in the opening 20 minutes but once we realised we can open them up, we went for the jugular and boy,&rdquo; he reflected.Zungu said the entire team knew that as the match progressed and with Nigeria not getting the opener, they would get frustrated and what happened thereafter is now history.&ldquo;I think in the end, the team need to be complimented for remaining level-headed especially in the opening minutes of the first half when they tried to put numbers upfront searching for that opening goal.&ldquo;And when Itu (Itumeleng Khune) released Percy Tau for the killer second goal, it was all over and could have scored a glut of goals thereafter. But all in all, this was a fantastic win for the team,&rdquo; said Zungu.The midfielder said the back four of Erick Mathoho, Tebogo Langerman, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and captain Thulani Hlatshwayo played as if their lives depended on this game.&ldquo;They were disciplined and outstanding. That is what wins your away games; a solid defence especially in the opening minutes. Our guys never gave anything away.&rdquo;&ldquo;But Keagan Dolly and Dean also helped mop up the defence when they needed numbers.&rdquo;Zungu said he always relishes playing for the country and will continue to work harder and make the country proud.&ldquo;I am so excited with the result; this was a collective team effort; it is nice to bring happiness to the country,&rdquo; he concluded.
