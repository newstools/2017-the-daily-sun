THE family of a 24-year-old man who was stabbed to death is heartbroken after the murder case was struck off the roll.On 8 December Daily Sun published a story about Bright Mhembere, who was allegedly killed by his girlfriend. Bright&rsquo;s brother, Clive Mhembere (28) from Langa, near Cape Town, said they were shocked when the case was thrown out of court on Friday.&ldquo;The case was dropped after the magistrate said the investigation was not complete. The magistrate also didn&rsquo;t receive any post mortem results. Bright&rsquo;s girlfriend made brief court appearances in February and April. &ldquo;She only appeared for a few minutes before the case was adjourned for further investigation,&rdquo; said Clive.&ldquo;The investigating officer has not spoken to my family about the progress of the case. &ldquo;My brother was stabbed and the girlfriend admitted to the murder. &ldquo;What more do they need? &ldquo;There are even people who witnessed the murder.&rdquo;National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said he will look into the matter, but said it could be a provisional withdrawal.&ldquo;When an investigation takes too long and the post mortem report is not available, the defence tends to ask for the matter to be withdrawn.&ldquo;This is because it is a waste of time for a client to come to court every day when the case is not ready. &ldquo;At times the state agrees to strike such a case off the roll if there is not enough evidence to start prosecution. &ldquo;Sometimes the presiding officers agree it is unfair to the accused to keep having a dark cloud hanging over them while the police are continuing the investigation,&rdquo; said Ntabazalila.If parties agree to a provisional withdrawal and the investigation continues, the charges are reinstated.Clive said he will not let his brother down.&ldquo;I will fight for Bright until the end.&ldquo;If I need to appeal to a higher court, I will do that.&rdquo;
