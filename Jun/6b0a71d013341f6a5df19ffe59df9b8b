SOUTH Africa&rsquo;s oldest national boxing champion, Mzonke &ldquo;The Rose of Khayelitsha&rdquo; Fana, makes his return to the local scene when he puts his SA lightweight crown on the line against Thompson &ldquo;Silence Destroyer&rdquo; Mokwana at Turffontein Race Course tomorrow. The 43-year-old former International Boxing Federation title holder is on a quest to add more world titles to his collection. Fana challenged Ghana&rsquo;s Emmanuel &ldquo;Game Boy&rdquo; Tagoe for his International Boxing Organisation world crown and Terry Flanagan for the World Boxing Organisation world title but fell short in both attempts to become world champ again, as well as in his non-title bout against Howik Bebraham in Germany three months ago.The vastly experienced Western Cape boxer will make his third title defence of the crown he won by beating Sipho Taliwe at the Orient Theatre in East London two years ago. Their much anticipated contest, which was previously cancelled twice by a different promoter, will be presented by Xaba Promotions and Events. It forms part of the 41st Soweto 16 June celebrations. The fight was schedule for last November and rescheduled for May 2017 but got cancelled at the 11th hour.Fana, after losing his last three outings, says he is ready to defend his crown and hopes everything goes according to plan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to defend the title. My team and I have been working hard,&rdquo; said Fana.The 32-year-old Mokwana from Jane Furse in Limpopo says he feels honoured to part of Youth Day celebrations and is more than ready to dethrone the seasoned campaigner. &ldquo;I have been training hard since the fight was first announced last year. &ldquo;The toughest part is the preparation and now that I&rsquo;m done with that, I&rsquo;m ready to face Fana. &ldquo;The title belongs to me &ndash; Fana should just hand it over and go live in a retirement village,&rdquo; he said.
