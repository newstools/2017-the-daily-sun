BEEF is the order of the day in the popular maskandi music genre landscape.&nbsp; This as Sizwe Dlamini loses his cool at the mere mention of Dlubheke Minister&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; According to the fuming organiser of the Nqokotho Music Festival in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, the musician refuses to refund money paid to him for a performance that never happened.&nbsp; Said Sizwe: &ldquo;Other musicians who didn&rsquo;t perform at the show three weeks ago have paid me back.&nbsp; &ldquo;I paid Dlubheke Minister (real name Dlubheke Khuzwayo) R10&thinsp;000 in April. We agreed the remaining R5&thinsp;000 would be paid after the event.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the show, staged at the Curries Fountain Stadium, was stopped as two people were killed and three others injured when a fight broke out involving Khuzani Mpungose&rsquo;s fans and Igcokama Elisha.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sizwe said his next move was to take Dlubheke to court.&nbsp; But Dlubheke insists: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not prepared to pay him a cent because he used my name and picture in his posters. And it&rsquo;s not my problem the event was stopped.&rdquo;
