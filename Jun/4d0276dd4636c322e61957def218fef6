THIS community is gatvol of the mess being made by hobos living on railway tracks.Residents of Berea in Durban told Daily Sun that a camp of shacks made out of plastic and cardboard had mushroomed on nearby railway lines and created a health hazard. A hawker who sells food at a nearby taxi rank, Nomzamo Majola (34), said the smell coming from the settlement was so bad that it was driving her customers away. &ldquo;No one wants to eat when it smells terrible and there is open sewage all around,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;There are no toilets where these people live. They relieve themselves wherever they want.&ldquo;At first there were not that many shacks next to the railway line, but now a second settlement has sprung up on the other side.&rdquo; When the SunTeam visited the area there were about 100 flimsy shacks, resembling camping tents, on both sides of a railway line. Hundreds of men and women could be seen bathing from buckets and scavenging for food. A squatter, James Lucas (28), told the SunTeam the railway line was a perfect location for shacks because Metro cops had trouble getting to them. &ldquo;They are always chasing us out of the city, but they find it hard to get down onto the railway lines,&rdquo; he said. Gugu Sisilana, a municipal spokeswoman, said the matter needed to be referred to the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). &ldquo;The railway line is their jurisdiction and queries related to it should be directed to them.&rdquo; Prasa spokesman Zama Nom-nganga said the settlement had to be demolished. &ldquo;I will go to the relevant authorities to do a follow-up. There were a few shacks erected there in March, but we demolished them. I was not aware the people had returned.&ldquo;It is a dangerous place for people to be living,&rdquo; he said.
