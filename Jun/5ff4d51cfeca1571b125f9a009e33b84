This follows after a 35-year-old pastor was robbed and hacked to death on Tuesday, allegedly by a group of gangsters known as Maroma. It&rsquo;s alleged that the man, who was a Roman Catholic priest, was robbed of his cellphone and wallet. The news broke at Chris Hani kasi in Mangaung and the community launched a manhunt to find the suspects. The dead boy was caught trying to sell the phone and was beaten to a pulp before he was set alight and killed on Wednesday at Phase 9 kasi.A resident told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired of these young boys terrorising us. If it means that killing them one by one will help, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do. &ldquo;The suspect was caught trying to sell the pastor&rsquo;s cellphone and when questioned, he confessed to killing him. That&rsquo;s when the community&rsquo;s blood boiled and he was beaten and set alight. &ldquo;I was at home when I heard the community walking past my house, armed with sjamboks and petrol.&rdquo; The family of the dead boy allegedly went to the scene and threatened to bewitch the community for killing their child.Stephen Botipe (37) said, &ldquo;Cops arrest us when we take the law into our own hands but they leave the thugs who kill our community members. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t rest until all of the suspects are caught or killed,&rdquo; said the woman. Constable Peter Kareli, a police spokesman, said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re investigating two counts of murder after a priest and a young man were killed. &ldquo;In the case of the 35-year-old man no arrests have been made yet. &ldquo;Two men aged 19 and 20 were arrested in connection with the death of the young man. &ldquo;They will appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.&rdquo;
