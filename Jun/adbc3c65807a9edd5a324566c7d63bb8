MEMBERS of the Vhembe Traditional Health Practitioners in Limpopo have distanced themselves from ritual killings. The healers, led by sangoma Mbulaheni Neluvhola, on Wednesday gathered at the Thohoyandou Indoor Sports Centre.From here, they marched peacefully to the Thohoyandou Magistrates Court. They performed rituals before marching to the court!They handed over a memorandum of grievances.Mbulaheni said they were concerned about ongoing muthi killings, the disappearance of people and the abuse of women and children. Most of the missing people are usually found dead.&ldquo;As healers, we are concerned,&rdquo; said the sangoma. &ldquo;The killing of people for muthi purposes is affecting our calling negatively.&ldquo;We want to place it on record that traditional healers don&rsquo;t use body parts to make muthi.&rdquo; Mbulaheni said body parts don&rsquo;t heal the sick.He said the marchers delivered their memorandum as a way of showing concern. &ldquo;We are very disturbed by what is happening,&rdquo; said the concerned healer. Mbulaheni said police were doing their part in catching ritual killing thugs.&ldquo;But the justice system is failing us because they release suspects,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want the courts to not give bail to those involved in serious crimes. And they should be given harsh sentences if they are found guilty.&rdquo;
