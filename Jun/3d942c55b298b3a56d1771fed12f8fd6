A FEW weeks ago, a passerby allegedly assisted Zama Sishi (31) to escape when her boyfriend tried to throw her over the bridge at Jozini Dam.But on Friday night, furious boyfriend Ayanda Nkosi (32) allegedly stormed into her rented house in Jozini, northern KZN and greeted her with a hail of bullets.Ayanda, who was apparently originally from Hluhluwe, is believed to have turned a gun on himself and blew out his brains.Both of them died on the spot.A relative of Zama s told Daily Sun the couple has been fighting a lot lately. Apart from Ayanda s attempt to throw her over the bridge, there have been other shocking incidents. He has been beating her severely. Zama had a fresh injury on her head that she sustained from a recent beating, said the relative. The source said that even though the circumstances around the fights and the murder were not clear, they were linked to the fact that Zama wanted to end the relationship. Her boyfriend was jealous and abusive and their fights have been going on for a couple of months. It is not clear how long the two have been dating because neither of them is from the area. They came to the area early this year. Zama worked in Jozini and her boyfriend constantly visited her, said the source.It seems Zama separated from the father of her children a year ago.A friend who lives in the neighbourhood said after hearing the gunshots, they rushed to the scene. We found their bodies lying on the floor, bleeding profusely. KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane confirmed the incident.He said a case of murder and an inquest docket were opened at Jozini Police Station for investigation. Circumstances around the incident are still being investigated, said Zwane.
