When I heard the rumours I rushed to the school to fetch my child,” she said.Another parent, Karabo Masinga, said she decided to take leave from work to ensure the safety of her kids.“If I had the means, I would home-school my children.” Karabo said until the cops confirm or disprove the rumours, she will not risk with her kids’ lives.“We cannot just sit around and wait for our kids to be kidnapped. “We will do everything in our power to protect them.” Winterveld police spokesman Captain Samuel Sebola said the rumours were not true.“We do not have any cases of kidnapped or missing kids,” he said.“We have asked teachers to send letters to parents, especially those at home, to accompany their kids to and from school every day.”
