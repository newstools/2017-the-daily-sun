THE magoshas&rsquo; spot next to the busy road is popular with men who buy sex.&nbsp; But it appears that greedy cops are turning the spot into their own cash cow! Simphiwe Dlomo told Daily Sun the cops allegedly robbed him of his cash as he was about to pay for a taste of punani! The 30-year-old said the police dropped by unexpectedly and demanded that he handed over the cash or face arrest. &ldquo;I had no choice but to follow orders,&rdquo; said Simphiwe. &ldquo;I watched helplessly as the evil cops drove off with my last R100, leaving me horny and broke!&rdquo; Simphiwe said there was no way that he could ask for sex without paying. Daily Sun found Simphiwe yesterday at the spot near the old Heidelberg Road, stranded, with no money to get home. In the end, a good-hearted magosha searched her bag and gave Simphiwe some money to get home. He said he lived in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni, and works at a nearby farm. The magoshas said they are constantly being harassed by cops. &ldquo;They harass our customers and take their money.&nbsp; &ldquo;The men often choose to suffer in silence because if they lay a charge, their partners will know their secret,&rdquo; said one of the magoshas.&nbsp; &ldquo;The cops tell us that what we&rsquo;re doing is illegal but we are not selling their bodies, and we don&rsquo;t rob people like they do! They should just leave us in peace.&rdquo; - Ekurhuleni East cop spokesman Sergeant Mashudu Phathela advised them to approach the Dawn Park police spokesman directly with any information.
