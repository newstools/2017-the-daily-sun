IT IS make or break for Mzansi&rsquo;s three clubs in African competitions this weekend! Platinum Stars and SuperSport United are away in their respective crucial penultimate Caf Confederation Cup group matches.In the bigger league, defending African champions Mamelodi Sundowns have undertaken a tough trip to Ethiopia where they face surprise package Saint George in Addis Ababa tomorrow (3.30pm).In the Confed Cup SuperSport United, boosted by their thrilling 4-1 demolition of Orlando Pirates in last weekend&rsquo;s Nedbank Cup final played in Durban, are in Guinea to play local champions and Group D leaders Horoya AC at the Stade 28 Septembre in Conakry tomorrow (5pm).It is a must-win game for Matsatsantsa a Pitori, who are tied on six points with defending champions TP Mazembe of the DR Congo, while Horoya have eight points. Mazembe play bottom club CF Mounana in Gabon on Sunday. Mounana have zero points and have nothing to play for. The DR Congo giants are expected to win, which puts pressure on United who are unbeaten in their five Confed Cup away matches played so far.But players like Reneilwe Letsholonyane, Thuso Phala and Grant Kekana have been key for the United side.Dikwena are hanging on for dear life and must beat Group B leaders MC Alger in Algiers, Algeria, tonight (10pm) to stand any chance of advancing to the quarterfinals.In the Champions League, Sundowns face their moment of truth in what has been a tough Group C, where Tunisia giants Esperance head the table with eight points, followed by Downs and Saint George, both on five points.Downs have suffered an avalanche of injuries recently &ndash; as many as eight players missed the 2-1 home loss to Esperance.But Pitso Mosimane&rsquo;s men have regrouped and had three key players, skipper Hlompho Kekana and strikers Anthony Laffor and Yannick Zakri, back from injury in the 0-0 draw played in Tunis recently.Laffor will be key, as will the mercurial Percy Tau, who had left his shooting boots at home in the 0-0 draw with Esperance.Downs have not had a break in two years. They have played non-stop in the Champions League and Cup, the Fifa World Cup last December and in all the domestic competitions since August 2015.Said Mosimane: &ldquo;The fact is the programmes of the domestic league and Champions League overlap. We lost the Absa Premiership this season when we had to catch up six games after playing in the Champions League. &ldquo;The same happened to Zenaco in Zambia and Zamalek in Egypt. It would be easier if local leagues were run from January to November.&rdquo;
