MAMA Winnie has had enough of the current ANC. Speaking to the Huffington Post SA, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela said only a fool could turn a blind eye to the problems and challenges facing the movement.While she said she did not recognise the ANC any more, she also conveyed a message of hope, saying she and other remaining leaders would restore it to its former glory.&ldquo;Not even a fool can pretend that we do not have problems.&ldquo;We have very serious problems,&rdquo; she told the online publication.She said the ANC is bleeding.&ldquo;We are in trouble.&rdquo; She added that hopefully after the bleeding has stopped the organisation will bounce back. She said the corruption in the ruling party was not part of the ANC she gave her life for.&ldquo;The ANC of our forebears has disappeared. Every day you open a newspaper, there are stories about this corruption and capture of the state.&ldquo;The ANC is also captured.&rdquo;She said this was what happened to revolutionary movements and she had warned about that 23 years ago. She said she had warned the party&rsquo;s leadership at the Codesa negotiating table in the 1990s that things were going wrong then.She said she had imagined an ANC and a South Africa that was led by Chris Hani, who was assassinated on the eve of the new era.Madikizela-Mandela said those who loved the organisation should not give up hope just yet.&ldquo;We are aware of the grave challenges today. I wish to give South Africans a message of encouragement, and tell them not all is lost,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;Us remnants left of the original African National Congress that we will be able to restore it to its former dignity, to its former glory.&rdquo;
