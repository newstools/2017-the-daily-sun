THE WAY young people drink and dance over the blood of those who died is an insult to the youth of 1976. June 16 is about those who gave their lives for a better future, said Seth Mazibuko, a 15-year-old student leader on that historic day. JUNE 16 IS ABOUT FREEDOM. IT IS NOT ABOUT SHEBEENS, HE SAID.The youngest member of the Student Action Committee, Seth Mazibuko, was arrested in July 1976 at the age of 16.He was held in solitary confinement for 11 months at the Fort Prison in Braamfontein, Joburg before being charged, tried, and sent to Robben Island for seven years.Speaking to&nbsp;Daily Sun&nbsp;from his house in Soweto, he said he was head boy at Orlando West Junior Secondary.&ldquo;Pupils put me in a leadership role. That&rsquo;s why I was on the committee at the age of 15,&rdquo; said Seth.He said the day of the uprising was very traumatic because he was so young.&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I regret about that day, it&rsquo;s that I led pupils out of the classroom into people who attacked them with guns.&ldquo;We never planned on picking up even one stone.&ldquo;The only thing planned was peace,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;We knew there would be force to get us off the streets but what we never thought was the force would be guns and arrests.&rdquo;He said cops fired teargas and released dogs.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what started the war.&rdquo;Then matters escalated.Pupils started throwing stones and killing the dogs and stranded cops started firing live ammunition.According to Seth, bodies of pupils were scattered all over after the short moment of violence.Seth said June 16 is about commemoration, not about celebration.He said his birthday is on 17 June and he spends the eve of his birthday at the grave of student leader Tsietsi Mashinini.Seth believes today&rsquo;s education system is an insult to what they fought and died for.&ldquo;We are still a country that is not yet free.&ldquo;Our education is still as colonised as it was then.&ldquo;Our kids are not eating the fruits of our struggle,&rdquo; he said.
