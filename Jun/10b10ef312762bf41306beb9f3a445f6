ABOUT 1 000 kids attended the Twelve Apostle Church in Christ&rsquo;s Sunday School provincial choir competition.It was held at Bongolethu Primary School in Philippi, close to Cape Town last Saturday.Andile Yilo, the youth chairman, said it was not just about the competition but also about teaching kids how to behave.&ldquo;The competition aims to make them happy while showing off their talent, but the important thing is how they behave.&rdquo; He said it was important to mentor kids at Sunday School because then they understood rules, were disciplined and stood out from kids who didn&rsquo;t attend church. More than 14 choirs took part in the competition and the winners were from a Khayelitsha branch of the church. They won a trophy and R1 000. Delft came out in second place and won the same amount while Lower Crossroads came third and won a trophy. Salathiso Ngcoyiya (8) said he went to Sunday School because he loves music.Imange Caphu (9) said he enjoys attending Sunday School.&ldquo;We are taught how to behave, how to respect and how to communicate with others,&rdquo; he said. Zimasa Mthwa, a parent, said: &ldquo;This competition helps because it keeps kids at church.&ldquo;They learn that they don&rsquo;t need to be on the streets to have fun, but can find enjoyment in church too.&rdquo;Zolile Ndevu, chairman of the event, said it had been organised with the kids in mind.&ldquo;When kids are together they are happy. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they know each other or not. Through music they learn how to behave, listen and respect.&rdquo;
