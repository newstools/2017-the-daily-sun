A COUNCILLOR handed himself over to the cops on Monday in connection with an attempted murder case. The councillor allegedly assaulted two men who had asked for directions from him and fired shots in the air. One of them was hit by a bullet! The councillor was arrested by cops in Mariannhill and is expected to appear in the Pinetown Magistrates Court soon. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: &ldquo;He responded to a message left by the cops and handed himself over.&rdquo; During the alleged incident at the councillor&rsquo;s home in Dassenhoek, west of Durban, two weeks ago, a 23-year-old man was shot in the back and the bullet came out through his chest. The wounded man told Daily Sun he and a friend had gone to the councillor&rsquo;s house to ask for directions. &ldquo;The councillor kicked us as he suspected we had been sent by someone to harm him,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;When he was tired of kicking us, he let us go and fired shots in the air.&rdquo; The man said after he had run out of the councillor&rsquo;s yard, he realised he was bleeding from the chest. &ldquo;I was rushed to hospital and the councillor has since been coming to my house to offer me R20 000 in compensation. He wants the charges dropped,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Although he has not personally made threats, my family has heard from people close to him that he may kill us if I refuse the bribe.&rdquo; Colonel Mbhele advised the man to report threats, if any, to the investigating officer. Princess Nkabane, eThekwini Municipality spokeswoman, said they could not comment on a criminal matter.
