Anti-Tobacco month has ended but the reasons for quitting smoking will always be relevant.&nbsp; The Independent Community Pharmacy Association, through its Pharmacists Against Tobacco campaign encourages smokers to quit this deadly habit.&nbsp; Jackie Maimin, acting CEO of the pharmacy association, said smokers taking the first step to quitting must not get overwhelmed at the idea of never smoking again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going smoke-free for 24 hours is an achievement and often gives the smoker the confidence to continue for another 24 hours. By not smoking one day at a time the ultimate goal of becoming an ex-smoker becomes achievable. Smokers can visit their local community pharmacies to get advice and help to get them through those first few hours, days or weeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why you should quit smoking&nbsp; Cigarettes contain arsenic, formaldehyde, lead, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia and 43 known carcinogens.&nbsp; Nearly eight out of 10 deaths by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema are as a result of smoking. There is no cure for emphysema.&nbsp; The chance that a lifelong smoker will die prematurely from a complication caused by smoking is about 50%.&nbsp; In South Africa, cigarette smoking ranks the third highest risk of death &ndash; about 44&thinsp;000 deaths every year.&nbsp; Smoking harms nearly every organ and organ system in the body and reduces a person&rsquo;s overall health.&nbsp; Exposure to secondhand smoke slows a child&rsquo;s lung growth.
