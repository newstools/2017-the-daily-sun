THE alliance of the ANC, Cosatu and SACP is not working. It needs a facelift to be sustained. SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande said this at a Nehawu national conference yesterday. He said the SACP and Cosatu were feeling abused as alliance partners.Nzimande said the alliance needed to be reconfigured and to have conditions attached.&ldquo;If we are in an alliance we must work together. We must consult each other on key positions. We are in alliance with the ANC, not a faction. We are in alliance with the ANC, not the Guptas or parasitic networks,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;And then there are those who say we are begging for positions. We are not begging for positions, we are serving our people. Of course we have interest in those positions because they wield state power and we have an interest in that,&rdquo; he said.Nzimande lambasted Gupta defenders who say the family&rsquo;s critics do not attack &ldquo;white monopoly capital&rdquo; but instead single out the Guptas. He said it could not be that they had fought apartheid and defeated it only to hand state resources over to the Guptas. He labelled the family as &ldquo;looters who are worse than white monopoly capital&rdquo;.The SACP was opposed to any form of capital, regardless of what colour or form.
