She said that last week a five-year-old child was taken by a woman and after a few days the kid was found dead.She said her department was aware that some foreigners are involved in human trafficking, and the killing of young women and kids in the country. &ldquo;But they are not the only ones. This affects our department as we are the first ones to answer and we are also trying to find a solution to this matter. For now, South Africans must bring back ubuntu, where my child is your child and your child is mine.&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hold hands and work together as mothers to make South Africa a better place,&rdquo; she said.Linda Futuse (52), deputy president of the association, said the killings are caused by Satanism. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for God to intervene.
