PHINDILE Cele believes her dad&rsquo;s spirit would not have rested peacefully anywhere else . . . He was killed in a fire four years ago, but the mortuary only released Mfaniseni Cele&rsquo;s body recently!Daily Sun published her story, headlined &ldquo;Phindile needs her father&rsquo;s body&rdquo;, on 17 May. The 34-year-old woman had tried almost everything to get the remains, with no luck.Last Sunday, Phindile from Ngonweni Village in Ndwedwe, KZN, finally gave her dad a dignified sendoff. Mfaniseni Cele died after a house he was guarding in Avoca, north of Durban, caught fire in 2013. He was 52 at the time. The police had kept his body in the government mortuary in Phoenix. This was after they had told his family they would perform a DNA test on him to determine his identity. Since then, Phindile had been fighting to get the results, or to at least be given her dad&rsquo;s remains. The mere fact that his remains were kept in the mortuary for so many years, she said, proved his spirit refused to be buried anywhere else.&ldquo;The reason I say this is that a mortuary worker told me he was surprised my dad was left out in a government plan for burials of unclaimed bodies,&rdquo; she told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;The worker said the mortuary only kept bodies for a specific number of months. If the remains were unclaimed, the burial rights were given to the government. &ldquo;I think his spirit could feel that we were worried, and that we wanted him to be buried at home.&rdquo; The family was relieved that her dad got a proper burial. &ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s painful, we&rsquo;re relieved that we now know where he lies buried,&rdquo; she said. Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: &ldquo;The DNA results confirmed that the dead man was Phindile&rsquo;s dad. The identification statement was obtained from the relative, and the body was released to the next of kin.&rdquo;
