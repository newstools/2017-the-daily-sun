NEHAWU&rsquo;s Parliament branch wants Parliament secretary Gengezi Mgidlana to be suspended by the end of the week while a probe into his conduct takes place, or they will remove him. National Health, Education and Allied Workers&rsquo; Union (Nehawu) members in Parliament pleaded with presiding officers Baleka Mbete and Thandi Modise to allow an internal audit into allegations against Mgidlana to be free of potential interference. "We are saying no to special leave. Mgidlana should be suspended, no special preferential treatment. We are sick and tired," branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe said earlier today. "If they fail to do that, it should be our responsibility to go to our office and remove him, or prevent him from entering the office." Members present vigorously applauded the call. An internal parliamentary audit is currently under way looking into allegations that Mgidlana had irregularly, among other things, hired management staff, awarded himself an education bursary and embarked on "wasteful" overseas trips. The call also comes in the middle of pay negotiations between Parliament and the union after it was announced Parliament workers will receive a 0% salary increase this financial year. On Sunday Mgidlana denied the allegations, saying no shred of evidence had been produced to back them up. "Central to the union's malicious allegations is a claim that the current financial difficulty is caused by financial mismanagement and/or corruption. This is a deliberately misleading, baseless and unnecessary propagation of untruths," he said. Tembe accused Mgidlana of negotiating in bad faith. Newahu approached the Public Protector last year over the allegations. It says it will call on Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane to escalate the investigation and that it will be submitting more evidence of Mgidlana's alleged misconduct.
