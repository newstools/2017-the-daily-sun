A NUMBER of families have finally found peace as their loved ones&rsquo; remains have been moved from sinking, waterlogged graves to the municipal cemetery. Last year when Daily Sun published an article about the flooding, the families said whenever it rained, remains would float up and tombstones sank. The families from Ventersdorp, North West, then took their fight to the provincial government, the municipality and the Commission for the Protection of Cultural and Religious Communities. After the commission intervened, Ventersdorp Municipality agreed to move the remains at the council&rsquo;s cost. The commitment was confirmed after the Tlokwe and Ventersdorp&rsquo;s municipalities merged. Of the 48 affected graves, 28 have been moved and the families have signed relocation forms. When the families spoke to the SunTeam last year, the families said they felt they were not allowed to use the municipal cemetery because it was reserved for whites. They said they had been told the cemetery was full.Speaking on behalf of the family of Jacob Modise, who was the last person to be buried in a sinking grave, Elcan Tlhakanye said everyone was happy their loved ones would rest in peace. &ldquo;We are happy our people will be in peace, even though we feel we should have been allowed to perform traditional rituals for them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We think we might have the opportunity when the final big ceremony is held later in the year for the reburials.&rdquo; Mayoral spokesman Victor Boqo said the rest of the remains would be moved once families had given consent.
