WHEN neighbours told her the person who sold her dead mum an RDP in 2010 had put it up for sale again, Samkelisiwe Magwaza didn&rsquo;t believe them. But on Sunday, the 21-year-old from phase one in Quarry Heights, eThekwini, discovered the rumour was true when the seller arrived at the two-roomed house with a potential buyer! &ldquo;He told me I needed to start thinking of finding another place because he had found a buyer.&rdquo; Samkelisiwe told Daily Sun the seller arrived again on Monday and threatened her. &ldquo;He said we would see who was clever, him or me,&rdquo; she said. Samkelisiwe said the seller was able to do this because he had not given her mum the title deed when she bought the house for R55 000. &ldquo;He told my mum the title deed would only be transferred five years after purchase.&rdquo; Human Settlements spokesman Mbulelo Baloyi said RDP houses couldn&rsquo;t be sold in the first eight years after being handed over and title deeds were not immediately handed over to avoid instances like this. &ldquo;Samkelisiwe should go to the municipal human settlements department at Shell House and report the matter so they can investigate,&rdquo; he said.When the SunTeam phoned the seller, Joseph Nene, he said: &ldquo;Who are you and who gave you my number? I don&rsquo;t want to talk to strangers. All I want is my money.&rdquo; Samkelisiwe said she didn&rsquo;t have proof of payment but as far as she knew, her mum paid Joseph everything she owed on the house.
