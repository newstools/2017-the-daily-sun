DRIVING through Mzansi&rsquo;s potholed roads in dry weather is already a pain, but in wet weather it becomes really dangerous. But in this Ekurhuleni kasi, the roads have their own early warning system.Motorists said it&rsquo;s easy to spot which streets to avoid as soon as you see pothole puddles full of geese!&ldquo;In Duduza&rsquo;s streets when you see geese you must stop!&rdquo; a motorist turning off to avoid the road full of potholes shouted, as the SunTeam drove past.The geese seem to have found a good home on the kasi streets and have been seen in many areas testing the potholes full of water.Motorists have caught on quickly , realising that when they see the birds on the road, they need to be careful as there is sure to be hidden danger.The geese can be seen splashing and enjoying their swims from early morning till late in the afternoon, retiring from duty in the evening.Motorists in the kasi said they loved their early warning geese as they had become their guardian angels.Peter Ngubane (43) said he used the kasi roads every day and at one stage got a puncture after hitting a pothole.&ldquo;But that was before our guiding birds were here.&ldquo;Since then I have found my way around all these potholes, with their help of course. &ldquo;I now bring them food every time I return from work because they are our eyes on this dangerous road.&rdquo; Daily Sun managed to track down the owner of the geese, who said he loved his geese but they preferred to roam the streets instead of staying home.&ldquo;They love to swim and the potholes serve as their little dams. &ldquo;I cannot afford to keep them at home all the time because they need water and with us water is scarce.&ldquo;But they always come home in the evening.&rdquo; The City of Ekurhuleni said it is rolling out projects to rid the city&rsquo;s kasis of potholes and promised to maintain the roads in future.
