&ldquo;MY SISTER was a go-getter. She was studying tourism and wanted to travel the world, but her dreams were cut short.&rdquo; These were the words of Thato Mokgalabone, whose sister Moipone (20) was murdered in March, allegedly by her boyfriend. The devastated 27-year-old from Kaalfontein in Midrand told Daily Sun: &ldquo;The boyfriend was arrested, but now he&rsquo;s walking free.&rdquo; She said what bothered her most was that her family had been kept in the dark about progress in the case. &ldquo;When the incident happened, we tried to open a case,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But the police told us the State had already done that. Since then no one has told us anything.&rdquo; Thato said her mum had a heart attack when she heard that the boyfriend was out on bail. &ldquo;Moipone went to visit her boyfriend, and they had an argument. He allegedly stabbed and killed her,&rdquo; said Thato.Captain Kay Makhubele advised Thato to speak to the station commander. The man (25) accused of trying to kidnap a woman (22) in Diepkloof, Soweto, at the weekend has been released. Daily Sun published her story yesterday. Captain Mavela Masondo said: &ldquo;The suspect is out on R1 000 bail. He&rsquo;ll appear in court on the 22 June.&rdquo;
