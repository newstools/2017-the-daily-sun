IN 1999, Sunshine Primary School was hastily started in shacks wit h the expectation that soon a brand new school would be built.&nbsp; But 18 years later, that hope is no more than a dream.&nbsp; TO THIS DAY, THE SUN HAS NEVER SHONE ON THE SCHOOL.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is difficult to try and teach children in these conditions,&rdquo; said a teacher at the school in Mbazwana, Mhlabuyalingana, in northern KZN. &ldquo;Every season has its own discomfort. When it rains, the water gets into the shacks. When it&rsquo;s hot, the heat is unbearable. In winter the children have to deal with the freezing cold winds.&rdquo; The school currently has 465 pupils from grade R to grade six. &ldquo;Yet the pupils keep coming to school despite the situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are praying that one day we receive assistance from the department,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;This is heartbreaking,&rdquo; said parent Nokubonga Zondo (47). &ldquo;Government preaches that education is their priority, yet our kids are studying under these conditions. &ldquo;We really want our kids to learn and they are hungry for education but this is not fair on them.&rdquo; She said this was not the kind of the education they wanted for their kids but they had no choice. &ldquo;Other schools are far away and the kids would have to walk for more than two hours to get there.&rdquo;&nbsp; SGB member Lihle Mnguni said they wanted the department of education to intervene because the situation was really bad.&nbsp; &ldquo;Teachers have to put blankets in the windows to prevent the wind and rain reaching the pupils,&rdquo; said Mnguni.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the school has too many pupils. These small shacks house more than 75 pupils and that&rsquo;s not good at all.&rdquo; KZN Department of Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said they are aware of the situation as the SGB had made a submission to head office.&nbsp; &ldquo;The matter is receiving our attention and has been put on a prioritised list of schools that need urgent attention,&rdquo; said Mahlambi. When Daily Sun asked Mahlambi why it had taken so many years to fix the problem, he said there was a list of schools in the same condition and they couldn&rsquo;t focus on only one school. &ldquo;Building a school structure from scratch takes a long time. There is a lot of work we put in before the actual building begins. Even if we were to provide park home classrooms, that is a long process.&rdquo; Mahlambi said they can&rsquo;t say how many years it will take. On the Basic Education website, figures refer to what are called &ldquo;inappropriate structures&rdquo;.&nbsp; These are buildings such as Sunshine Primary. The numbers are listed by province and on the KZN listing, there is no entry. When Mahlambi was asked whether there were no &ldquo;inappropriate structures&rdquo; in the province, he said there were. &ldquo;You are telling me about one school. I know many others that have the same problem and are on the list for building.&rdquo;
