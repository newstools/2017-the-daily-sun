HUMAN Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela launched the Forest Village housing project on Wednesday.The multimillion rand project in Eersterivier, near Cape Town is expected to supply over 4 500 houses in the area. Madikizela said it wasn&rsquo;t easy when they started.&ldquo;We want to make sure we provide roofs for our people.&rdquo; He said he will prioritise the elderly. &ldquo;Older people are not just going to be part of the project. It is their project, as we want to make sure we take care of them,&rdquo; said Madikizela.The project should be completed by the end of next year. People from Driftsands, Faure, Fairdale, Mfuleni, Eersterivier, Malibu Village, the Conifers and Bernadine will benefit. &ldquo;No matter how many resources we have, we will never be able to build houses for everyone,&rdquo; said Madikizela.He went on to say residents must make sure they protect the equipment used when building the houses as they don&rsquo;t want any delays and warned that conflict between communities would only hold up the project. Councillor Anda Ntsondo said they&rsquo;re happy to work with residents. &ldquo;The relationship must continue because when we work together, development happens, so we must be honest partners.&rdquo; He urged people to be honest and report those who steal equipment. &ldquo;The list of houses is long and protests are making things difficult. If you don&rsquo;t like something, speak up, but please don&rsquo;t create problems where there are none. &ldquo;Communication must be strong,&rdquo; said Ntsondo.Provincial parliament member Nceba Hinana said they will cater for the elderly and people with disabilities first. &ldquo;Fragile people must be first priority and we need to make sure they are safe.&rdquo; Beneficiary Vellem Pietersen (69) said he is relieved. &ldquo;I am tired of worrying every time it rains, and fearing shack fires.&rdquo;
