ESKOM kept pumping millions of rands into the Guptas&rsquo; business breakfasts, even though it could not afford it. The latest leaked emails show that shortly after the appointment of Collin Matjila as acting CEO of Eskom in 2014, the Gupta family&rsquo;s deals with the company took an upward turn.AmaBungane reports the emails show the family received Matjila&rsquo;s CV shortly before he was appointed to the position. After his appointment, Gupta-owned TNA Media scored deals with Eskom to sponsor the breakfasts.The business breakfasts, which have reportedly been cancelled by the SABC, were regularly broadcast live on the state broadcaster. According to the emails, on 22 March 2014, Gupta associate Salim Essa forwarded Matjila&rsquo;s CV to Tony Gupta and Atul Gupta&rsquo;s son, Srikant Singhala.The amaBhungane report from later in 2014 said a new contract for R43 million, allegedly approved by Matjila, committed Eskom to sponsoring one monthly briefing for three years at R14,4 million a year.The final contract allegedly did not allow Eskom to terminate the agreement &ndash; something Eskom&rsquo;s lawyers allegedly raised with Matjila.The board&rsquo;s audit and risk subcommittee even raised the alarm with Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.At about the same time, Eskom also entered into a contract for the bulk buying of The New Age.
