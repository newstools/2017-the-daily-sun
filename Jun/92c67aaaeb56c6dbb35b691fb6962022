THREE weeks ago, the residents of Kei Road, near King William&rsquo;s Town closed roads with rocks, burning tyres and tree branches. They demanded services from the government, saying they were gatvol after years of empty promises. The protests were put on hold after the government promised to develop the area. On Monday, community leaders met officials from various departments to come up with a solution.Community leader Albert Witbooi told Daily Sun they are happy they had a meeting with officials from different departments. &ldquo;Our mayor promised to work with us hand in hand,&rdquo; he said.Councillor Xola Nqatha said Amahlathi Municipality had budgeted R2,7 million for roads in the 2017/18 financial year and Amathole Municipality had budgeted R2,2 million for sewage and water.During the protest, the residents complained that a number of squatter camps established long after their township had proper houses, water, sanitation and electricity, while they remained forgotten. Albert said then: &ldquo;Our grandparents lived in these bad conditions and nothing has changed for the generations after them. In 1996, the government promised to build RDP houses in the area but nothing happened. &ldquo;There are more than 700 households that need houses.&rdquo;
