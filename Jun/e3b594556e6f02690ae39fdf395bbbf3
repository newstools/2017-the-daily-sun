RESIDENTS are gatvol of boozers who have turned a footpath near their houses into a bonking spot, after partying at a nearby tavern. Residents of J section in KwaMashu, north of Durban, told Daily Sun every weekend they were woken in the middle of the night by the sounds of screaming drunkards poking. They said they want their councillor to have the footpath, which is overgrown with grass and trees, cleared and to have street lights installed to stop the boozers from disturbing their sleep. Thoko Mgobhozi (57), who lives near the path, said the trouble started a year ago. &ldquo;When I began hearing people screaming outside at night I was scared until I realised they were having sex. &ldquo;These people are disrespectful.&rdquo; Fuming Thoko said on weekend mornings she often finds used condoms behind one of the shacks in her yard. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of these drunkards. The only time they don&rsquo;t come here is when it&rsquo;s raining. The footpath is dirty and smelly. I don&rsquo;t understand how they can enjoy sex there.&rdquo; Another resident, Mimi Mdlalose (28), said other footpaths in the area were turned into proper passages with street lights in 2007. &ldquo;This path was left out and no one knows why. Now it&rsquo;s turning into a bonking spot. &ldquo;We live with our parents and what these drunkards do is disgusting.&rdquo; Councillor Muziwenhlanhla Shezi said: &ldquo;Residents have been hired to clean the footpath. &ldquo;Right now they&rsquo;re just waiting for tools.&rdquo;
