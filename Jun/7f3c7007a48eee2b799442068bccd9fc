ON 10 October 2015, Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s son Duduzane received a temporary residence permit to live in the United Arab Emirates.The #GuptaLeaks emails reported in Daily Maverick that permission was issued a few months before two letters seemingly drafted on behalf of the president passed between Tony Gupta, Sahara CEO Ashu Chawla and Duduzane Zuma.Duduzane&rsquo;s profession on the permit is listed as investor and his sponsor is Lion Gate Electronics Trading. Leaked emails also showed that in December 2015 he bought an R18 million apartment in Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, through Wens Holdings Limited that he co-owned with the Gupta family, registered in Dubai.Yesterday, Daily Sun&rsquo;s sister publication City Press published a story about Duduzane&rsquo;s sexy emails. Several emails intended for Duduzane were sent to President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s account in 2015.According to the mails on 3 March 2015, two months before his wedding, Duduzane received four emails from former freelance stylist Malikah Hajee. One is titled &ldquo;Remember what you are missing!&rdquo;Frenchwoman Nadege dos Reis sent him selfies on 30 and 31 October 2015, five months after his wedding. In an email titled, &ldquo;That makes u flight to paris?&rdquo; she attaches a picture of herself in a sexy pink minidress and another of her wearing sexy underwear while lying on a bed.Emails sent to Duduzane about his residence permit, and questions for Gupta family spokesman Gary Naidoo, to whom City Press spoke telephonically, were unanswered at the time of going to print.
