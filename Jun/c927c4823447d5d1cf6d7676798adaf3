SIX raging fires forced over 200 people to flee their homes yesterday. The fires started on the mountain at Thornhill in Kouga Municipality, Eastern Cape, on Wednesday afternoon and spread quickly due to strong winds. Desperate farm residents had to be evacuated and given shelter at Thornhill Community Hall. Nolan Beaton (62), who lives with his family on Longmore Farm, said he realised something was wrong when his dog, Volley started barking and banging on the house door. &ldquo;It was about 9pm on Wednesday night. My wife, Layla (52) looked out through the window. When we all went out onto the stoep we saw the raging fires on the mountain. &ldquo;The fire was really fierce and we could see it coming towards our homes. We ran out of the house and hit the road.&rdquo; Another resident, Sindiswa Mabethe (59) and her husband, Nyansile (54) first saw the fire at about 3pm on Wednesday. &ldquo;It spread to our farm and burned the bush behind our house. We were rescued by the police who took us to the hall.&rdquo; Couga mayor Elza van Lingen thanked everyone who assisted the affected families. &ldquo;Currently we need people to donate milk, bread, water, mattresses, eye drops and refreshments. &ldquo;Luckily the fire at Orange Growth, which was threatening farms between Humansdorp and Oyster Bay, was put out,&rdquo; she said.
