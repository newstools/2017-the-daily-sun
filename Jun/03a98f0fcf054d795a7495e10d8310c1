COLD winter days call for warm slap chips, so there is rising demand for fresh potatoes. A truck driver and his two thug friends saw the gap in the market and thought they&rsquo;d make a clean sweep selling his employer&rsquo;s potatoes. But now they&rsquo;re in hot water after cops arrested the driver for perjury and bust the others as they were busy selling their loot. Police said the driver of the truckload of potatoes was supposed to deliver them to restaurants. But he and his two friends allegedly faked a hijacking and offloaded the contents of the truck, which they sold themselves. Their potato plan went bad when the driver was arrested. Captain Xoli Mbele of Joburg Central cop shop said the truck driver went to Mondeor police to open a case last Friday . . . But he was arrested the next day! Mbele said: &ldquo;He told police that two suspects had hijacked the white truck, which was full of potatoes, at Southgate Mall. &ldquo;The 32-year-old driver said he was with two of his co-workers, offloading bags of potatoes at the time.&rdquo; Mbele said police investigations had proved that the driver was, in fact, the perpetrator. &ldquo;Preliminary investigations revealed that the driver had conversations with the suspects (his two friends), who had both been arrested for truck hijacking before the incident occurred, and one of them was an ex-employee of the same company,&rdquo; said Mbele. The driver was arrested on a charge of perjury by Joburg Central police. &ldquo;The truck was recovered as his accomplices were busy offloading the potatoes. People were already queueing to buy,&rdquo; said Mbele. The suspects will appear in the Joburg Magistrates Court soon.
