THE gogos and madalas are tired of being ignored. Now they want the department of housing to act. Over 200 senior citizens from Mofolo, Soweto, marched in Joburg to the department&rsquo;s offices on Friday to protest about the RDP houses they are still waiting for.March leader Gertrude Hlekelele (51) said the old and the disabled have been ignored for far too many years. &ldquo;Most of us registered for the RDPs in 1996, and we are still waiting.&ldquo;Some people have died in shacks still holding their forms,&rdquo; she said.Gertrude said they were bringing their C-forms to the department with their cellphone numbers attached. &ldquo;We want the housing officials to call us and tell us when we are getting our houses,&rdquo; said Gertrude.Faniwell Mabila (53) said government needs to live up to its housing promises.&ldquo;Whenever we go to the department, they tell us to wait. The question is until when?&rdquo; he asked.Gogo Sonto Mohapi (76) said she was once informed that her house was ready, but when she got there someone else had moved in!&ldquo;They said they had bought the house and it was in their name. &ldquo;They showed me a title deed to prove me wrong.&rdquo;Sonto said the department now tells her she already has a house. Officials who received the memorandum on the day said they were not allowed to speak to the media. However, they promised to take the grievances to the office of Gauteng Human Settlements MEC, Paul Mashatile.
