It is a product of the Tshepo 500 000 initiative launched in 2014. The project provides opportunities to unemployed youth through skills training, job placement and business development. Moses said the company was committed to launching an online training and computer research programme and to develop internships for young people without matric. Gauteng Premier David Makhura was accompanied by MECs and private sector representatives. He said Gauteng’s youth had reason to be hopeful again. He said the provincial government had decided to double its target of empowering 500 000 youths by 2019.“The youth are the most vulnerable in society. They are used, exploited and are at the bleeding edge of high unemployment, poverty and growing inequality,” he said.
