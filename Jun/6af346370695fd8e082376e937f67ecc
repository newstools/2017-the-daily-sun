PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s wife Thobeka Madiba-Zuma has denied any knowledge of threats from Absa to close her bank account. Yesterday The Sunday Times reported that the bank had sent her a letter wanting an explanation for millions of rands which were passing through her account. According to the newspaper, the letter was sent to Madiba-Zuma earlier this year. An insider claimed that her account was flagged as large amounts of money were passing through it irregularly. When the newspaper approached Madiba-Zuma, she said her privacy was being invaded. &ldquo;I have no knowledge of Absa&rsquo;s intention to close my account. I have not received anything that has been communicated to me,&rdquo; she told the paper.Absa spokesman Songezo Zibi said he could not comment as clients&rsquo; information was confidential. Madiba-Zuma heads a foundation and is a shareholder in a property company and two investment companies. The newspaper reported it was not clear whether the payments were from these companies. A source told the newspaper: &ldquo;This is part of a routine check. If she doesn&rsquo;t provide the bank with the information it becomes suspicious.&rdquo; If the first lady fails to explain herself the bank will be forced to report the matter to the Financial Intelligence Centre. The leaked Gupta emails revealed Duduzane Zuma&rsquo;s accounts were closed a few months after banks closed the Guptas&rsquo; accounts.
