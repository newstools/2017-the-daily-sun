HER family wanted to wait before telling the 13-year-old she was HIV-positive . . . But she was allegedly informed by strangers of her status!On Friday, workers from non-profit organisation Exodus Foundation Ministries allegedly tested her in the street in front of her schoolmates.The girl&rsquo;s 33-year-old mum from Malukazi near Isipingo, KZN, told Daily Sun she wanted the organisation to pay for the emotional damage caused. &ldquo;My daughter has been crying since the incident. She doesn&rsquo;t want to go to school. She fears what her friends might do if she goes back to the same school.&rdquo;The mum told the People&rsquo;s Paper she was called to the scene by a neighbour, who found out about her daughter&rsquo;s nightmare. &ldquo;She told me the testers told her my daughter was HIV-positive after she enquired about a strip with two lines she saw lying on the ground,&rdquo; said the mum.She said when she found her daughter, the shaking girl was holding the paper that had the results. &ldquo;I asked why they tested the kids in an open area, but they did not give me a proper answer,&rdquo; she said.The organisation&rsquo;s director, Zandile Mthembu, said they tried approaching the parents, but they were very angry. &ldquo;They want us to pay,&rdquo; said Mthembu. &ldquo;They threatened us with their lawyers. We will wait for their lawyers.&rdquo;KZN Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo said the department would assist the family with counselling and by tracking down the organisation.&ldquo;What they did was wrong,&rdquo; Dhlomo told Daily Sun. &ldquo;Our professionals know that testing people against their will is illegal.&ldquo;HIV testing is always done in a respectable manner to protect the patient&rsquo;s dignity.&rdquo;
