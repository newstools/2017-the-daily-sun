CORRUPT cops in KZN must know their days are numbered.Acting provincial commissioner, Major-General Bheki Langa, said eight cops were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly taking bribes. He said the cops from the Golela border post near Pongola, northern KZN, were bust after an eight-month investigation. The cops allegedly asked for bribes to assist the movement of illegal cars and goods across the border into Swaziland. The eight, aged between 30 and 43, are facing charges of corruption, extortion, defeating the ends of justice, forgery and uttering. They are expected to appear in the Pongola Magistrates Court soon. Langa said corruption in the SAPS would not be tolerated. &ldquo;This is by no means our last operation of this nature. We once again call on communities to bring corrupt activities to our attention.&rdquo; Provincial police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane, said officers from the counter-crime intelligence division and detectives had conducted an intensive investigation at the Golela border.
