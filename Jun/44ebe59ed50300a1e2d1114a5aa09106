MARITZBURG United&rsquo;s new head coach Fadlu Davids has been given a tough assignment by boss Farook Kadodia.&nbsp;The Team of Choice chairman has said he wants to see his club be competitive next season and, more importantly, finish in the top five and play in at least one cup final.Kadodia officially unveiled Davids as the club&rsquo;s new head coach yesterday. He takes over a position vacated by Roger De Sa in March after a short spell in charge.&nbsp;Kadodia said he was certain that Davids would achieve that mandate: &ldquo;The players are used to him and that was evident whenever he was called on to assist in the past season. He was always there for the team when we lost our coaches.&nbsp;&ldquo;He did well and the players seem to understand him very well. That is why I&rsquo;m positive that the top five finish will be achievable, together with at least one cup final appearance. "I&rsquo;m fully behind him in all aspects.&rdquo;The appointment of Davids, who was given a two-year contract with a one-year option, didn&rsquo;t come as a shock to many. He helped the Team of Choice finish in seventh position last season, the best finish they have ever achieved in the Premier Soccer League era.&nbsp;In 14 matches in charge he won six, drew six and lost two. With this track record at United, Davids is also convinced that the mandate he has been given is achievable.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;We have to start now and change our mind set. In the next three years we need to get Maritzburg into the top eight on a consistent basis.That is the next target.&nbsp;&ldquo;Once we achieve that, we can look at the bigger picture.&rdquo;Davids thanked mentor Ernst Middendorp for the opportunity to be his assistant: &ldquo;I knew it would happen but didn&rsquo;t want to rush it. Ernst told me to give myself time.&nbsp;&ldquo;I had a five-year plan to study hard and get the necessary experience. I&rsquo;m glad it worked out the way I planned. I had offers before to be head coach but turned them down because I felt I wasn&rsquo;t ready. Now I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; said Davids, who will be assisted by his brother Mahier.&nbsp;
