SUPERSPORT United&rsquo;s Thabo Mnyamane is afraid of a backlash from a wounded Orlando Pirates who are desperate to conclude the 2016-17 PSL season with a trophy in their cabinet.United will share the field for 90 minutes or more with Bucs when they clash in the Nedbank Cup final at Durban&rsquo;s Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday (8.15pm).Pirates have nothing to lose and much to gain if they win the Ke Yona cup, which comes with a hefty R6 million in prize money for the champions.Mnyamane said they were aware Bucs had nothing to show for the season, which makes them very dangerous, as they will be out to bag some silverware to make up for a disastrous run. The 24-year-old left-wing reckons SuperSport are under no pressure to retain their Nedbank Cup title, which they won against the same Pirates last year. This is the only trophy left on offer for Bucs coach Kjell Jonevret to regain the confidence of chairman Irvin Khoza after missing out on a top eight spot and all other chances at silverware.Said Mnyamane: &ldquo;It would be great to be the first team to retain the Nedbank Cup trophy. It would mean a lot for my career too. &ldquo;But Saturday&rsquo;s final won&rsquo;t be an easy game against Pirates and we still owe them one, I believe. We are also trying to get some silverware. &ldquo;We were unlucky not to win the Telkom Knockout and we were unlucky in the league too. This is a great opportunity to win silverware.&rdquo;The former AmaTuks player said he still harboured hope of lifting the Premiership trophy in future. &ldquo;I am looking forward to it,&rdquo; he said, adding that winning the Nedbank Cup would be a good send-off for outgoing coach Stuart Baxter.&ldquo;We need to stick to the game plan, execute it well and come out victorious. We need to deliver. We can&rsquo;t step on the field thinking of what happened a year ago,&rdquo; he added.
