POLICE say the owner of the car that was allegedly used in the murder of Eskom employee Thembisile Yende has died after being questioned. Captain Johannes Ramphora said police are investigating whether Yende was murdered elsewhere and her body dumped at the Eskom substation in Springs, where she worked.Ramphora said the man owned the white BMW allegedly used in the crime.&ldquo;We suspect that he was a friend of (David) Ngwenya and that they used the BMW to commit the murder. He died of natural causes,&rdquo; Ramphora said.Ramphora could not confirm whether Ngwenya was also an Eskom employee.Ngwenya appeared in court on Monday charged with premeditated murder.The 43-year-old was arrested in Carletonville last Thursday.The 29-year-old Yende&rsquo;s body was found in her office after Eskom workers noticed a bad smell. She was reported missing on May 17. She had worked for Eskom since December 2015.A post mortem showed that she had sustained head injuries and she had bruises on her neck inflicted before she died.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa&rsquo;s (Numsa&rsquo;s) Phakamile Hlubi said they conducted a computer search under the name of David Ngwenya and found that there was an Ngwenya employed by Eskom.&ldquo;We are not confirming that he was an employee of Eskom. We are saying if it is the same David Ngwenya who was arrested, then he is a senior supervisor at Eskom. But Eskom needs to confirm that,&rdquo; Hlubi said.Hlubi said Ngwenya was not a member of Numsa.Eskom national spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said the matter was in the hands of the police and the courts.&ldquo;We are not going to say anything on the matter until police are done with their investigations,&rdquo; Phasiwe said.Captain Johannes Raphora said, however, that detectives did not have a chance to question the second man as he was already dead when they arrested the 43-year-old man in the same area of Carltonville last week.
