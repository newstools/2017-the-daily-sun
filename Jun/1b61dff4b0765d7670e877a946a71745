They then searched my husband as he lay on the floor.&rdquo;&ldquo;They found R9 000 on him. Then the intruders started arguing over who would finish him off. I heard Abel screaming. Then they shot him.&rdquo; After the thugs left, Reginalda ran to the neighbours for help and they took wounded Abel to hospital.&ldquo;As we were leaving, we noticed our security guard had been shot in the chest and killed.&rdquo; Abel&rsquo;s brother, Vasco Mtimkulu (36) said the security guard was shot after refusing to give them money.&ldquo;I was in my house when they knocked on the door and asked for cash.
