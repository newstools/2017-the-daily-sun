ANGRY rubbish collectors claim that they used to make between R500 and R800 daily before Samwu workers went out on strike. They said the strike in the Mangaung municipality that lasted close to a month had affected them badly.Even though the strike ended on Monday, rubbish collectors at the local dump said there is no rubbish to recycle.The dumpsite is situated outside the township in Botshabelo, where at least 50 unemployed people gather daily to collect material for recycling. Rasekei Daemane (48) from Section C in Botshabelo has been collecting rubbish at the local dump for more than 10 years. After losing his construction job, he promised himself that he&rsquo;d work for himself. That&rsquo;s when he realised that recycling was a good way to make money. &ldquo;Recycling companies always came to the site to buy whatever they needed from us.&rdquo; But after striking workers stopped collecting rubbish in the kasi, they had nothing to sell.&ldquo;Who will employ me at my age? My son and my wife are suffering as there is no income. &ldquo;The strike ended but there is still nothing to collect. I wish workers could start collecting and dumping rubbish.&rdquo;Motsamai Sehao (27) and Tsepane Lipholo (28) said the reason they decided to turn the dump into their permanent job was because there was no other employment.They said even though there are people who disrespect their work, to them it&rsquo;s a comfort as they are able to make cash without committing crime. &ldquo;This dump is our only hope. Without rubbish, our lives would be very difficult.&rdquo; Mangaung Metro spokesman Qondile Khedama said the strike ended this week after the municipality and workers reached agreement.
