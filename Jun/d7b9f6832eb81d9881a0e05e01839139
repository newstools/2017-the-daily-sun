AFTER being involved in three promotion/relegation play-offs with no success, Black Leopards talisman, Siphelele Ntshangase, is now dying to return to the top league.&nbsp; This week, Leopards owner David Thidiela revealed he was interested in releasing the player and has invited Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs to come with offers for his talented captain.&nbsp; Ntshangase has been a loyal servant for close to four years and the club have turned down numerous offers from PSL teams over past seasons.&nbsp; But this year&rsquo;s play-offs seem to have been the last throw of the dice.&nbsp; The soft-spoken player said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long and tough journey for me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been part of the National First Division (NFD) for a long time, and now it&rsquo;s about time I faced other challenges. I&rsquo;m ready for new competition.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s about time I made the move, I&rsquo;m ready to join a PSL club.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t play in the NFD for the rest of my career. So far, I haven&rsquo;t received any official offers, but something will come up and time around I&rsquo;ll take it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go where my heart wants to be because I want game time wherever I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo;&nbsp; There shouldn&rsquo;t be shortage of offers for the former SA Under-23 star, but his departure to the PSL will depend on the club&rsquo;s agreement terms with the big boss, Thidiela.&nbsp; Ntshangase will most certainly not come cheap.&nbsp; The KwaZulu-Natal-born player is left with one year on his contract with Leopards.&nbsp; At the beginning of the season, Ntshangase did not get much game as he was still recovering from a knee injury.&nbsp; After recovering the talented midfielder has been present in the squad that managed to book a play-off spot by finishing second in the NFD.&nbsp; He was part of the team when they played and failed to get PSL promotion on three seasons: 2013/2014, 2014/2015 and 2016/2017.
