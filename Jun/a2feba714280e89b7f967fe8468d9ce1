According to Alfred, in areas like Hospital Park, residents had no electricity at all. &ldquo;We want the municipality to consider installing it,&rdquo; he said. Community members from Hospital Park told the SunTeam life was very difficult for them. &ldquo;Our lives are in danger because we have been forced to use illegal connections. We need proper electricity in our area,&rdquo; said one resident. Other protesters said they wanted the government to give them land permanently. Resident Cynthia Mahlangu (50) said: &ldquo;We are tired of renting.&rdquo; The protesters said they were giving the City of Joburg seven days to respond to their grievances or they would make the place ungovernable.Raymond Arends accepted the memorandum on behalf of the municipality and promised to hand it over to mayor Herman Mashaba. Meanwhile, in Savanna City in the Vaal, residents also protested for better service delivery. They complained they had no school, clinic or cop shop nearby. The residents told Daily Sun they had to travel over 20km to get medical treatment. They said they were tired of being overlooked and wanted services.
