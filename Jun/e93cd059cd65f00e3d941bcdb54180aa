BONGANI Khumalo&rsquo;s artistic hands can turn any rubbish into beautiful works of art. He sees any throwaway material as gold. For Bongani, money is not a major motivator. The fulfilment he gets from playing with old tyres, plastic and mat carpets, bottles and other throwaway material keeps him motivated.&ldquo;Art is a fulfilling profession,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I feel alive and whole when I am busy with my artwork.&rdquo;Bongani, who is from Emdeni in Soweto, specialises in visual art, sculpture, paintings, melted plastic, old car parts and recycled art.His love of art started at a very tender age, when he used to watch his dad doing art. He recalls how, while attending school in KwaZulu-Natal, he used to create cow and other figures in clay.He told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I discovered, working with clay as boys while herding cows, that I would feel a lovely sensation from creating. &ldquo;Later, when I moved back home in Soweto, I decided to enrol for an arts course at Funda Centre in Diepkloof. &ldquo;That is where I gained more knowledge of working with waste material. My dad was my greatest inspiration. &ldquo;I also advocate for industrial farming to grow vegetables and chickens. &ldquo;My chicken coops help to produce natural eggs. Let&rsquo;s promote organic farming, instead of buying everything from the shops.
