WHEN Johane Mhlongo looks at his girlfriend and kids, he sees complete strangers. The only thing he can remember is the day in December when he was supposed to receive a big bonus at work. The 43-year-old father of two from Mashekesheni, near Komatipoort in Mpumalanga, relies on friends and family to fill in his memories. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told I have a girlfriend and kids but I don&rsquo;t recognise them.&ldquo;They tell me how much I loved and adored them but I don&rsquo;t remember this. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember the friends who used to visit me either,&rdquo; he said. Johane told Daily Sun the one day he did remember was when he was very excited about receiving his bonus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told I collapsed before I received the money, probably because of the excitement.&ldquo;No one can tell me whether I received a cent of the money though. &ldquo;I was in hospital for three months and my kids fetched me when I was released,&rdquo; he said. Friends and relatives said they had to keep reminding Johane what his name and surname was. Johane said they kept telling him he may have been bewitched by his colleagues. &ldquo;People tell me to see a sangoma but I don&rsquo;t have the money to consult one. &ldquo;If God exists, he must give me my memory back,&rdquo; he said. His friend, Aaron Shabangu (39), said he believed Johane needed strong prayers to get his memories back.Dr Bob-John Masango said Johane could be suffering from a condition known as amnestic disorder, which is caused by brain cells dying. &ldquo;With rehabilitation and medication he can slowly regain his memory,&rdquo; he said. Sunnyboy Msiza, chairman of the Traditional Healers Association, claimed Johane might have witnessed something he shouldn&rsquo;t have, and a strong sangoma could help him with his problem.
