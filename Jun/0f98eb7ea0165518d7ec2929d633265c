TEBOHO Sello loves going out in expensive clothes and showing off his sense of style. However, this got him moered on Sunday night, when tavern patrons accused him of trying to advertise himself as a blesser to their girlfriends. Despite receiving a beating, the 24-year-old from Caleb Motshabi in Mangaung told Daily Sun no one would stop him from wearing clothes that made him feel good about himself. He said he loved his collection of Gucci, Polo, Diesel and Kurt Geiger clothes. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsupInc80Oa19z6CanQTLvksRxeNLjnQJDEuQvxrZCigriFjEPscmwatCATivB58zqxjHxIkcNgHE9PCL4XnixDgy7wrv_SeQg6euHvGLevec7LZQK26M8ZQ6LMnDW_JRKZOhpedcx2o5mjVhpXBkpMvYQMiTgPQTAkMrg6aJzxBo93tT_1PmkVcnSLvjxknopDxakJJ8a4nrdf6ETvu2EaR6KZFdA3FX2mcLhA2H-RFFWFwzwfy9tADeR6BUID7eBJTiw-puXzRCpDziufZ44WirzyozBc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzBNNt328CoXGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

He told me to leave as I was making other guys feel like I was chasing their women.” Teboho said he didn’t listen but ended up regretting this decision. “When I left the tavern a few hours later, four men followed me out. They asked me if I was enjoying their women and before I could turn around to answer, they tripped me and started beating me.” Teboho said he was dragged into the road by his feet after being assaulted with knobkerries. He didn’t open a case because he said he just wanted to forget about the assault. Pule Sebatsi (33), a tavern patron, said he didn’t support the beating but Teboho looked for trouble by bragging and saying he could have any woman he wanted.
