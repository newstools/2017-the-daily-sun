EFF leader JULIUS Malema is one of the loudest parliamentarians, but when at home he is a completely different person. "When I'm at home, I don't do those things of parliament, I don't want my home to become parliament or become any of the uncomfortable places." Malema was speaking during an interview with radio mogul, T'bo Touch on his digital radio station, Touch HD on Wednesday. &nbsp;He spoke about various issues including the #GuptaLeaks emails, his family and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula. "At home, I'm a husband and I subject myself to collective wisdom from the both of us." Malema said. He described his home as a peaceful place, especially after getting all the stress in parliament. Malema says when he's at home, he plays with the child and even rolls on the carpet with the child. Malema said Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula is doing a great job in the police ministry and needs a good police commissioner who is going to complement him. "I think that guy is doing a great job,&nbsp; he's taking criminals on."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that if a matter relating to crime is brought to Mbalula's attention he attends to it. About the Presidency's denial on #GuptaLeaks emails, Malema said they are not fabricated. "If these emails were not authentic, why is the president not opening a case against these people. "Why are they not being taken to court, if Dubai is a fabrication?" he asked. When asked if his name will be featured in the controversial emails, Malema said "I'm not in the emails, they (Guptas) have never called me, I've never met them." He said they have never even sent him a WhatsApp message.
