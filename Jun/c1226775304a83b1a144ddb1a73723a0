THE police said Matron Busisiwe Ndaba (57) from Ladysmith Hospital in the KZN Midlands was stabbed to death on Friday by a man who then ran away from home.KZN police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said: &ldquo;While he was fleeing, he was knocked down by a car and taken to hospital for treatment. &ldquo;He remained under police guard until he died in the early hours of Saturday.&rdquo; However, some people say that after Busisiwe was stabbed, the alleged knifeman, Sthembiso Hadebe (44) from Umkhamba Gardens in Ladysmith, threw himself in front of a moving car.&ldquo;When he realised he had killed her, he drank poison. The poison wasn&rsquo;t working fast enough so he went and threw himself at a moving car,&rdquo; said the source. Hadebe was allegedly angry that Busisiwe had failed to send him money on Thursday, which was her payday. &ldquo;When the matron arrived at the Ben 10&rsquo;s home in Umkhamba Gardens, he asked her why he hadn&rsquo;t received an SMS notifying him of a deposit. &ldquo;The matron gave him a reason and then he stabbed her,&rdquo; said the source. Zwane said Ladysmith police are investigating the incident.
