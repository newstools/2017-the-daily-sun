FORMER Metro FM DJ Tbo Touch seems serious about taking his Touch HD online radio to another level.&nbsp; &ldquo;Touch&rdquo;, real name Thabo Molefe, has allegedly poached former Metro FM breakfast co-host Unathi Msengana to his empire.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has been told Unathi might be joining her former co-host, Glen Lewis, and Nina Hastie on The Expensive Breakfast on Touch HD.&nbsp; Unathi also fuelled speculations when she shared on social media a picture of her and Glen Lewis on Tuesday, with the caption &ldquo;Reunited with my everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Martin, the station manager, told Sunday Sun they hadn&rsquo;t had any discussions about Unathi joining the station.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can confirm that she is not, maybe in the future she will. She was just a guest. Unathi is an artist. I haven&rsquo;t sat down with the team to discuss any new person coming in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin said Tim Modise started his own show today.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;Tim will host a music show. He&rsquo;ll interact with great people and is excited as he hasn&rsquo;t done this in years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Martin added the hours on Glen Lewis&rsquo;s show would be extended. Touch will do the afternoon drive and Sammy Sosa moves to the weekend slot. He said they&rsquo;re talking to someone who would host a sports show, but wouldn&rsquo;t reveal much.&nbsp; &ldquo;Glen&rsquo;s show airs from 7am to 10am, and Touch will do the 3pm to 6pm slot. That&rsquo;s all I can tell you, and we have a new line-up. We are an online station and we need to be on our toes all the time.,&rdquo; he said. About Unathi, a source at the station claimed: &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t set the date yet, but Unathi and Glen will host The Expensive Breakfast, which he hosts with Nina Hastie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Unathi was not available for comment.
