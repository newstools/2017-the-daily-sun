FORMER &nbsp;treasurer-general of the African National Congress (ANC), Mathews Phosa has kept his word to donate part of the money he received from Mpumalanga premier, David Mabuza, to charitable causes.Last month, the Gauteng high court judge, Bill Prinsloo, ordered Mabuza to pay Phosa's legal fees following his unsuccessful civil claim for defamation against Phosa.This was after Phosa had admitted handing over a report, alleging that Mabuza was an apartheid-era spy, to senior ANC officials.Mabuza has denied the spy allegations.Phosa confirmed on Wednesday that Mabuza has paid the money, estimated at R900 000, through his attorney, Davis Mculu two weeks ago.He said that he has already donated some of it, more than R100 000 to the Khayelitsha Development Forum and St. Paul's church, which houses some of the victims of the recent storms in Cape Town."I prioritised the flood victims because their circumstances were very dire. I also donated some of the money to the church for them to buy blankets and mattresses," Phosa said.He also said he will be donating to non-governmental organisations in Mpumalanga and Limpopo during the Mandela Month (July).In court papers Mabuza claimed that Phosa and his business partner, Nick Elliot, authored the spy report with the intention of injuring his good name within the ranks of the ANC.He initially claimed R10m from Phosa but during the closing arguments in court, his attorneys reduced the claim to R1m.Judge Prinsloo, however dismissed Mabuza&rsquo;s case and ordered him to pay Phosa&rsquo;s legals fees.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/phosa-donates-spy-case-money-to-cape-town-storm-victims-20170615
