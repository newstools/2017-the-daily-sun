I RECEIVED this tweet: GOD will never ever send you someone else&rsquo;s husband. And I laughed,thinking of the orgy that would happen if God did send other people&rsquo;s husbands.&nbsp;But I&rsquo;m also grateful that God is kind enough not to send single women married men. Single women do prefer the chase and easy men are too suspicious.&nbsp; We, singles, are thankful that God won&rsquo;t give us other people&rsquo;s husbands. Obviously, that means He will send us our own husbands.&nbsp;God, we beg and beseech you to whisper in the ears of husbands that they should stop pestering young women for naked pictures or requests for sex.&nbsp; Almighty, please tell them to go home and stay home!&nbsp; Sometimes you meet a man. And he&rsquo;s fine, tight, toned &ndash; with sweat beads you want to lick. And he wants you! But you refrain because he&rsquo;s married and you don&rsquo;t need drama.&nbsp; Oh Lord, tell the husbands to stop.&nbsp; Tell them it&rsquo;s not part of your plan &ndash; just lust and lack of discipline.&nbsp; Please God, remind them that you would never send a husband to give a young woman an orgasm before noon on a Tuesday inGarankuwa.&nbsp;Single women had hoped they&rsquo;d be protected from horny husbands. But sometimes, it seems God created a huge surplus of lecherous husbands, in a world where single women prefer single men.&nbsp; Married men can be spoiled brats. They&rsquo;re getting their cake and eating it &ndash; and the neighbour&rsquo;s cake as well. It&rsquo;s so disappointing to find out your lover of six weeks, three days and 40 minutes is married! They break our hearts, Lord.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s enraging to think that for the last six weekends you&rsquo;ve been panting with pleasure. Where was God when this man omitted to tell you he was married?&nbsp; I guess I was so busy screaming God&rsquo;s name when I failed to notice obvious signs of husbandhood &ndash; calls taken in corners or baby food stains on his jacket.&nbsp; Hey, even a wedding ring would have helped with the married information. God will never send you someone else&rsquo;s husband. So, it&rsquo;s safe to say the sender is Satan. Yep, the fallen angel himself is the reason you sneak around cheating and having unprotected sex with random girls &ndash; all because you have no self-restraint.&nbsp;So girls, start telling the hotties to stay away from your husbands, and pray your men do likewise. Remind them that it&rsquo;s not God, but Satan who will send your significant other to benefit single women.
