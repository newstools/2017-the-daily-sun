THE Guptas may have captured Mosebenzi Zwane before he replaced Ngoako Ramatlhodi as mineral resources minister. It is being claimed he has been in their pocket since his days as Free State agriculture MEC. According to leaked emails, Zwane went on a Gupta-sponsored trip to India after his provincial department approved a R114 million project in 2012. Investigative journalism NGO amaBhungane reported that R84 million of money paid to a contractor was moved to a Gupta-owned offshore company. A few months later, the Guptas paid for Zwane and his choir to tour India. Free State DA leader Roy Jankielsohn said it is an open secret that the Guptas had captured Premier Ace Magashule. &ldquo;Leaked emails show Magashule&rsquo;s son Tshepiso is on the Gupta payroll. The mails show Zwane, acting on behalf of Gupta interests, interfered in the Vrede Dairy Project, costing taxpayers over R200 million to date. &ldquo;This has been common knowledge for years, supported by a Treasury report after investigation into the issue.&rdquo; Zwane came under the spotlight after the emails showed the Guptas had handpicked him to be made a cabinet minister in 2015. Last year, Zwane launched an urgent application to stop the release of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&rsquo;s report into state capture fingering him.He said he had not been given the chance to answer allegations against him. Yesterday, the SunTeam tried to get comment from the minister&rsquo;s spokesman, but all the calls rang unanswered.
