He told me he had been in a fight with someone who was demanding money. I refused to give him a knife. &ldquo;On Sunday morning when I was at the shop a white Mercedes-Benz stopped next to us. The driver got out of the car and started shooting at people. &ldquo;I ran as fast as I could but a bullet hit me on my bum. Four of us were shot, but Benedict lost his life.&rdquo;Benedict&rsquo;s sister, Kenalemang Thabana (50), said she hoped the gunman would rot in jail. &ldquo;My brother was killed for no reason.&rdquo;Police spokeswoman Sergeant Fikiswa Matoti confirmed the incident.&ldquo;A suspect (49) was arrested on Sunday and appeared in court the next day.
