So far 18 boys have been rescued. The operation will continue. “The rescued boys were found in Orange Farm, Poortjie, Majazane and Langlaagte.” Motsiri said 12 counts of assault and kidnapping have been registered at Orange Farm cop shop.“No bogus initiators were arrested and all the charges were laid against the parents,” he said.He urged parents to let cops do their job.“It never helps if parents do their own search.”
