FEWER than 20% of children from all over the world meet the recommendations for physical activity.And for the first time in history, more children are overweight and obese than malnourished.Professor Vicki Lambert, who spearheaded The 2016 Healthy Active Kids South Africa Report Card with the Sports Science Institute of South Africa and Discovery Vitality, said that the report card grades various aspects of activity and eating behaviour of Mzansi youth aged between six and 18 years.South African youth got a C for overall physical activity but a D for overweight and obesity.&ldquo;The challenges are robbing children of their full potential and they demand our urgent attention,&rdquo; she said. But the picture in Mzansi is even worse that it seems.- Malnutrition is common. While one in four preschoolers is overweight or obese, one in five preschoolers suffers from stunted growth and a shocking 74% of children in rural settings are underweight.- More than half of primary school children tested below average for motor control skills. Motor proficiency is directly linked to academic performance.- Less than half of children play sport and few do physical education at school &ndash; and it&rsquo;s often because there aren&rsquo;t any safe areas in or near school to play.- South African teens consume more than one soft drink a day and three times the recommend amount of sugar a week. High sugar intake is linked to a wide range of long-term diseases.- Most children eat less than one portion of fruit or vegetables a day. The minimum is five a day.- There are 30 million consumers of fast food in South Africa. This is up by 10 million over the last five years.- Children watch TV for about three hours a day, but a large number also watch for five hours a day.
