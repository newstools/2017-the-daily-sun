AWARD-WINNING duo Black Motion has allegedly been enjoying the spoils of the showbiz industry while their producer goes to bed hungry.&nbsp; According to insiders, Black Motion had failed to pay for the 24 songs Dr Moruti (real name Sipho Msiza) had allegedly produced for the duo&rsquo;s two albums.&nbsp; They claimed he was angry after the duo&rsquo;s Ya Badimo album bagged an award for Best Dance Album at the Sama 23 last week.&nbsp; The first source claimed a gatvol Dr Moruti had taken legal action in a bid to get Black Motion to cough up.&nbsp; The mole said the pair, Smol (real name Thabo Mabongwane) and Murder (real name Robert Mohosana), had been playing hide and seek since January last year.&nbsp; An email, seen by the SunTeam, revealed that Dr Moruti was allegedly owed R102&thinsp;000 for producing Fortune Teller in 2014, and also for the hit, Ya Badimo.&nbsp; The email reads, in part: &ldquo;The rate I&rsquo;m charging, of R8&thinsp;500 per track, is a professional rate, because my rate is between&nbsp; R8&thinsp;500 and R15&thinsp;000 per track.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I was using anger, I&rsquo;d have used my maximum rate of R15&thinsp;000 per track and also, on the other hand, Black Motion has gained massive brand appreciation arising from the quality of production, leading to bookings and sponsors. None of which I benefit from.&nbsp; &ldquo;My work is worth way more than what I&rsquo;m charging.&rdquo;&nbsp; In response, Black Motion&rsquo;s representative, Graeme Gilfillan, said: &ldquo;As I understand you, you decided to change your rate from R1&thinsp;800 a track to R8&thinsp;500 because &lsquo;the brotherhood was one-sided&rsquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;In other words, and please correct me if I am wrong, they pissed you off to such an extent, hence you decided to change the rate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Graeme suggested there was no agreement between Black Motion and Dr Moruti.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;A review of the file shows no agreement with you either, for the invoice or for the amounts. You understand making unilateral claims of amounts not agreed to requires substantiation. So, please advise what you meant by anyone buying anyone&rsquo;s composition.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No one has bought anyone&rsquo;s compositions. You are a co-author in certain finished works made available to the public and you have claimed your publishing (the owner of your share) as Faith Publishing (which cannot be found at CIPC).&nbsp; When contacted, Dr Moruti refused to comment.&nbsp; Black Motion member DJ Murder denied claims that the group owed the producer.&nbsp; Graeme denied that Msiza was owed money and that he produced 12 tracks for Black Motion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever advised you that Black Motion failed to pay for the Dr Moruti&rsquo;s services after he produced 12 songs for both Fortune Teller and Ya Badimo, is not telling the truth such statement is denied and a lie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr Msiza&rsquo;s been paid exactly what was agreed upon,&rdquo; Graeme said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What transpired, according to Mr Msiza, in his own words on Tuesday 15/11/2016 at 4.33pm is as follows: &lsquo;By that time I had told Moss my rate was R3&thinsp;500 per song, but because it was a brotherhood thing, I told them I&rsquo;ll work with R1&thinsp;800 per track, and because again the songs were too many&rsquo;., but it turns out the brotherhood was one sided so I decided to stick to business with my current rate of R8500 per track&nbsp;&ldquo;Msiza on his own accordreneged on his agreement and imposed new rates on the basis of a &lsquo;brotherhood thing&rsquo;. Changing an agreement requires an agreement from both parties,&rdquo; said Graeme.
