BLACK LEOPARDS boss, David Thidiela, is demanding R2&thinsp;million to release want-away coach Jean Losciuto from his contract.&nbsp; According to an insider at Leopards, Thidiela is not prepared to let the Belgium mentor join Premier Soccer League side Free State Stars without being compensated.&nbsp; Losciuto still has two years remaining on the three-year deal he signed with the Venda-based outfit in September last year.&nbsp; SunSport has been told Losciuto breached his contract agreement when he signed a three-year deal with Ea Lla Koto before the start of play-offs.&nbsp; Losciuto helped Lidoda Duvha move from 13th position in the National First Division and then helped them to qualify for the relegation/promotion play-offs.&nbsp; Said the insider: &ldquo;Thidiela is angry that Losciuto betrayed him when he signed a deal with Stars prior to their crucial play-offs games.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wants the coach to honour the remainder of his agreement with the club, or else Stars should buy him out of his contract.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to another source, Stars boss, Mike Mokoena, tried to intervene as his friendship with Thidiela comes a long way, but Thidiela wouldn&rsquo;t budge.&nbsp; What made Thidiela angrier was the fact that Stars also snatched his assistant coach, Sly Mosala, together with midfielder, Abubaker Mumuni, whose contract expires at the end of this month.&nbsp; Explained the source: &ldquo;Mike phoned Thidiela in a bid to resolve the squabble. But Thidiela was angry and told him what they did was wrong. He said &lsquo;why take my coach without letting me know first?&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Mokoena tried to defend their action and said &lsquo;things happen in football. Eric Tinkler joined SuperSport United and Cape Town City never fought with them&rsquo;. This made Thidiela more angry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thidiela told SunSport he was shocked by how Stars handled the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard a rumour before the play-offs that my coach had signed with Stars, and I said to Mike &lsquo;what kind of friend are you who does this to me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the last person I expected to do this to me. But he denied knowing anything.&nbsp; &ldquo;He said he&rsquo;d investigate and come back to me. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for his call since.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shocked because he&rsquo;s my best friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thidiela has now approached Losciuto&rsquo;s lawyer, hoping to resolve the matter as his coach lied to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked the coach about the rumour, but he bluntly denied signing with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I spoke to his lawyer, who was co-operative, and told him Jean couldn&rsquo;t go without following proper channels.&rdquo;&nbsp; Losciuto was not prepared to comment when the SunTeam phoned, and Mokoena didn&rsquo;t answer his phone at the time of going to print.
