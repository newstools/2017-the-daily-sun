THE couple and their daughter had just walked out of their shack on Sunday afternoon when it was suddenly caught by fire!Their terrified neighbours in Gunguluza, Uitenhage watched in horror as a wall of fire engulfed the shackBright Lebu (36) and Ntombizakhe Kilani (29) and their four-year-old daughter Qhamokuhle had been living in the one-room shack they had built next to a toilet.But today they have to sleep in one of the area&rsquo;s toilets. At least it has windows and a door, said Bright. Meanwhile they have lost everything, including clothing and groceries, ID books and Qhamokuhle&rsquo;s birth certificate.Bright told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I know it was vutha. There was no primus stove or imbawula that was lit in the shack. We had just walked out to buy food at the spaza shop.&rdquo;They are among 300 people who were moved from Joe Modise and Taliban.&ldquo;Municipal officials promised to bring us a truck load of planks so we can rebuild the shack and start over again. We are still waiting. It is inhuman to have to live in a toilet.&rdquo;
