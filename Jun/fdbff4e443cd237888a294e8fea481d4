THE moment of truth has finally come as new Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter prepares for war against the Super Eagles of Nigeria!&nbsp;On Friday, Baxter told SunSport he had selected a once-off technical team as he had not yet had the time to finalise his permanent coaching staff.&nbsp;Alex Heredia would be the goalkeeper coach, while Amajita&rsquo;s Thabo Senong and local under-17 trainer, Molefi Ntseki, would travel to Nigeria as Baxter&rsquo;s assistants.&nbsp;Said Baxter: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been serious time constraints and no time to discuss the plan for the future at all.&rdquo;&nbsp;This leaves Owen da Gama, roped into the national team by departed coach Shakes Mashaba, out in the cold.&nbsp;&ldquo;It will be very distasteful and unfair to say Baxter has dumped Da Gama. That matter is between Safa and Owen,&rdquo; Baxter said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Safa will have to inform Owen of the situation. We&rsquo;ll sit down and chart the way forward, whether the guys will be with us on a permanent basis or not. We&rsquo;ll announce later the situation with regards to the technical team permanent staff.&rdquo;&nbsp;Baptism of fire awaits the outgoing SuperSport United coach in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away to Nigeria in Uyo, the country&rsquo;s state capital of Akwa Ibom, on Saturday.&nbsp;Baxter has been vocal about how he&rsquo;d transform Bafana in the past two weeks, but it&rsquo;s time for him put his mouth where his money is. All eyes will be on him to see if he can be the saviour of local football.&nbsp;Said the coach: &ldquo;Nigeria are a quality team. But we must make life difficult for them. If we unsettle and give them problems, we&rsquo;ll do okay because we have the firepower to hurt them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Bafana and the Super Eagles have a rivalry dating back to the early 90s. So, this will be a grudge match after Bafana prevented the Nigerians from qualifying for the 2015 Afcon finals in Equatorial Guinea with two draws &ndash; a goalless draw in Cape Town and a 2-2 draw in Lagos.&nbsp;Bafana are in group E with Libya, the Seychelles and the Super Eagles for the Cameroon 2019 Afcon qualifiers.&nbsp;
