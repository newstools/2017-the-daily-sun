THE coaching roller coaster rides again at Baroka FC!Or is this the new way they plan to revive the club following an uninspiring 2016-17 PSL season that saw them retain their status via the back door?Just weeks after suspending coach Milton Dlamini Baroka have already appointed Kgoloko Thobejane&rsquo;s second-in-command, Donald Makhubedu.Bakgaga confirmed the appointment of the former Acornbush coach for the upcoming season yesterday on a one-year deal with an option to renew.Indications are, however, that Bakgaga have learnt from their brush with the axe and plan to rectify their mistakes.Dlamini&rsquo;s contract, which expires at the end of this month, will not be renewed after he was involved in a bust-up with Thobejane at the start of the promotion/relegation play-offs.Baroka CEO Morgan Mammila confirmed the news: &ldquo;The club and coach Dlamini had a meeting and there won&rsquo;t be any disciplinary hearing.&nbsp;&ldquo;The two parties agreed to go their separate ways when his contract expires at the end of June.&rdquo;Mammila also revealed that 46-year-old Thobejane is not going anywhere: &ldquo;Thobejane will continue as our head coach and he will be assisted by Makhubedu.&rdquo;Dlamini said it was the club&rsquo;s call not to renew his contract but &ldquo;I was also not willing to go back there and work in the same conditions that I faced when I got suspended&rdquo;.Baroka started their first season in the top flight under Thobejane, who was running solo at the time.&nbsp;But Thobejane got demoted at the beginning of the second round when the club appointed Jacob Sakala as the new coach and Mark Harrison as technical advisor.However, after a mere two games in charge Sakala, his assistant Edward Williams and Harrison were all suspended, which saw Thobejane being brought back to lead the club.&nbsp;He was joined by Dlamini, who didn&rsquo;t last long either.&nbsp;Now the question is, how long will Makhubedu last?
