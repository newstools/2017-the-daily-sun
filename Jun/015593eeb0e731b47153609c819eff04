LEGENDARY actress, Tina Jaxa, keeps redefining herself.&nbsp;And having a successful career that&rsquo;s stood the test of time, she says three things keep her going.&ldquo;Respect for the craft, professionalism and dedication are key in my career. I may sound like a broken record, but that&rsquo;s what I truly believe in,&rdquo; said Tina.&nbsp;She has just joined e.tv&rsquo;s Rhythm City as Andiswa, the former party girl who&rsquo;s been in and out of prison and now makes a living doing anything from scams to selling stolen goods.&ldquo;Andiswa is messed up! I often read the script and think: Wow, how messed up can one really be?&nbsp;&ldquo;I know I shouldn&rsquo;t judge her, but sometimes she shocks me and viewers are yet to see more unfold,&rdquo; said the award&ndash;winning actress.She told the People&rsquo;s Paper that playing Andiswa had been a bigger challenge than she initially thought it would be.&ldquo;I may have underestimated Andiswa. She&rsquo;s an even bigger challenge than my previous role in Gold Diggers. I&rsquo;m finding the journey very interesting,&rdquo; she said.Tina says she always encourages new actors who approach her for advice to research their roles well.&ldquo;Research is important when it comes to delivery of the character. If you know the character well, everything else will fall into place.&ldquo;But professionalism, dedication and respect for the craft are what will take you far.&rdquo;She added that she had just opened her own production house and wanted to give back to aspiring actors and filmmakers.&ldquo;I want to help open up the industry by giving passionate people the opportunity to follow their dreams, the same way I was given opportunities in my own career,&rdquo; she said.Rhythm City airs weekdays on e.tv at 7pm.&nbsp;
