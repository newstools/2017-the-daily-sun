And this track has become a dance anthem in the recent weeks since its release.It’s a build-up to his upcoming EP which he will drop later in the year.If the single is anything to go by, then his EP will be one to focus on. Speaking to Sunday Sun, the excited musician – whose real name is Chris Alvin Sunday – said he fell in love with music while growing up.His earliest memory of music was when he was around the age of seven and was moved by the harmony of a choir that he had gone to watch with his mum.“The harmony of the group moved me so much I cried, I couldn’t explain it, but it sounded like they were playing the piano with their mouths,” he said.It was his mum who encouraged him to enrol for a course in music.He studied Linguistics at the University of Ibadan and Music Technology at SAE in South Africa.Upon completing his studies and returning home, Kriz was encouraged by his mum to focus on his career. So in 2014, he began producing music professionally.Kriz said: “Often people think that being a producer means you have to be in the back row. I’m here to show that producers can be celebrities. I can deejay and perform without a microphone.”He got his stage name from his mother.“Whenever she tried to explain to people what I do, she’d say ‘Chris does beats’. I really liked it and decided to be Kriz Beatz,” he said.“Growing up, I wanted to become a pastor. But the music bug caught me. I also realised that being a pastor is not restricted to standing on the pulpit and preaching, but we can all do it through our acts.”He told the People’s Paper that his music was created and influenced by what he heard.“I’m a sound designer, and when something comes into my head, I record it.”In his upcoming EP, King Of New Wave, he works with the likes of Sarkodie, Patoranking, Olamide and Wande. He would like to work with AKA, Babes Wodumo and Nasty C, among others.Later on this year, Kriz is planning to embark on an African tour, during which he will visit these shores.
