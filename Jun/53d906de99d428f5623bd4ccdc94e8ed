THE pain of losing his brother in 2011 made Siyamthanda Mafilika realise where his talent was.The 18-year-old from Nomzamo in Strand, near Cape Town, was devastated when his older brother died.&ldquo;I felt like dying, too. I was so hurt and all I wanted to do was to find a way to let go of the pain I felt.&rdquo;He would scream for no reason. &ldquo;While screaming there would be something I wanted to say, but I did not know how to say it,&rdquo; he said.That&rsquo;s how his love of poetry started. Siyamthanda turned the screams into words. He is now a Xhosa poet. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t write down words. They just come from the heart,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;I think this is a gift from my ancestors, who gave it to me through pain.&ldquo;My poems are about what is happening and what is going through my mind.&rdquo;He doesn&rsquo;t practise. &ldquo;Words just come by themselves,&rdquo; he said.He also trained himself by listening to popular poets such as Zolani Mkiva.&ldquo;I want to be known, just like Zolani. He is a true African poet.&rdquo;Siyamthanda has performed at many local events, but he dreams of gracing bigger stages.
