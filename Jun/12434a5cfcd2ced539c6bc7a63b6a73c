UKHOZI FM presenter Ngizwe Mchunu is allegedly not a happy camper.&nbsp; This as insiders claim the entertainer, also the host of SABC1&rsquo;s traditional music show Roots, has beef with his once trusted praise singer, Mphako Mkhwanazi.&nbsp; Said the first insider: &ldquo;All hell broke loose when Mphako featured in a song titled Icala Lempama, by Ngizwe&rsquo;s chief rival, Mthandeni &ldquo;Igcokamelisha&rdquo; Manqele.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the recently released song, Mphako not only lashes out at Ngizwe, he also acts as a praise singer for Igcokamelisha.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the source, Ngizwe then decided to kick Mphako out of his &ldquo;luxurious&rdquo; home in Mbumbulu, south of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a known fact that Mthandeni is not on good terms with Ngizwe. So, by virtue of working with the maskandi singer, Mphako should have known the song would be a form of betrayal,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ngizwe only grew more angrier when he heard Mphako, his supposed praise singer, throwing harsh words at him in the song. So, he kicked him out of his house.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Ngizwe denied throwing Mphako out on the streets, saying he left &ldquo;all by himself&rdquo;.&nbsp; Ngizwe said: &ldquo;But he made the right decision because he knew he had dragged my name into the maskandi musician&rsquo;s battles.&nbsp; &ldquo;I took him from the deep rural areas of Mtubatuba because I saw talent in him. I decided to keep him in my house, so he could be closer to opportunities. After all this, he still decided to do this.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mphako insisted Ngizwe had kicked him out.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Igcokamelisha&rsquo;s despite being Ngizwe&rsquo;s praise singer. But this was never a problem. It only became one after I featured on the Icala Lempama song,&rdquo; Mphako said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ngizwe told me he didn&rsquo;t want me in his house. I then decided to move out because he&rsquo;s very short-tempered, and he could have ended up hurting me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Igcokamelisha said the praise singer&rsquo;s poetic talent had also struck a chord with him.&nbsp; He said: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell him what to say in my song, but he composed his own words. I&rsquo;ll help him since Ngizwe kicked him out of his house.&rdquo;
