MZANSI woke up yesterday morning to the news that the dark clouds around Eskom have gathered strength.The power utility&rsquo;s chairman, Ben Ngubane, resigned late on Monday night.Ngubane&rsquo;s exit was welcomed by opposition parties, who warned that the former chairman still faced tough questions.DA shadow minister of public enterprises, Natasha Mazzone, said the party found Ngubane&rsquo;s late night departure highly suspicious.It noted that his resignation came hot on the heels of damning revelations of the capture of Eskom leadership by the Guptas and the breakdown of corporate governance at Eskom.Mazzone said Ngubane, who presided over the retrenchment/retirement/rehire of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, had much to answer for, including Molefe&rsquo;s R30 million golden handshake. The DA will use the parliamentary inquiry into Eskom set to begin on 21 June to hold Ngubane to account.Cope spokesman Dennis Bloom told Daily Sun they welcomed the resignation but said the former chairman shouldn&rsquo;t think he was free.Ngubane has been named twice so far in the Gupta Leaks saga, once in connection with a failed bid to secure a highly profitable oil concession in the Central African Republic, as well as in reports about the capture of Eskom.Following Ngubane&rsquo;s resignation, Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown appointed Zethembe Khoza as interim chairman.
