THE community was supposed to elect representatives on Wednesday afternoon to take their local democratic structures forward. Then fists flew and tempers soared, and now the process of choosing ward committee members has been set back again!The scuffle was followed by angry community members setting fire to tyres outside the Soweto-on-Sea Sports Centre as the election in ward 27, Zwide kasi, Port Elizabeth came to nothing.Angry residents accused Councillor Zoliswa Dlula of manipulating the candidates list after the original number of 27 candidates was reduced to 10. They closed the centre and burned tyres at the gate. Cops were called to monitor the situation. Spokeswoman for the group, Nozuko Mantile (50), told Daily Sun: &ldquo;This is fraud. We want the whole process to start afresh.&ldquo; I was on the list but the councillor and her team removed my name and those of others. &ldquo;The new list doesn&rsquo;t reflect the whole ward made up of Zwide, Soweto-On-Sea and Silvertown. There is no representative from Silvertown. This is unfair and undemocratic.&rdquo;Buyiswa Speelman (59) said: &ldquo;I was also eliminated because I am from Silvertown. They told us we aren&rsquo;t on the list and must go home. &ldquo;We demand a re-run of these elections.Councillor Dlula later tried to persuade the residents to vote, saying: &ldquo;I am not at fault and I didn&rsquo;t cut the list. We have resolved this issue, so please come inside and vote.&rdquo;But residents shouted her down and burnt tyres.Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they were not aware that ward 27 hadn&rsquo;t completed the voting process.
