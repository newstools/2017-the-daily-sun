FOLLOWING a trophy less 2016/17 season, Kaizer Chiefs management and technical team have decided to release a number of players with a view to building a stronger, more competitive squad for next season.Seven players have been earmarked to exit Naturena after being deemed surplus to future requirements.Siyanda Xulu, Lucky Baloyi, Camaldine Abraw and Lewis Macha&rsquo;s contracts will be terminated by mutual consent following meetings between club management and the players&rsquo; respective representatives, while Enocent Mkhabela - who was loaned out to Platinum Stars during mid-season hiatus - will be given the chance to make his stay with Dikwena permanent.&ldquo;These players have contracts with the Club but they did not enjoy sufficient game-time during last season and we felt it would be in their best interests as well as ours for them to pursue their careers elsewhere,&rdquo; says Football Manager Bobby Motaung.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Siphelele Mthembu&rsquo;s contract will not be extended and the striker will be given his clearance to join a club of his choice.Zimbabwean forward, Michelle Katsvairo will be loaned out for a season and assessed again at the end of next season before a permanent decision on his future with Amakhosi is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We have decided to revamp the squad early so that when we commence pre-season training we prepare ourselves adequately for the tough season ahead,&rdquo; says Motaung.&ldquo;We owe it to our supporters to ensure that the events of the past two seasons are not repeated in the 2017/18 campaign.&rdquo;&nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs would sincerely like to thank all the abovementioned players for their commitment and contribution while wearing club colours and wish them the best of luck in the future.&ldquo;We will be making announcements in due course with regards to the new players that we will welcome into the Kaizer Chiefs family.&rdquo; concludes Motaung.&nbsp; Kaizer Chiefs Release 7 Players: https://t.co/zg9sw8hpaX #Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/1fkIAWMsRq&mdash; Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) June 13, 2017
