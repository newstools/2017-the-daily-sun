THE Blesser is getting a TV show about his life!&nbsp; This after Serge Cabonge was approached by MTV Live from London to document his lavish lifestyle.&nbsp; A source close to the situation suggests that the documentary will be aired in a few months&rsquo; time.&nbsp; A showbiz source told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;Guys from MTV approached Serge in January with the concept, and that&rsquo;s when discussions about the documentary started.&nbsp; &ldquo;Serge is excited about the documentary because he feels that last year many people in the country got the blesser thing the wrong way. He is really looking forward to it,&rdquo; said source.&nbsp; Last year, the self-proclaimed blesser shot to fame when he said he willingly spoiled the women in his life.&nbsp; Speaking to Sunday Sun, Serge said: &ldquo;Our message to the world is: my lifestyle can be for anyone else.&nbsp; &ldquo;But one thing we&rsquo;re not going to accommodate is that some people think we buy sex.&nbsp; &ldquo;The public is trying to interpret this blesser thing the wrong way.&rdquo;&nbsp; Serge said: &ldquo;The documentary will be called MTV SHUGA.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll explain how all too often males are labelled as sugar daddies, blessers and Ben 10s.&nbsp; &ldquo;My woman can&rsquo;t be spoiled by anyone else but me. And I need to show her how I love and appreciate her love for me.&nbsp; &ldquo;The documentary will be aired all over the world,&rdquo; Serge said.&nbsp; Executive Producer of MTV SHUGA, Georgia Arnold, said: &ldquo;MTV SHUGA is about the reality that affects young people. We took our blesser storyline to complete our documentary. Serge&rsquo;s role is to explain the role of being a blesser. In another episode, we take a look at abortion and HIV.&rdquo; MTV SHUGA will be aired on MTV Base on 7 June at 9pm and on SABC1 end of June.&nbsp;
