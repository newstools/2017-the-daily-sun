WHEN Steven Kgotla was sentenced to 20 years behind bars on Wednesday most of his relatives celebrated. However, the mum and sister of the 54-year-old were not at all happy, because they wanted him to rot in jail! Gogo Lina Kgotla (78) from Kgatlamping section in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she never wanted to see her son Steven again. This is because he was found guilty of stabbing her other son, Joseph (48), to death during a fight over R50. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv80y-CsPZHuuwD2Bz69ynX96JNIQvGak5_iE5Q1xEkjjhqONBu7wrPX9pf6AKcLung8n26Q09EKTs4MDHUcxyymOiJwfAQC4-QvcvxCGpgPtmhlkBRYQhwY7YIiDqc9aefw7uckw13s9WP5ZuAsiGmzQsVwDbkjjUUzPhDDoZaztU67KVVHvot7HGuxS80j7gQyTu1JgCPqa1Yppw86rYLtRRa3RcIRbsxWq8gGYcDoaQFiqaJGOuWPGFeR0ezZtNqwlet4OLTF8Ztv3v2EJzp9VeUpmw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzKiSwpm1Dhc3EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

What if he comes out after less than 10 years on parole? He deserves to be in jail for the rest of his life,” said the gogo.“I know he is evil and he will finish off the rest of us when he comes out of prison. I want the court to review the case and give him a longer sentence.” Steven’s sister, Victoria (47), said there was nothing to celebrate. “I didn’t join my sisters and other family members when they celebrated the whole night because I know 20 years is nothing. He will get parole and come back.” She said she feared Steven would go after her mum because gogo Lina had opened the murder case against him. Victoria said her brother was an evil man who used to rape relatives and steal from community members. “Whenever he committed a crime such as rape, the family used to cover it up and not open a case. We loved him and hoped he would change, until he killed his own brother,” she said. Victoria said Steven stabbed Joseph to death in front of the whole family. Captain Nelda Sekgobela, a police spokeswoman, said if the family were unhappy with the sentence they could appeal it.
