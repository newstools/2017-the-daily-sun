BIDVEST Wits have secured the signature of defender Thamsanqa Sangweni from Chippa United as they prepare to defend their Absa Premiership title this coming season.Sangweni started training with the Clever Boys on their first day back following an off-season break yesterday.According to a source close to Wits, Sangweni topped Gavin Hunt&rsquo;s shopping list because the coach wants to add stability in their defence, which conceded 22 goals last season.Wits beat Soweto giants Kaizer Chiefs to his signature, as they have been enquiring about his services for the past two seasons.Said the source: &ldquo;Sangweni was officially given the go-ahead to start training with Wits yesterday. This came after Chippa CEO Peter Koutroulis sealed the deal with his Wits counterpart, Jose Ferreira. Hunt is happy that he finally got the player, as he had tried to snatch him last season without luck.&nbsp;&ldquo;Koutroulis was also excited that they managed to get something out of his contract before it expires on Friday.&rdquo;Koutroulis confirmed the deal, adding: &ldquo;I will supply the details tomorrow.&rdquo;Sangweni has only managed to score four goals since he joined the Chilli Boys in the 2014-15 season from African champions Mamelodi Sundowns.Meanwhile, Jabulani Shongwe was still training with Wits on their first day back as his struggle to find a new club continues. The Clever Boys decided not to exercise the one-year option they have on his contract, which expires on Friday. &nbsp;
