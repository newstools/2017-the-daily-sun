THE distraught family of Mbhekiseni Mthembu wants answers!The 29-year-old from Mangethe Village in Mandeni was found hanging from the ceiling at Matigulu Hospital on 22 May. His family said he had been admitted to the hospital for almost three weeks after suffering a nervous breakdown. His uncle, Sbu Msweli (52), said it has been two weeks since his death and the family has not heard anything from the health department. He said: &ldquo;We want a detailed explanation. How was my nephew able to take his life in a facility that is full of nurses 24 hours a day?&rdquo;Sbu said nurses from the hospital arrived at Mbhekiseni&rsquo;s house and asked his mum to go to the hospital with them. &ldquo;On arrival, they took her to the ward where he was hanging. They told her they found him like that and said they didn&rsquo;t know how it happened.&rdquo; He said according to patients, Mbhekiseni was locked up alone in the ward by the day shift nurses before they went home on 21 May. They claimed the night shift nurses never checked up on him. &ldquo;We are not taking this matter lying down. We are going to fight until the bitter end. Someone has to be held accountable for this,&rdquo; Sbu said.He said Mbhekiseni was admitted when his mental condition took a turn for the worse. Apparently Mbhekiseni would often speak to himself the whole night.KZN Health spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said: &ldquo;The department can confirm the unfortunate death of a patient at one of its institutions. &ldquo;The death of any individual is a painful experience. Without prejudice, the department would like to express its condolences to the family and friends of the dead man. &ldquo;The department is unable to comment further as the incident is still subject to an inquest.&rdquo;
