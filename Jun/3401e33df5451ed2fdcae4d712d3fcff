WHAT was supposed to be a peaceful trip home turned into a nightmare the woman will never forget. After a church service on Sunday in Pimville, Soweto, she walked to the bus stop near Maponya Mall to catch a taxi.It was already late, at about 8pm, and transport to Protea Glen was scarce, so she accepted a lift from a white VW Golf metered taxi.But halfway through the trip down Chris Hani road the taxi made a U-turn in Chiawelo.The driver stopped in a dark street and started acting strangely towards the woman.Then he allegedly raped her!She escaped afterwards and ran to a nearby house, whose occupants phoned the cops.Chiawelo community leader Sbusiso Vilakazi said: &ldquo;Instead of violence against women ending, it keeps getting worse.&rdquo;Mbali Mahlangu (25) from Protea Glen said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where to go to be safe anymore. What are we going to do for transport if we hear about these cases all the time?&rdquo;Moroka police spokesman Captain Mpande Khoza said police are investigating a case of rape.&ldquo;Police are looking for a man aged about 35 to 40,&rdquo; said Khoza. &ldquo;The suspect is wanted in connection with the rape of a woman who was a passenger in his taxi from Maponya.&rdquo; Police have appealed to anyone who recognises the man in the identikit to call Constable Mashadi Phalane on 079 628 1790.People can report any information they may have to their nearest police station.
