THE little girl was peacefully playing with her friends on Monday when gunshots suddenly rang out. Terrified parents came rushing outside to find the three-year-old lying on the ground in agony, after being shot in the thigh! It soon emerged that a taxi driver had got into an argument with a passenger and had shot at the man as he tried to flee. A stray bullet ended up hitting the child. The girl&rsquo;s angry 27-year-old mum, from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, said her daughter nearly died for nothing. &ldquo;We were watching TV when we heard loud gunshots outside. After we realised what had happened, her granddad tried to catch the taximan but he was running too fast.&rdquo; The little girl was rushed to hospital and has since been released. The sad mum said she was angry with the Dawn Park Police Station as she had opened a case on Monday but had not heard from the cops since. &ldquo;Every time we try to find out what&rsquo;s going on, we get referred to the station commander but his phone is always off.&rdquo;The kid&rsquo;s dad said: &ldquo;We were worried about getting my daughter to hospital and didn&rsquo;t take down the number plate of the taxi. &ldquo;We thought the cops would look for the taxi because it was the only one at the rank with a broken window. &ldquo;The passenger had smashed it with a brick.&rdquo; Dawn Park police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Mngomezulu said a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm was being investigated.
