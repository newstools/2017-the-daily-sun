Fashion Blogger Lulama Wolf is a #StyleCrush for her simple, trendy and effortless style.&nbsp; This fashionista is always on trend, but her style does have a vintage element to it.&nbsp; Lulama always wears trendy, lose and comfortable clothing.&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t heard the term "Blogger Style", Lulama is a great example.&nbsp; Most bloggers wear trendy, structured and simple clothing.&nbsp; Lulama does the exact same.&nbsp; Lulama dresses in clothes that speak for themselves. She usually will have one item in her attire that stands out beautifully. That &nbsp;could be her shoes, hair or even the colours she wears.&nbsp; She keeps it simple but her simplicity is one that not everybody can do. She genuinely has that gift.&nbsp; Lulama loves neutral colours, which is perfect for &nbsp;the simple style.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of Lulama Wolf's fabulous style: Imbokodo ???. #Gmg17A post shared by Lulama (@lulamawolf) on May 9, 2017 at 1:19pm PDT??A post shared by Lulama (@lulamawolf) on May 4, 2017 at 12:46am PDTWhen you're Living in Levis....Orange tab collection. #liveinlevis?? | collection available in @levis_southafrica stores.A post shared by Lulama (@lulamawolf) on Apr 11, 2017 at 4:53am PDTAutumn threads #StyleBySA.
