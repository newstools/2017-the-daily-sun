A BRIDGE being built in western Kenya collapsed today, possibly because the job was rushed to fit in with a visit from the country&rsquo;s president.According to Daily Nation, a section of the Sh1,2 billion (about R149 million) Sigiri Bridge suddenly fell down. It is being built to join Bunyala North and Bunyala South, close to the western border with Uganda.There were no reports of injuries.The bridge is being constructed by a Chinese company. The builders apparently rushed things along because President Uhuru Kenyatta came to inspect it two weeks ago, leading to speculation that this is what was behind the collapse.Now villagers will have to wait longer than the scheduled July completion date for the bridge to be finished. This means that villagers will have to travel 100km stretch of road to reach the other village, instead of the 3km across the river.People are terrified of crossing the River Nzoia because of the lives it has claimed. According to the report, 11 people died in 2014 when their boat capsized while crossing the river.Joshua was here yesterday, he was heckled n today the bridge is down.
