IN Mzansi, there&rsquo;s a church in almost every street corner.&nbsp; But how much value are these organisations adding to the local communities in the areas they are situated in?&nbsp; The Mahon Evangelical Church in Southern Africa is one of a few churches that understand the role they need to play within communities.&nbsp; Last Saturday, one of their branches in Soweto organised a fundraising event to help children from disadvantaged families overcome some of the challenges.&nbsp; The church&rsquo;s Sunday School teacher Joyce Nzimande told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;The church mandated me to organise a fundraiser on behalf of the church.&nbsp; &ldquo;The aim was to help some of the children who attend the church, but can&rsquo;t afford to pay some of the money needed by the church,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Joyce added: &ldquo;Many of these children attend our church on their own.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reasons they can&rsquo;t afford to make payments at times when they are required to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fundraising event started at 9am.&nbsp; There was an 8km walk, and later everyone, including senior members of the church, were invited to an aerobic session conducted by Celiwe Mhlungu from South African Airways&rsquo; Gymnasium.&nbsp; According to Joyce, it was the first time the church had organised such a big event, and they hoped to do it again in the coming years.&nbsp; Joyce told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Our main target was to raise around R10&thinsp;000 this year, ensure the money was raised and that those who participated were required to buy T-shirts, caps and food.&nbsp; &ldquo;We hope to continue doing the same next year,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
