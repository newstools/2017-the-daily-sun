Let us entertain you and watch the skills on display from participating teams.&rdquo;The trophy will have a new home this year after 2016 winners Braamfisher Eagles, who won it by beating Rebels 4-2 on penalties following a 1-1 draw in regular time, were knocked out by ComeBoys last weekend. &nbsp; Phiri said it was interesting to note that no club had been able to successfully defend the trophy since the inception of the games.&nbsp;The event was launched in 2001 with just four teams. Now the soccer festival is proud to feature more than 140 participating teams.Said Phiri: &ldquo;The competition has grown and we are very proud of that.
