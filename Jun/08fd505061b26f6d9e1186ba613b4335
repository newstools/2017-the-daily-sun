The High Court in Johannesburg handed down a ruling on religion in public schools.The ruling states that schools can&rsquo;t promote one religion.The case was brought by the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD) against six schools.Judge Willem van der Linde said religious observances may be conducted at state or state-helped institutions provided that, those observances follow rules made by the appropriate public authorities. Secondly that they are conducted on an equitable basis and attendance at them is free and voluntary.Judge Willem van der Linde said this while handing down the judgment, quoting from Section 15 of the Constitution which deals with freedom of religion, belief and opinion."We have however also found at the level of principle that neither a school governing body nor a public school may lawfully hold out that it subscribes to only a single particular religion to the exclusion of others," said Van der Linde.OGOD wanted the court to declare unconstitutional the religion policy of six schools, Randhart Primary School in Alberton, Baanbreker Primary School in Boksburg, Garsfontein Primary School in Pretoria, Linden High School in Johannesburg, Oudtshoorn High School and Langenhoven Gymnasium in Oudtshoorn.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/schools-should-not-adopt-one-religion-to-the-exclusion-of-others-judge-20170628
