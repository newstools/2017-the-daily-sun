WHEN she shakes her hips, it&rsquo;s almost as if her little dress runs on electricity. And those who get a chance to watch Amukelani Mojiyani (2) dance ask for more. Amukelani showed off her dance moves at Block XX in Soshanguve, Tshwane, on Friday. She was dancing with her parents and their dance group at a community event. Her mum, Rebecca Mojiyani (34), told Daily Sun that Amukelani was only a year old when she saw them rehearsing at home. &ldquo;She copied us. I bought her a xibelani, a traditional dress, and she could dance in it,&rdquo; she said. Rebecca said learning how to dance in a xibelani was not easy but it was not a problem for little Amukelani. &ldquo;She loves it and doesn&rsquo;t want to take it off,&rdquo; said the proud mum. &ldquo;I never get bored when I watch her dance. &ldquo;I love how people respond when they see her.&rdquo; Amukelani&rsquo;s father, Robert Khoza (41), said his daughter&rsquo;s talent comes from him and his wife. &ldquo;All our children dance with us. Dancing is in our veins,&rdquo; he said. He said their other children also started dancing when they were young. Rapulani Dingani (29), a resident, said he had never seen someone dance like Amukelani. &ldquo;It was unbelievable. That child looked like a machine,&rdquo; said Rapulani. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.&rdquo;Masego More (20), another resident, said it was the best performance she had ever seen. She said: &ldquo;I have tried to dance in a xibelani, but I couldn&rsquo;t shake my waist and I was in pain after I took it off.&rdquo;
