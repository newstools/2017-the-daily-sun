THE Gauteng Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and provincial traditional leaders have urged parents to ensure that they enrol their children at registered initiation schools. Cogta MEC Paul Mashatile, together with Nkosi Mahlangu of the Amandebele Ndzundza Sokhulumi and Kgosi Kekana of the Amandebele Ba Lebelo traditional communities, issued the warning ahead of the 2017 winter initiation season. &ldquo;We are aware of dubious and criminal elements taking advantage of this cultural practice. Hence, in instances where unregistered initiation schools are identified, children attending such schools must be regarded as abducted and relevant legislation must be enforced to bring those unscrupulous elements to book,&rdquo; Mashatile said. He said measures had been put in place to ensure the implementation of the national policy on the customary practice of initiation in Mzansi, which will force initiation schools to operate under a set of rules and conditions, including that initiation take place during school holidays. The department said initiation season was expected to take place between June 30 and July 23. &ldquo;Under no circumstances should initiation schools commence before a school holiday or continue beyond a school holiday. In exceptional cases the owner of the initiation school shall negotiate and substantiate, with evidence, why the school shall not conform to the dates endorsed by the province,&rdquo; Mashatile said. Initiation schools have to submit applications to municipalities four weeks before the start of the season and permission to host an initiation school has to comply with the National Policy Framework on the Cultural Practice of Initiation and relevant municipal by-laws. All initiates have to undergo compulsory medical health screening before attending a school. Members of the public can call 0800 111 166 to report suspected wrongdoing.
