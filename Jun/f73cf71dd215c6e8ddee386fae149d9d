THERE were tears and joy at the Thohoyandou Stadium yesterday as Baroka retained their place in the Absa Premiership while Black Leopards were condemned to another season in the National First Division.&nbsp;Bakgaga drew 1-1 with Leopards in their final play-offs match which saw them end on top of the round robin mini-league competition on eight points from four matches.&nbsp;Leopards could only settle for second spot as they collected only five points, while Stellenbosch ended bottom of the log with two points.Lidoda Duvha came into the match with their hopes high having beaten Stellenbosch 3-1 in their last play-off match played Cape Town on Wednesday to keep their hopes of promotion alive.&nbsp;However, having conceded a goal to Stellies meant that Lidoda Duvha needed to win the game by a two goal margin without conceding against Baroka, who needed only a draw to survive the relegation axe that has already chopped Highlands Park. Bakgaga were favorites considering that even a 1-0 loss would have been enough for them to retain their PSL status.&nbsp;Kgoloko Thobejane&rsquo;s side had an advantage having beaten Leopards 2-1 in the reverse fixture played in Polokwane last week.&nbsp;Leopards were hoping to end their four year spell in the First Division having failed to gain promotion via the nerve wrecking play-offs in the 2014/15 season.Lidoda Duvha was the only remaining team that could stand between Baroka and their stay in the elite league as Stellenbosch were already eliminated from the race.There was an electrifying atmosphere with the venue filled to capacity as vocal Leopards fans came in numbers to rally behind their team.&nbsp;The game was a bit tense from the start as both teams easily lost possession of the ball.This shows that there was a lot at stake than just the three points needed in the mini league competition.&nbsp;Baroka players knew that relegation would mean losing their jobs or taking a salary cut. On the other hand, promotion for Leopards could have brought joy to their fans who are starving for top flight football.&nbsp;Baroka striker Victor Letsoalo silenced the Leopards fans in the 34th minutes when he grabbed the lead with a low shot from a rebound.&nbsp;Baroka suffered a huge blow two minutes into the second half when Letsoalo was given a red card.&nbsp;Leopards fought back and they were rewarded in the 65th minute when Siphelele Ntshangase grabbed the equalizer from the penalty spot.&nbsp;
