KOSTA Papic could be the next head coach of Platinum Stars.SunSport understands that club bosses had a meeting with the former Royal Eagles coach&rsquo;s lawyers last week in the hopes of luring the Serb to Rustenburg.Other names to have been bandied about as potential replacement for Cavin Johnson include those of ex-Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; Mashaba and Luc Eymael of Polokwane City.Our sources, who have asked to remain anonymous, told SunSport that Dikwena had agreed in principle with Papic&rsquo;s representatives that he would take over next season.Initial rumours were partly confirmed when Johnson was dismissed as Platinum Stars coach on Monday following the club&rsquo;s 3-0 Caf Confederation Cup hammering by CS Sfaxien of Tunisia at the weekend.Papic is still fresh from a spinal operation he underwent in his home country of Serbia, which saw him miss eight matches of his former club, National First Division team Royal Eagles, leading up to the conclusion of the past season. Said our source: &ldquo;The meeting was held at a top Joburg restaurant where a deal was struck. &ldquo;The coach was not available for the meeting but his business managers were. At this stage the coach does not want to talk about it, as he says he does not want his hopes raised. But club officials are happy that they might see a change in results for Stars.&rdquo;The Sfaxien loss was Dikwena&rsquo;s second continental cup embarrassment after they lost 4-2 to Swaziland side Mbabane Swallows, where they saw stars courtesy of Sabelo Ndzinisa, who scored the four goals.Making matters worse is the fact that Dikwena finished the 2016-17 PSL season outside the top eight bracket, which is a serious decline, considering their third place finish in the 2015-16 season.Papic&rsquo;s contract with Eagles is due to expire at the end of this month.Papic is well travelled, having previously coached Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs, Polokwane City and Black Leopards.Interestingly, another Dikwena reject Allan Freese, who was also shown the door by PSL side Highlands Park, is believed to be negotiating a contract extension with S&rsquo;bu Mpisane&rsquo;s KZN club, after stepping in for Papic.
