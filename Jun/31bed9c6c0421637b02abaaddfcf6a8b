THE Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters can intervene in former Eskom CEO, Brian Molefe's court case.The case on his dismissal from the parastatal is set to be heard by the Labour Court on Thursday. Molefe agreed to return to Eskom after Public Enterprises Minister, Lynne Brown&nbsp; discovered he had been granted a R30m early pension payout by Eskom, which she refused to ignore.She asked the board to find another solution and his reinstatement followed.Brown at the time said Molefe's reappointment was a better value option for the South African fiscus.Following that Molefe approached the Labour Court to challenge the decision to withdraw his reappointment.The embattled Molefe was sworn in as a Member of Parliament shortly after resigning as Eskom chief executive last year. #countryDuty The DA &amp; EFF have been granted right to intervene in #BrianMolefe case.
