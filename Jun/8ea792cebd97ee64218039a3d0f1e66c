AYANDA had developed some bad habits.His mother said he was doing things like peeing on her sofa and washing-machine. On Saturday he went on a drinking spree, hitting the bottle until he was wildly drunk.And then, in a final act of disrespect for life, he jumped in front of a speeding train between Simunye and Bekkersdal in Westonaria, Gauteng.Ayanda Hendricks (27) from Simunye survived the accident but he has paid a heavy price. He is in Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital fighting for his life.He will spend the rest of his life, whether days or years, without legs.Paramedics described his condition as serious. His mum, Nominazana Hendricks (62), told Daily Sun she asked him many times to perform the ritual of imbeleko at his father&rsquo;s home in the Eastern Cape.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cultural ritual to honour his father&rsquo;s family. A goat must be slaughtered to please the ancestors,&rdquo; said Nominazana.&ldquo;Sangomas told me Ayanda would experience serious problems for not honouring the ritual.&rdquo;Ayanda&rsquo;s friend, Siyabonga Qobo, said while they were drinking Ayanda kept on saying he wanted to kill himself.&ldquo;We asked why but he never told us. &ldquo;He was happy, singing and drinking, when suddenly he disappeared,&rdquo; said Siyabonga.&ldquo;It breaks my heart seeing Ayanda lying in hospital without legs. He refused to listen to advice.&rdquo;Bekkersdal police spokeswoman Linki Lefakane said they are not investigating a case.&ldquo;Metrorail must do the investigation,&rdquo; she said.Metrorail spokeswoman Lillian Mofokeng said they will look into the incident.Sangoma Sizwe Mthembu said respecting tradition is part of the African way of life.&ldquo;When a ceremony such as imbeleko is disrespected, the results are never good,&rdquo; he said.
