THE Pep Store branch in Philippi Mall was closed on Sunday after a break-in on Saturday.Customers were turned away while the police were busy in the shop. The thugs allegedly made a hole in the roof to get into the shop.While it is not clear what the criminals took, stolen items were later found on the roof.Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;A 23-year-old suspect was arrested and is being detained on a charge of housebreaking after he was seen fleeing the scene. &ldquo;The police are looking for the other suspects.&rdquo;Fikile Mangcobo, who lives nearby, said he wanted to send money to his mother but could not do so because Pep was closed.&ldquo;My mother does not have a bank account, so I always use this shop to send her money.&rdquo; Pumza Makade lives so close to the mall that she does not even use a taxi to get there.&ldquo;But now that Pep is closed I will have to borrow money to go to another place so I can send money to my child.&rdquo; Traut said the circumstances surrounding the burglary are being investigated.
