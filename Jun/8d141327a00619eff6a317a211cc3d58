PUBLIC Works Minister Nathi Nhleko said the construction sector is known to be dominated by white people. However, he plans to change that and is working to attract more women and black people to the industry. Nhleko was speaking to students and contractors at the construction management summit held at the department&rsquo;s office in Mayville, Durban, yesterday. He said his biggest concern about the industry was the rise in corruption. &ldquo;Most of the corruption is happening at management level and it&rsquo;s hard to fight.&ldquo;This concerns me because it&rsquo;s stopping the development of emerging young contractors,&rdquo; said Nhleko. He said corruption created inequality in the industry. According to Nhleko, construction is dominated by men who don&rsquo;t want to embrace change, which leads to corruption.&ldquo;If they think things will remain the same they are just wasting their time. I want to see lots of women and young people joining the construction sector,&rdquo; said the minister. &ldquo;I will leave no corruption uncleaned because it&rsquo;s the main cause of the lack of job opportunities in the industry. I will work closely with law enforcement agencies to make sure all these construction students have jobs when they finish their studies.&rdquo; One of the students who attended was Lerato Pako (23) from the University of Joburg.Lerato said she was studying architecture and was glad the minister was making her future a priority.&ldquo;This gives us hope that we will be accommodated in the industry in the future,&rdquo; she said.
