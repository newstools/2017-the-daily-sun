HEAPS of rocks, concrete and burning tyres could be seen from far away as furious residents took to the streets yesterday. Roads in Snow Flake, Freedom Square and Meriting in Ekurhuleni were barricaded by residents who said they weren&rsquo;t seeing service delivery in their area and they wanted their councillor to resign. The latest protest came two weeks after residents held a peaceful march and handed over a memorandum of grievances to the municipal offices in Rabasotho. They asked the municipality to respond within seven days, but that never happened. Community leader Tuis Mohale said they were tired of being ignored. &ldquo;These people agreed to come back to us on a specific date but we have heard nothing,&rdquo; he said. In the memo, community members demanded that their councillor resign. They claimed they didn&rsquo;t know who he was.Lovemore Chauke from Ekurhuleni Human Settlements invited the protest leaders to the municipal offices to discuss the matter.
