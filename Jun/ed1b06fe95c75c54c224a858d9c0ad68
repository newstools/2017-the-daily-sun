FIVE families were left homeless after a huge fire ate their shacks. The fire at Enkuthazweni Village squatter camp, near KwaZakhele kasi, broke out on Friday morning and damaged seven shacks. Firefighters were called to put out the fire. Two fire trucks ran out of water and the community members assisted with buckets of water. Five shacks were completely destroyed, as strong winds made the fire uncontrollable. Only two shacks were saved.Nompuluko Mnyanda (60) said: &ldquo;We managed to save only a few items. The fire spread so quickly and ate five shacks on our street and two on the next street. I don&rsquo;t know what I am going to do to help my husband and 11 children.&rdquo; Nomthundzi Mposi (59) said: &ldquo;The fire caught us by surprise. We could only save a few things. If we had RDP houses we wouldn&rsquo;t have lost so much. We have been calling on the municipality to build us RDP houses for so long.&rdquo;The councillor arranged temporary accommodation for the families at the Cripple Care Hall in KwaZakhele. Officials from the municipality and social workers helped provide the victims with food, clothes and blankets. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;I am not aware of the incident. However, the councillor must ask disaster management to arrange shelter and food for the residents.&rdquo;
