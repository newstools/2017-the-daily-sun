PASTOR and prophet Peter Molokomme is spitting fire.He is accusing community members of destroying his church.The Hlanganani Church of Prophecy congregation in Kromkuil, Hammanskraal has spent four months without a church.Peter said he believed there were people in his community who are jealous of his healing powers.He said they found the church demolished in November. &ldquo;One side of the wall was pushed down and all the windows were broken.&rdquo; Members of the church managed to rebuild it. But the recent damage in February has left them hopeless. &ldquo;After all the hard work we&rsquo;ve put in to rebuild the church, it was just demolished again,&rdquo; he said.One of the church members, Simon Mabuse, said he heard rumours that people suspected the church was using evil deeds to heal people.&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s why the community wants the church to go.&rdquo;
