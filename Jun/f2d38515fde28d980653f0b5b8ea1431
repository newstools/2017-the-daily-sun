She might have left us on earth but we will remember her brave and confident spirit. &ldquo;We are here to honour her and to support her family,&rdquo; she said.The doves were released by Pick n Pay director George Senosha.&ldquo;What has been going on in South Africa, with women getting killed and abducted, is sad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With these balloons, we say that we love our women and celebrate them.&rdquo;
