It was a cold winter&rsquo;s day &ndash; in the depths of the apartheid regime, 41 years ago, at a time when hope seemed to be crushed. The youngsters of Soweto stood up and gave notice to the racist tyranny &ndash; and the outside world &ndash; that change was coming, and could not be stopped. Those young rebels are now elders themselves, mostly in their 50s and 60s. They remember the flames, the blood, the sacrifices of 16 June 1976. Youth Day (this coming Friday) is dedicated to those young fighters of 76. The young people of today should be inspired. Because their courage is needed for a never-ending battle, to safeguard the future of generations yet to come.&nbsp;
