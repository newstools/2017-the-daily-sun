IT may not erase 51 years of hurt, but England have a new golden generation. Paul Simpson's Under 20s are champions of the world, they are the history boys. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the man whose name will be written in the record books, his goal ensuring the Young Lions beat Venezuela 1-0 in South Korea, but praise must be heaped upon Freddie Woodman too, whose incredible penalty save kept England in the game.Argentina, South Korea, Costa Rica, Mexico and Italy had all fallen by the sword of England before this one, and Venezuela were the final victims of a team that deserve every second of their success.England's hopes were quashed as match referee Bjorn Kuipers used video technology to confirm the spot-kick, before Penaranda stepped up to take the kick.Hearts were in mouths as Venezuela looked for their equaliser, but the strong hand of Woodman &ndash; just when he looked to have dived the wrong way &ndash; kept the penalty out, and England managed to hold on for a history-making victory.To put this triumph into context, England's last U-20 World Cup campaign saw the team finish bottom of a group containing Iraq, Chile and Egypt and all with Harry Kane, Eric Dier, John Stones and Ross Barkley in the squad.The pressure on this new generation will be heavy and, at times, hard to deal with. That Prince William sent the squad a letter pre-match shows that there is national interest in their progress.But regardless of what happens, whether these players are the heart of England&rsquo;s golden generation or not, they will always be able to call themselves champions of the world.Your 2017 #U20WC champions: @England! pic.twitter.com/Ob8D5FSAG0&mdash; #U20WC (@FIFAcom) June 11, 2017
