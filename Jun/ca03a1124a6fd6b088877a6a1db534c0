WHEN health-care workers told her she didn&rsquo;t have to worry about the complication her son was born with, she stayed calm and placed all her hopes in them. But now the 26-year-old mum from Imbali in Pietermaritzburg, in the KZN Midlands, is worried that eight months later her son has still not been operated on. Khethelo was born with anorectal malformation, a condition where a baby is born without an anal opening through which he can relieve himself. His mum Nomzamo Yalo told Daily Sun she didn&rsquo;t know how long she was going to wait for her baby to be operated on.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so stressed. I don&rsquo;t know when the doctors are going to operate on him so that he can start living a normal life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This complication affects him because he sometimes vomits and cries non-stop. It is painful to watch him suffer.&rdquo; She said when she gave birth, nurses at GJ Crookes Hospital in Scottburgh, south of Durban, did not see that her son was born with this defect. &ldquo;I only realised four days after giving birth,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;I noticed when I saw his stomach swelling and kak coming out of his penis. &ldquo;I rushed him to a private doctor, who told me that my son had this complication.&rdquo;She said nurses at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital in Durban kept postponing her son&rsquo;s operation.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m praying that this doesn&rsquo;t cause more complications in future. I am very worried and stressed,&rdquo; she said.KZN health spokesman Sam Mkhwanazi said the department had noted with concern the allegations that have been brought forward by Nomzamo. &ldquo;However, due to the fact that patient clinical information is confidential, the public does not always get balanced information,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;The department is not at liberty to discuss such information with other parties, unless it is authorised by law to do so.&rdquo;
