PEOPLE caught vandalising transport infrastructure deserve to spend the rest of their lives in jail, the United National Transport Union (Untu) has said.&nbsp; Untu said it will demand from the legislature to impose life imprisonment for these crimes - similar to that imposed for offences of premeditated murder, gang rape, serial rape and treason.This comes as vandalism caused delays on Metrorail's Cape Town commuter lines on Monday morning.Steve Harris, Untu general secretary, said the serious damage to the economy and the risk to people's lives that flows from continuing vandalism and theft warrants stricter sentencing, however felt magistrates seem loathed imposing the maximum sentence of 30 years that the Criminal Matters Amendment Act allows. On Monday morning Metrorail in the Western Cape again reported delays of up to 50 minutes due to vandalism.The transport company said last week it was already down 66 coaches since March 2016, which hampers its ability to provide its usual service."The result is that the situation has completely gotten out of hand. Our railway lines have become a war zone, but our criminal justice system simply turn a blind eye," says Harris.07:41 #CentralLineCPT Trains are delayed due to vandalism at Nyanga, Langa, Sarepta and Lavistown.
