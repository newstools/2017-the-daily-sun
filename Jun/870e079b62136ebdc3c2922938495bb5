Former police commissioner, Riah Phiyega has vowed to clear her name in the Marikana shooting.&nbsp;Over 34 Marikana miners were left dead during the Lonmin wage dispute in 2012. Phiyega rejected any guilt in the worst massacre by police in the history of democratic South Africa.&nbsp; "[I am] branded as the cause of the killing which I am not - I am not a killer. If there has been a systems failure let judges say so." Phiyega says it cannot be that she caused the shooting, because that is the narrative that is out there," Phiyega said in an exclusive one-on-one interview with News24. The shooting happened just 64 days after she had taken over at the helm, as the first female police commissioner with no policing experience.&nbsp; Her term of office ended this week, meaning unlike her predecessors, while she was suspended, she retained her title as a retired general as she was never fired.Phiyega is reviewing the findings of the Farlam Commission that investigated the deaths of 44 people including the miners, security guards and police officers in the impoverished Marikana informal settlement in North West.Phiyega still maintains she has done nothing wrong. &nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/i-am-not-a-killer-phiyega-fights-to-clear-her-name-20170614
