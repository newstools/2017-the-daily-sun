WHEN Bohentse Baruteng (48) took early retirement, he wanted to enjoy his senior years. But his missing friend, Eric Molaoloa (22), has made it hard for him to do that. Bohentse said residents of Kuruman, Northern Cape are accusing him of &ldquo;selling&rdquo; Eric. This is because Bohentse got Eric a job in Joburg, where he also used to work.Bohentse said Eric got another job in October and moved to Olievenhoutbosch. He said that was the last time he saw Eric. &ldquo;I cannot leave the house because people blame me for his disappearance. &ldquo;Whenever I buy something new, they say I&rsquo;m using the money I got from selling Eric.&rdquo; He said he could no longer take the blame and came back to Gauteng to look for Eric, who is also known as Zuma. He said after searching at a number of construction sites, he finally found the place where Eric used to work. &ldquo;I was told that he owes money to many people there and that they are also looking for him.&rdquo; Domingo Sithole (25), Eric&rsquo;s former colleague, said he worked with him for three months and claimed people were always looking for him. &ldquo;He has a tendency to borrow money and not pay it back,&rdquo; claimed Domingo. He said it is sad that Bohentse is being blamed for Eric&rsquo;s disappearance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleading with SunReaders to help me find Eric,&rdquo; said Bohentse.If you have any information regarding Eric&rsquo;s whereabouts, call Daily Sun on 011 877 6060.
