However, I had my tablet with me. &ldquo;When these guys started attacking me, I held on to it so hard that they were unable to take it. &ldquo;I ran towards the police station, but I could not find my way as I could not see clearly after the beating.&rdquo; Sammy said a motorist stopped his car and helped him. &ldquo;He rushed me to hospital,&rdquo; said Sam.
