THEY were staying next to dangerous open mineshafts in Angelo squatter camp.They thought the municipality would move them to a better place.But it turns out they are being moved to an area which also has a shaft.Angry residents of Tambo Section in Angelo, Boksburg in Ekurhuleni, accused the municipality of playing with their lives.&ldquo;Little Richard Thole (5) fell into one of these shafts early this year and was never found. &ldquo;They want our children to fall into these shafts again,&rdquo; said a resident. Residents will be moved to an area near Knights, in Boksburg. A contractor is reportedly already busy placing slabs on which more than 200 people from Angelo will be expected to build their shacks.But the community claimed that although soil had been pushed into the shaft near the site, part of it was still open.Themba Gadebe, the Ekurhuleni Municipality spokesman, said there was nothing to worry about.He told Daily Sun that all safety measures were considered when the area was investigated and approved by relevant professionals.&ldquo;Geotechnical studies were done. The shafts are sealed and the small holes that were in the area were filled.&ldquo;The land surveyor pegged the area that is suitable for development.&rdquo;But residents told Daily Sun they wouldn&rsquo;t go.&ldquo;We are just going there to die. It is better that we stay behind.&rdquo;Richard Thole (5) slipped into an open mineshaft in March this year while playing with a friend in Jerusalem, near Angelo.His body has never been found.Ekurhuleni Emergency Services and the South African National Defence Force tried in vain to retrieve his body from the unstable shaft but eventually the search was called off.
