JOSEPHINE Matabo and her family had no idea their desire to start a business would lead to ruin. They saw an advert from a prophet claiming he could strengthen businesses and invited him to their house. But he disappeared with the R125 000 they gave him.Josephine (50) from Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, said the prophet took her husband&rsquo;s life savings. &ldquo;We have been left with nothing to eat.&rdquo; Josephine said the traditional healer put their money in two steel boxes and told her husband not to open them until he gave them further instructions. On Friday, after having had the boxes for two weeks, they decided to open them. &ldquo;We found them full of paper. We called him but he didn&rsquo;t answer his phone.&rdquo; Tembisa police spokesman Captain Manyaza Ralidzivha said cops are investigating a case of theft. He also warned SunLanders to exercise caution before they give their money to sangomas.
