SO SERIOUS is Black Leopards chairman David Thidiela about retaining Jean-Francois Losciuto that he has already started interviewing assistant coaches to work with the Belgian. Thidiela repeated yesterday that Losciuto still had a valid contract with the club and was GOING NOWHERE.This is despite Free State Stars&rsquo; interest in his services and the widely reported news that the Belgian has signed a three-year contract with the Bethlehem outfit.There is in fact a new shocking twist to the tale, as rumour has it that Ea Lla Koto are no longer interested in luring Losciuto to their stable following demands by Leopards for R2 million in compensation before they release him.Losciuto is contracted to Leopards until 2019, having joined the club in November last year.Said Thidiela: &ldquo;Jean is going nowhere. He has a contract with the club and it&rsquo;s binding. If somebody from another club pays what we want, we will release him.&rdquo; One of the assistant coaches interviewed by Thidiela is Abel Makhubele, who is tipped to be the hot favourite to land the assistant coach job. If appointed, this will be his second spell, having served as assistant in the 2012-13 season when Lidoda Duvha were still campaigning in the Absa Premiership. He was given the caretaker role in the same season following the sacking of Ian Palmer due to a string of poor results that saw the club get relegated.Thidiela added: &ldquo;I have already interviewed seven candidates, including Makhubele, who have applied for the job as Jean&rsquo;s assistant. We will soon make our decision and an announcement when the deal with the right candidate has been finalised.&rdquo;Meanwhile, Leopards have hanged &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs on midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase and Lebo Mabotja.
