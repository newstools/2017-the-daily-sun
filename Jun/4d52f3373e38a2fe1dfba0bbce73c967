FORMER Generations: The Legacy actress Noluvuyo &ldquo;Bubbly&rdquo; Sodela, who played Bongi in the SABC1 soapie, is angry with Tshedza Media.This after she said they called her in for a show, only to find herself being judged.Bubbly said when she was called in to Mzansi&rsquo;s reality show Freedom is Not Free on SABC1, she thought it was to express her views.&ldquo;The name of the show is Freedom Is Not Free. I thought they&rsquo;d have a conversation with me because, when they approached me they said they were going to talk about the naked shoot I took part in, in protest against xenophobia,&rdquo; she said.Bubbly said she agreed to be documented, but when she recently watched the show, she wasn&rsquo;t pleased with what she saw &ndash; as they were judgmental toward her.&ldquo;I was shocked and disappointed by the end product,&rdquo; she said.Owner of Tshedza Media, Takalani Mulaudzi, said Noluvuyo could have brought that up during the shoot.&ldquo;We were discussing how social media had become a platform that could make or break a person. I don&rsquo;t understand why I&rsquo;m explaining something that was shot two years ago,&rdquo; Takalani said.&ldquo;If she saw it recently, then it was a repeat. I won&rsquo;t justify how, as editorial, we put the show together. If she wants me to explain anything to her, she should call me.&rdquo;SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago refused to comment, saying the matter was between the production company and the actress.
