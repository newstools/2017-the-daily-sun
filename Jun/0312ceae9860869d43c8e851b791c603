THEY are barely three years old in the game, and yet Uthongathi FC have written their name in the history books of KwaZulu-Natal football.The Cane Cutters are the first KZN team to be promoted to the National First Division (NFD) by being crowned National ABC Motsepe League champions under the new South African Football (Safa) structure.&nbsp;They beat Super Eagles of Free State in the final and they&rsquo;re now ready to prove their worth in the NFD.&nbsp;Their chairman, Nkosinathi Chili, who is also the mayor of Ndwedwe Municipality, is excited and yet wary of what lies ahead.&nbsp;Said Chili: &ldquo;We are new in football and still learning. Our journey hasn&rsquo;t been easy but with dedication, understanding and unity we&rsquo;ve managed get where we are today. We are excited of what we have achieved.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will continue to engage with other teams in the province ahead of us just to get pointers. We want to sustain ourselves in our first season in the NFD. We don&rsquo;t want be a yo-yo team by being in and out of NFD.&rdquo;&nbsp;In July, Uthongathi will be turning three years old, which makes their journey to the NFD incredible.&nbsp;The 2014/15 season was their first in the SAB league and got promoted to the ABC Motsepe League. They surprised everyone when they won it without a single defeat.&nbsp;In 2015/16 they came second from Kings in the Motsepe League.&nbsp;&ldquo;That season was an eye opener for us. That is where we realised that we can go to the NFD if we push hard. And that exactly what happened.&nbsp;&ldquo;Personally I think it was a blessing in disguise that Kings were the champions last season.&nbsp;&ldquo;Playing our second season in the Motsepe League gave us enough time to correct the mistakes of our first season. . That is why it was easy for us to win in the province and nationally this season,&rdquo; added Chili.&nbsp;He added: &ldquo;The team is not run only by myself. I&rsquo;m the chairperson and there&rsquo;s also the president Nico Mkhize and General Manager Mtho Nene.&nbsp;&ldquo;The coach, Ronnie Gabriel, has been with the team from day one and he&rsquo;s also part of our management structure.&nbsp;&ldquo;Gabriel will continue with the team in the NFD.&rdquo;&nbsp;The newcomers will be looking for a new home ground since the Shaik Mohideen Stadium at Uthongathi in Durban.&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve sent a proposal to Ethekwini Municipality to revamp the stadium. We might consider using the Princess Magogo in KwaMashu while our stadium is still under construction.&rdquo;&nbsp;
