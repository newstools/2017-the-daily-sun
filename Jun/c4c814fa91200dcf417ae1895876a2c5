OSCAR Mncube may be blind but he knows very well that he deserves an honest woman who will be his eyes for the rest of his life.Oscar said he became blind when he was a toddler after suffering from jaundice.The 35-year-old from Nquthu, northern KZN told Daily Sun he hasn&rsquo;t been lucky in love.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only had two girlfriends in my entire life. Both of them failed to show me they deserved to be with me,&rdquo; he said. He said he had his first girlfriend when he was 25. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t want to be seen in public with me. She would come to my home but when I wanted to go out with her she would refuse. Our relationship lasted five months. &ldquo;After breaking up with her I didn&rsquo;t date again until I was 33, when I met the second woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we broke up that same year because she used to drink a lot.&ldquo;I thought I had finally met the right person. I tried talking to her but she wouldn&rsquo;t stop.&rdquo; Oscar said the woman used to visit on the days he received his disability grant and take his money. &ldquo;I think she was with me so that she could get money to buy booze. That relationship didn&rsquo;t last and I have been single for about two years,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stayed single because I&rsquo;m waiting for the right woman.&rdquo;Oscar hopes SunReaders will help him find the woman of his dreams. &ldquo;I want a kind and caring woman. I want her to take care of me and my mother. I will pay lobola for her because I want her to have children with me,&rdquo; he said.He said besides his grant money, he also plays the concertina to earn extra cash.
