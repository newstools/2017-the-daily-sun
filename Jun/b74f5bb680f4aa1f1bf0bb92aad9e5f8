Motorists were too scared to pass next to the protesters and even a police van kept its distance. Sipho Sithole (45), a resident, said: “While we were leaving for work, they attacked us and started destroying our shacks.” Johan Bosch, the Red Ants’ managing director, said they acted after being given an order by the sheriff that had come down from Prasa, as residents were living right next to the railway line. “Our guy was shot and when he fell down he was stabbed to death.“We were withdrawing when the protesters attacked,” he said. Bosch said he was deeply hurt by the killing of one of his employees. “It’s a very sad thing. I’m like a father to these guys. I’m very worried about the violence that goes on.” Bosch said they would be assisting the family of the victim with funeral arrangements. Police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said one case of murder and two of assault were opened. “We were told there were claims that residents were also killed and injured but no one has come forward to open cases.” Masondo appealed to residents to come forward with information about the murder as it happened in broad daylight.
