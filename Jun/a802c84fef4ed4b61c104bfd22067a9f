A 13-year-old boy from Snake Park, Soweto will probably be haunted for the rest of his life after he was kidnapped and brutally assaulted in what might have been a ritual murder attempt.The boy was waiting for his school transport last Monday when a man from the area picked him up from school. When the man, who is known to the boy, told him they had to help his uncle with a flat tyre the boy got into the car. The boy&rsquo;s gogo (55) and uncle (33) said he was taken to open veld near the old Durban Deep mine in Roodepoort. &ldquo;That man sucked his blood and beat my child. I believe he wanted to perform rituals on him and then bury him, but God spared him,&rdquo; said the gogo.She said the man stripped him half-naked and poured sand over him. &ldquo;My boy had knife cuts on his neck, hands and upper body. His eyes were bloodshot from the beating.&rdquo;The uncle said the man apparently left the boy in the veld, thinking he was dead, but he managed to find a mine security guard, who took him home.The boy said he&rsquo;s having trouble sleeping, his body aches and he fears going back to school.Sangoma Manhlinza Dlamini said: &ldquo;In most cases the blood of children is sucked to make the attacker rich or to find love.&rdquo;Constable Mzwakhe Xazi, a Dobsonville police spokesman, said: &ldquo;A 33-year-old suspect was arrested for kidnapping and attempted murder.&rdquo; He appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court on Thursday and the case was remanded to Wednesday.
