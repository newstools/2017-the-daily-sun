THE father of the two little girls who died in a flat fire in Phoenix, north of KZN, is struggling to come to terms with their deaths. Speaking to Daily Sun on Monday after his release from hospital, where he was admitted following his collapse, Clinton Govender (29) said he wished he could undo everything that had happened. &ldquo;I loved my girls and never wanted them to die. I would be lying if I said I was coping.&rdquo; His daughters Nokubonga Lembethe (6) and eight-month-old Nikitha Lembethe were burnt beyond recognition when the flat caught fire. The blaze was allegedly caused by a burning candle on Sunday morning.Clinton said when the incident happened, he had locked the kids in the flat and gone to check on their mother, Noxolo Lembethe. Noxolo had moved out and had gone to her mum&rsquo;s house after an argument on Saturday.&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have electricity so we use candles for lighting. I can&rsquo;t tell which candle caused the fire because there were many of them in different rooms. It took me longer than expected to return to the flat and I was greeted by the blaze shooting out of the windows.&rdquo; Noxolo&rsquo;s mother, Zandile Lembethe (43), said she was told about the incident while at a relative&rsquo;s traditional ceremony.&ldquo;When I left for the ceremony on Saturday night, I left my daughter in the house as she said she wanted to clear her head. She told me she had left the kids in Clinton&rsquo;s care. &ldquo;Noxolo lives with Clinton but they&rsquo;re not married. She often comes to my house when they fight because I don&rsquo;t live too far from their flat.&rdquo;She said Noxolo was too emotional to talk to anyone.Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, confirmed the incident.&ldquo;Two inquest dockets were opened at Phoenix Police Station and the circumstances around the incident are being investigated.&rdquo;
