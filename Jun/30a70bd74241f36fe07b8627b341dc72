MZANSI parents were shocked when the horror blood-sharing drug called Bluetooth hit the streets. But now, kids as young as seven years old are getting trapped by another evil drug!This time it&rsquo;s &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo;, a mix of pen ink, mealie-meal and paraffin &ndash; the latest crazy drug to hit the streets of Cosmo City, west of Joburg.Angry parents said the kids had to be stopped.&ldquo;We hear that there&rsquo;s an older pupil who is teaching our children how to make the drug,&rdquo; said a concerned parent.Community patrollers in Cosmo City told Daily Sun that more than 30 kids are believed to be smoking the drug at a primary school in the area.&ldquo;It is worrying to see kids as young as seven smoking the drug.&ldquo;What does the future have in store for them if they start at this young age? &ldquo;We are deeply worried,&rdquo; said community patroller Fire Morowane.An adult showed Daily Sun how the drug is made.The kids spread the ink and mix it with mealie-meal, paraffin and wrap it like a zol. They then strike a match, smoke it and quickly get high.Daily Sun spoke to a parent whose two children smoke the drug.&ldquo;I tried to talk to them but you never know what they&rsquo;ll do when you are not with them,&rdquo; said the parent.&ldquo;We appeal to parents to always watch their children&rsquo;s behaviour.&ldquo;When they start, they become aggressive and disobedient,&rdquo; said a patroller.Morowane said they planned a parents&rsquo; meeting in the community to discuss the problem of drugs. Gauteng Education spokesman Steve Mabona said: &ldquo;The department is highly concerned about the allegations of substance abuse at a primary school.&ldquo;We will dispatch officials to investigate claims. The investigation&rsquo;s outcome will determine what steps should be taken by those involved.&rdquo;
