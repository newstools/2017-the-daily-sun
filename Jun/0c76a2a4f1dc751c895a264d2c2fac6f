PLATINUM Stars will need to tighten their defence if they are to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Caf Confederation Cup. That is the view of assistant coach Willem Jackson who will be on the bench when Dikwena host Tunisian giants CS Sfaxien tomorrow at the Royal Bofokeng Stadium (7pm).This will be Stars&rsquo; first match since the club parted ways with Cavin Johnson who was in charge when they lost their last Confed Cup match 3-0 to Sfaxien in Tunisia a fortnight ago. Stars go into this encounter rooted at the bottom of Group B with a single point after three fixtures, having lost two and drawn one. With three more games remaining &ndash; two at home and one away &ndash; Dikwena still have a chance of making it to the next round if they can manage to collect all nine points. But they have to beat Sfaxien to keep their hopes of a place in the quarterfinals alive.In their last two Confederation Cup matches Stars conceded seven goals and only found the back of the net twice, and that is a serious concern to coach Jackson who said: &ldquo;We are still in the competition. We only need to minimise our mistakes in defence and make sure we convert the chances we create. &ldquo;That is the only way that will help us. There are still nine points to play for.&rdquo;Dikwena have not lost a Confed match at home. Jackson believes that will also play a role in boosting his players confidence going into this encounter.He said: &ldquo;The players are fully focused and they have been working hard. We know that Sfaxien won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park but we will give it our best shot.&rdquo;Meanwhile Stars confirmed that former Botswana national team coach Peter Butler will take over from Johnson, whose contract was not renewed.
