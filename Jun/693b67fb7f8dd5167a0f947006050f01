WHILE the strike by Gauteng mortuary workers continues, a family is worried. The funeral of their father had to be postponed from last weekend to tomorrow but now it seems the funeral won&rsquo;t happen at all.The pleas of the Masibi family from Dobsonville, Soweto for their dad&rsquo;s body has apparently fallen on deaf ears.The family said they&rsquo;ve already made funeral arrangements twice, and had spent a lot of money on a funeral that may not even take place. &ldquo;My father died in Helen Joseph Hospital last Monday. We made plans to bury him that Friday, but they refused to give us the body,&rdquo; said Ramoutshe Masibi (31).Under normal circumstances, the family would have received the body of Simone Masibi (58) not long after his death. But until today the family has been kept waiting. The Gauteng Department of Forensic Pathology met with workers yesterday to try and resolve the mortuary chaos.Later it said the officers had agreed to return to work, but that does not seem to be the case.Gauteng MEC Gwen Ramokgopa said the department was committed to working with angry officials to resolve their problem within a legal framework.
