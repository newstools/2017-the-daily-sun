Dear MizzB When I was seven years old, my cousin used to come to my side of the bed and rape me. I am now 16 years old and I hate him! He pretends to be a man of God but he is evil. When he and I are alone in a room, he tries to touch and kiss me. I hate myself for what he did to me. I feel disgusted with myself and I am afraid to date because they will see how impure I am. - Princess Dear PrincessWhat your cousin did to you is not your fault. The fact that your cousin still targets you means he enjoys abusing you in this manner. You are a survivor, not a victim.This behaviour will only stop when you stand up and take back your power! This means you have to report him so he does not victimise anyone else.It is also wise for you to go to your local clinic for a medical check-up. Tell an adult, a teacher or a nurse about the matter. Break the chain and let the shame he inflicted on you fall on him. Expose him so you can start healing. Send a Please Call Me to 083 323 1023 to speak to a counsellor.
