ON Saturday, Bucs looked worse than their Swedish coach, Kjell Jonevret, could ever have imagined.The team was disorganised and hardly looked threatening as they collapsed against SuperSport United, suffering a humiliating 4-1 defeat.Angry Orlando Pirates fans have taken to social media with memes to let the team know exactly how they feel.Ntandokayise? @Ntandoe30: What a big blow for Amabakabaka. I&rsquo;m already counting the days for the Bucs coach.Samantha Sammie: Stop abusing women, children and Orlando Pirates. Enough is enough!Mirriam Masilela: Huuu mabucaneer. I blame our chairman, Irvin Khoza, for the release of Rooi Mahamutsa, Daine Klate, Sifiso Myeni and Eric Tinkler. It&rsquo;s a big mistake. I can&rsquo;t forgive him.Brenda Mazibuko: Pirates have taken a decision not to win anything until the president steps down. That&rsquo;s our contribution to the struggle. Lineo Leboto: I&rsquo;m sure Senzo is tossing and turning, wherever he is. May whoever killed you suffer even in the next life. We wouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation if you were still alive.Thomas Ngaka: The noise made after we lost made me realise how big Orlando Pirates is. This is clear evidence that everybody loves this team. We lost guys but big up to Thabo Rakhale. What a player. Askies about the loss, bafowethuThandi Dlamini: My favourite team disappointed me last night but no matter what, I&rsquo;m still a Bucs supporter.
