RESIDENTS are furious after men escaped from their local cop shop. The suspects, who were bust for dangerous crimes, walked out of Sophiatown Police Station, Joburg in broad daylight! Residents told Daily Sun they are living in fear that the men might attack them. According to the police, nine suspects escaped on Monday but four were soon rearrested. Cops are working to catch the remaining five. A community leader said there should be a proper investigation into the escape. &ldquo;The police do not care about us. What if these men come back to finish off their victims?&rdquo; he said.An angry resident said the station is so rotten it should just be shut down. &ldquo;The cops get money from criminals and their relatives. They are not fighting crime,&rdquo; he said. The escaped inmates were allegedly all suspected of shooting people in Westbury and Sophiatown. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Thomas de Bruyn confirmed that five suspects were at large after escaping at about 2pm on Monday.He said the men pushed the cell&rsquo;s gate open and ran away. The same police station was in the news two years ago when senior officer Colonel Mohale Masia (51) was arrested by the Hawks after he allegedly took bribes for dockets to be destroyed.
