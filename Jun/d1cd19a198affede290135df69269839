A MAN wanted for hijacking and raping a woman in December 2016 left his wallet behind when he committed the crime. Captain Xoli Mbele said the 31-year-old woman, who was travelling in a white Mercedes C32, was accosted by two men when she stopped at Leonard Caf&eacute; in Booysens in December 2016. Mbele said the men held the woman at gunpoint and forced her into the back of the car before driving off. They threatened to kill her. She was raped several times in a veld in Lawley. &ldquo;They left her in the veld and she was later helped by community members,&rdquo; Mbele said. One of the men who raped her left his wallet in the field with his driver&rsquo;s licence in it. The suspect was identified as Lungelani Shamase, 26. Mbele said the incident was brought to his attention only on Monday. &ldquo;A team from Booysens was investigating the incident but now a different team is leading them,&rdquo; he said. Police are appealing to the community or anyone with information about the whereabouts of the suspect to contact Johannesburg Central Cluster Detectives' Sergeant Kenneth Nefuranyele on 082 964 7771 or 011 497 7114.
