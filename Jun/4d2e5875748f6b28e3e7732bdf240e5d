A woman from W section in Umlazi, south of Durban, is furious after the eight rooms which she rents out were bulldozed yesterday.Bazamile Gumbi (53) said security guards arrived with a tractor and knocked down the rooms while the tenants were at work.Angry Bazamile said when she confronted them, they told her she was encroaching on her neighbour&rsquo;s yard.&ldquo;I bought this land in 1994 from the previous owner,&rdquo; she said.She built four mud rooms in 1994, which she destroyed in 2011. She then rebuilt the rooms with bricks.&ldquo;I then built an additional four rooms in 2013. I think my neighbour did not like it.&rdquo; &ldquo;In 2014, she came to my house and said the new municipal demarcation map showed that the land where my rooms were built belonged to her.&rdquo;Bazamile said she reported the matter to the councillor.&ldquo;He just told me to give the land back to my neighbour. I don&rsquo;t know what to say to the tenants when they come back from work.&rdquo;Councillor Amon Dladla denied any knowledge of the matter.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still going to check with the local committee to get all the facts because I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.&rdquo;
