THE youth of Nnereng Village outside Bochum, Limpopo, used to kill time at taverns.But this didn&rsquo;t go down well with Frans Madibana.The 60-year-old decided to do something about it.The madala opened a soccer academy and hopes to train future soccer stars.The Mankota Football Academy was officially opened on Saturday and caters for U-13, U-17 and U-19 players.Speaking at the launch, Frans said: &ldquo;Our kids were drinking their lives away even though they are amazingly talented. &ldquo;I believe this academy will save their lives and produce superstars who will go on to play top-flight football and fly our village flag high. I want to help them to succeed.&rdquo;Frans told Daily Sun it has been a long and hard road for him.&ldquo;For many years, I wanted to do something positive for the community. I approached the village headman and asked him to give me land on which to build the academy. &ldquo;He loved the idea and gladly agreed.&rdquo;The U-19s are currently playing in the Blouberg Football League.They finished in fourth position last season.&ldquo;We are aiming high. I want to see this team playing in the ABC Motsepe League (previously known as the Vodacom League), which is the South African Football Association second division league.&ldquo;Then our players will catch the eye of local scouts,&rdquo; he said.Frans aims to add disciplines such as netball, rugby and swimming in the future.
