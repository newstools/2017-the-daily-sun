DO YOU REMEMBER the big Gupta wedding at Sun City in 2013?Well.....you paid R30m for it.The #GuptaLeaks reveal that the Free State provincial government largely paid up for the lavish wedding.Money that was meant for the Free State&rsquo;s Vrede dairy project was used to pay much of the wedding expenses &ndash; R30m to be exact.In 2013 AmaBhungane revealed how the Free State provincial government had gifted an unknown company, Estina, a free 99-year lease to a 4 400-hectare farm outside Vrede.Estina&rsquo;s sole director was an IT salesman with no farming experience. The government also promised Estina R114m a year for three years to set up a farming operation and dairy, whose supposed purpose was to empower locals and boost provincial agriculture In 2013, amaBhungane established that Estina had an address also used by Gupta companies and that Kamal Vasram, its sole director, had ties to the Guptas.Dozens of e-mails and other records show the Gupta family not only had significant control over the scheme but diverted much of the provincial government&rsquo;s funding for it to their own purposes.The Gupta family is also known to enjoy a close relationship with president Jacob Zuma.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/guptaleaks-the-dubai-laundromat-how-millions-milked-from-free-state-government-paid-for-sun-city-wedding-20170629
