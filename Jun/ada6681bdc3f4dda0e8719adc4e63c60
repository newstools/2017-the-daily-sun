APPLYING for an ID can be a walk in the park for many South African citizens, but for others it&rsquo;s a nightmare. For nine years, Shadrack Khunou (67) has been trying to get his ID, without any luck. The madala from Bojating Village, outside Mogwase in North West, lost his dompas years ago. In 2008, his granddaughter Patricia Mebe (34) took him to the Mogwase Home Affairs offices to apply for a new ID. They got shocking news . . . &ldquo;I was told that the Home Affairs system says I&rsquo;m not South African and there needs to be an investigation before I could get my ID,&rdquo; said Shadrack.Patricia said: &ldquo;My grandfather was accused of being a liar. The person who was helping us kept telling him to tell the truth that he&rsquo;s a foreigner. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re poor and it&rsquo;s difficult to get money to go to the Home Affairs offices. We&rsquo;re always told the same story. &ldquo;They take his fingerprints, but there is no progress. I don&rsquo;t understand what kind of investigation takes nine years.&rdquo; She said the madala couldn&rsquo;t apply for a pension grant without an ID. Shadrack&rsquo;s brother Motsamotsa Khunou (73) said: &ldquo;We recently went together to Home Affairs when I went to apply for my smart ID card. &ldquo;Unfortunately, my brother couldn&rsquo;t get his. We&rsquo;re brothers. Why wasn&rsquo;t I told that I&rsquo;m a foreigner?&rdquo;Marilyn Ndlovu from the Pretoria Home Affairs office said: &ldquo;Shadrack definitely needs help. I&rsquo;ll make the deputy director and chief director aware of his situation.&rdquo;
