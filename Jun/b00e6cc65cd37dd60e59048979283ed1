THERE was a time when Thulani Lumbela lived a normal life.But that has all changed.His happiness has been ruined by a terrible growth under his chin. Thulani (36) from Ovondlo in Nseleni outside Richards Bay, KZN, said the growth started developing in 2012. &ldquo;I shaved my beard and discovered I had a rash, but I didn&rsquo;t take it seriously. &ldquo;Later I noticed it was getting bigger. I didn&rsquo;t know what it was,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;At that time I was in a relationship with a woman I truly loved. But because I couldn&rsquo;t treat the growth, she left me.&rdquo; He said doctors tested him and he had an operation, but they never told him what caused the growth. &ldquo;They removed the growth in 2014 and I was a happy man again.&rdquo; He said he found a new girlfriend, but two months after the operation, the growth came back.&ldquo;The new girlfriend also left me.&rdquo; He said he tried different muthi to remove the growth, but had no luck. &ldquo;I think a strong inyanga might help me because I&rsquo;m tired of this lonely life.&rdquo; Sazi Mhlongo, president of the South African Traditional Healers Association, said the growth could be healed without consulting an inyanga.&ldquo;Thulani should contact me so that I can give him instructions.&rdquo; Doctor Asif Suleman from Medicoast surgery said he couldn&rsquo;t say what caused the growth until Thulani was tested. &ldquo;He must consult a doctor to confirm what is wrong with him before trying to treat it.&rdquo;
