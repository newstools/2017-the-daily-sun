RADIO presenter and DJ Sizwe Dhlomo and businessman and motivational speaker Vusi Thembekwayo have been at each other’s throats since last Thursday. The fight between the two started on Twitter after Sizwe accused Vusi of stealing his ideas. It came after Sizwe posted a number of tweets in which he said 1 200 taxis were sold every month in South Africa and owners had the numbers to start their own dealerships and institutions to offer financial services. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssZBPNfHWpeuHH3HCSVYNo29Wx-rheSVk712v16ULXJLHCP6zW0sXfQa7PBKN_s5RcHNjKgGSdMiSRfONuyC3Owj0cW1SFnss_bjvUVhz_K37r6MeyYmdpdBSNXmhE5xKeyd8wumNzorPQadcJG-fB4bS8odiK38lQKC0U_x_UwN-O3oM_hEfCuDo21DylzA_V6SDTbrO445Vv545pr-UKRx5k5IvcD5uFfzsKGPxtgmW8m3zR3A9Ta3eiY9WND75HBfvMOp3qPPIHtUvU70NA8-9nQZ0w\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDO8Gi2qQr-hEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

In the video, Vusi gave a similar point of view and also said 1 200 taxis were sold every month. Sizwe picked up on the Facebook video and was soon accusing Vusi of stealing his ideas. In a video he posted to Twitter he said: “This guy posted my entire thread as his thoughts. “It is all good, though. Knowledge does not get depleted by getting shared.” However, Vusi did not take the accusation lightly and responded with a video on Facebook. In the video, he called Sizwe a little girl for attacking him on Twitter. He also said he was running R400-million projects while Sizwe was still spinning decks on Yfm. Vusi said as a Zulu man he felt his reputation was everything and asked who Sizwe thought he was. He said if Sizwe had anything to say about him he could contact him and invite him on his show so he could tell him to his face.The two carried on sending tweets to each other over the weekend and it did not seem likely they would be kissing and making up any time soon.
