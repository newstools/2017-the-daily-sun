THE Department of Home Affairs will continue offering services on Saturdays. The Public Servants Association and other unions representing Home Affairs officials will meet on Tuesday, as instructed by the Constitutional Court, to resolve issues of working hours. This was said by the department&rsquo;s director-general, Mkuseli Apleni, at a media briefing in Tshwane on Wednesday. He said they are aware that the unions wanted to use the meeting as a platform to protest. The Cabinet, he said, realised the importance of operating on Saturdays. &ldquo;Failure on our side to do this would mean that families cannot bury their loved ones, people can&rsquo;t travel, and Sassa can&rsquo;t issue child grants as they depend on birth certificates.&ldquo;The initial change to include Saturdays was an instruction from the Cabinet in 2004,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;In 2004, the staff worked the mandatory 40 hours, from Monday to Friday, and those who worked Saturdays were paid overtime.&rdquo; Apleni said the department couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay officials more overtime in 2010. They then hired contract workers.&ldquo;We then absorbed 1 064 contract workers to become permanent staff using the overtime money.&rdquo; He said their concern was to improve services. &ldquo;There is no life if the department is closed on Saturdays,&rdquo; he said.
