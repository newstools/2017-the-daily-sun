NO tests were done to establish if Popi Qwabe and Bongeka Phungula were raped. This information came out at the bail hearing on Friday for the two men accused of killing them.The Protea Magistrates Court heard that the pathologist working on the case didn&rsquo;t conduct a rape examination because he was busy.During cross-examination, investigating officer Constable Sibusiso Masuku said there was no time to determine whether the two victims were raped.He told magistrate Herman Badenhorst the police didn&rsquo;t think a rape kit was necessary as the women were found fully dressed and one of them was wearing a sanitary towel.Badenhorst lashed out at the police, saying that a rape kit would have helped police to verify information on the suspects.Masuku told the court that he was not sure when a forensic report on the case would be released.He maintained that there was strong evidence to prosecute the two men. &ldquo;Even if the forensic report does not link the two, I still have a strong case,&rdquo; he said.The suspects were granted bail on Friday afternoon. Badenhorst said refusing bail would be unfair because the state&rsquo;s case was vague.The bodies of the two girls were taken to KZN for burial.
