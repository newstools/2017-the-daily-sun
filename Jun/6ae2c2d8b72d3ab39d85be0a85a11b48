RESIDENTS of Ecrosini transit camp protested yesterday and blockading roads with burning tyres, rubbish and trees. The protesters said they were angry about the high electricity rates people living in the camp in Imbali, Pietermaritzburg were being charged. A 29-year-old resident said: &ldquo;When we pay R100, we only get electricity worth R60.&ldquo;When we asked officials why this was happening, we were told the other R40 went to other areas. &ldquo;How can this be happening when we live in a transit camp and don&rsquo;t have electricity meters or accounts?&rdquo; He said the problem started a few months ago when residents switched to prepaid electricity.Their protest was joined by residents from KwaMpumuza and KwaCaluza, who were experiencing the same problem. The resident said they would continue protesting until the Msunduzi Municipality changed its billing process and stopped ripping them off. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said 500 people blocked the road with burning tyres and rocks. &ldquo;Cops were sent to monitor the situation. No damage to property was reported and no cases were opened,&rdquo; he said. Councillor Dumisani Phungula told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Rather get a comment from the municipality because my ward is not the only one affected by the protest.&rdquo;A municipal official said mayor Themba Njilo was in a meeting.The SunTeam sent an SMS but it was not answered.The phones of the deputy mayor and municipal manager rang unanswered.
