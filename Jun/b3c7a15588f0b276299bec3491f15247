NONTUTHUZELO Matoti dreams of owning a house with an indoor toilet. The 63-year-old from Lower Crossroads in Cape Town said taking her 21-year-old disabled grandkid to the outside loo is a daily mission.&ldquo;I have to strip her naked before taking her to the toilet. I&rsquo;m old now and my arms are not as strong as they used to be,&rdquo; she said.The child&rsquo;s mum died in 2002, and she lives with her gogo in a tiny RDP.Nontuthuzelo was forced to quit her job to look after her grandkid.&ldquo;She is 21 years old and I don&rsquo;t like that people are able to see her naked. However, I don&rsquo;t have a choice because our toilet is outside. &ldquo;The toilet is also too small and it makes it difficult for me to undress her inside there,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;All I want is a house with an inside toilet. I am struggling,&rdquo; she said.According to Nontuthuzelo, her grandkid didn&rsquo;t cry after being born.&ldquo;The doctor gave her an injection to make her cry. After the injection, she cried non-stop and they gave her a pill to put her to sleep. &ldquo;When she eventually woke up, the doctor and nurses noticed that there was something terribly wrong with her. &ldquo;They told us that she was disabled,&rdquo; said the sad gogo.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame them but I believe that the injection and pills they gave her crippled her. &ldquo;Life would be easier if I could get a house with an indoor toilet.&rdquo;Sihle Ngobese, spokesman for Western Cape Social Development MEC Albert Fritz, said social workers will look into the case and determine what sort of assistance can be provided.&ldquo;I have also forwarded the case to our regional office for investigation and assessment,&rdquo; said Ngobese.Cape Human Settlements MEC Bongani Madikizela&rsquo;s spokeswoman Ntomboxolo Makoba-Somdaka said: &ldquo;Because the gogo has already benefited from a government housing subsidy, she cannot get another house.&ldquo;She must approach her local councillor for further assistance.&rdquo;
