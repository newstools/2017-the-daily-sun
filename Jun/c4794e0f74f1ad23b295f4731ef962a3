ELIZABETH Mahlangu (48) started the week with a cheerful heart as she left for work on Monday morning. Today she is recovering in hospital after being mauled by a vicious dog on her way to work. Elizabeth, from Garsfontein in Tshwane, said when she first saw the dog on her way to work, it looked adorable and peaceful. But in an instant it turned into a beast! It rushed towards her and started tearing her flesh. She said when she saw the dog running towards her, she knew that all hell was going to break loose. &ldquo;I tried to run but I couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;The next thing it started attacking me.&rdquo; She said she shouted for help but no one heard her. She was pushed to the ground and was frantically fighting off the dog when a man finally heard her shouts and rushed to rescue her. But by that time she&rsquo;d already been seriously injured. She said she didn&rsquo;t know who owned the dog. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who would let their vicious dog on the streets instead of locking it up.&rdquo; She was bitten on both arms and legs. &ldquo;My right leg is broken. Doctors are not sure if I will ever walk again,&rdquo; she said. Her brother, John Mahlangu (59), said Elizabeth was the breadwinner at home. Tshwane SPCA&rsquo;s Inspector Meshack Matlou said when a person is bitten by a dog they are at risk of contracting tetanus or even rabies. &ldquo;This can easily happen if the dog had not been vaccinated.&rdquo; He said Elizabeth should also go to her nearest police station to open a case.
