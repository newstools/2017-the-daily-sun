MY mum destroyed my life! But Thabiso Ramanamane (32) from Orange Farm, south of Joburg said it was time he stopped blaming his mum for the life he chose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time I took charge of my life. I want to support my son and wife, but I&rsquo;m unemployed,&rdquo; he said. Thabiso was convicted of murder and spent eight years in prison. He told Daily Sun that he was almost convicted again this year for a crime he didn&rsquo;t commit. &ldquo;It was a wake-up call. &ldquo;God has given me a second chance to live peacefully with other people. I&rsquo;ve forgiven my mum, even though she is nowhere to be found,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I was young my mum sent me to live with a white man on a farm.&ldquo;He used to abuse me. He&rsquo;d make me work the whole day without any food,&rdquo; he claimed.&ldquo;I ran away because I thought life would be better, but it only got worse.&rdquo; Thabiso said he was writing a book about his life.&ldquo;It talks about my journey.&rdquo; Thabiso said he was looking for a job and when he finds it, he&rsquo;ll hold on to it because he wants to change his life for the better.&ldquo;If anyone can help with a job, I&rsquo;d be the happiest father and husband. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t run away any more.&rdquo;
