SIZZLING news anchor MacFarlane Moleli allegedly has a wild side from hell. According to his alleged girlfriend, Lerato Phakathi, the cool, calm and collected personality has a tough time keeping “it” in his pants. The 23-year-old lass from Krugersdorp in Mogale City, west of Jozi, told the SunTeam MacFarlane also had a forked tongue. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>This as he allegedly lied about being single when “our relationship first started”. Said Lerato: “When our relationship started on 3 September last year, we were good. I really loved that man. We enjoyed every moment together.” But Lerato said trouble reared its ugly head after she’d done some digging around and discovered that she was part of a “love triangle”. She said matters were made worse when one of MacFarlane’s exes moved in with him. “Things were fine for three months, then in December, his first ex-wife moved in with him. MacFarlane told me nothing about it,” she said. “He started acting very strange. I would ask him everyday what was bothering him, and if we could talk about it.” But the news anchor’s lips remained shut, she said. This was until Lerato allegedly learned from one of his exes that his ex-wife had moved in with him. She said: “On 20 December, I questioned him and he admitted that his ex had returned. “But he said it was innocent because she was staying with him until she found her own place, since they have a daughter. “I was hurt and disappointed because I had been asking him if he stayed with her and he’d said no.” According to the disappointed lass, their affair then nose-dived after that confrontation. She said they started fighting daily because MacFarlane could neither chat nor call her when he was in his house. “The only time I could get hold of him was when his ex had left the house for work. When I confronted him about him being passive, he apologised,” Lerato said. “I did everything for that man, but he never appreciated it.” She said she was crushed after their latest incident last week, when she went to his house and found a dress, used condoms and pantyliners in the bin. “When I asked him in the car, he said that’s his house and he could do whatever he pleased there.” Sunday Sun is in possession of WhatsApp messages between Lerato and MacFarlane. Asked for comment, MacFarlane denied knowing Lerato. He said: “I take pictures with many people. There’s no such.”
