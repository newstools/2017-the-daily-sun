THE rising number of brutal murders of children in Eastern Cape has top politicians looking to a higher power for guidance. Yesterday about 1 000 Methodist Church members dressed in their red, black and white uniforms gathered in Tsolo, near Mthatha, for a prayer session.Premier Phumulo Masualle and social development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi were there, as well as bishops from the region.The faithful&rsquo;s prayers were desperate, asking God to intervene not just in the province but also in Mzansi&rsquo;s social and political problems.&ldquo;If Christians keep quiet in such a time of pain and turmoil, the world will really come crumbling down,&rdquo; said Bishop Thembinkosi Fandaleki.&ldquo;It is not in our culture to eat people. When we grew up, we thought cannibals were monsters and scary creatures. We never imagined that people living among us would become these monsters.&rdquo; He said he wrote a letter to the Libode Magistrates Court pleading that the three people accused of killing 11-year-old Liyema Dutywa not be granted bail, especially as one of the suspects is her father.Masualle thanked the church members for their support. He said it wasn&rsquo;t good that some pastors were doing terrible things in God&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;In Port Elizabeth some people are defiant, telling us to leave Daddy alone, even though he is facing serious charges,&rdquo; said Masualle. He was referring to Bishop Tim Omotoso, who was bust by the Hawks on charges of human trafficking and abusing women. The pastor was denied bail recently but has strong support from his church and is called Daddy by many women.Among the many horrific incidents that have gripped the province over the past months is the killing of Kamvelihle Ngala (4), allegedly by his 30-year-old uncle Mandisi Gwanya in Port St Johns.Gwanya allegedly chopped up his nephew and ate his body parts. He has been referred to undergo mental evaluation.
