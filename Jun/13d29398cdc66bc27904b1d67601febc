LEGENDARY producer and hitmaker Robbie Malinga left all his fans in a state of anxiety last week.&nbsp; They feared the worst after news came out &ndash; that their beloved artist had been admitted to a private hospital in Jozi.&nbsp; Robbie had been criss-crossing Mzansi, together with Idols winner Musa on what must have been an exhausting non-stop tour.&nbsp; The pair was performing their hit song Mthande, which has become a national anthem mostly at weddings.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has learnt that doctors have come up with a diagnosis for Robbie &ndash; he is suffering from anaemia, a deficiency of iron in his blood.&nbsp; Robbie could not be reached for comment, but his record label issued a statement.&nbsp; Speaking to the People&rsquo;s Paper, Universal Music spokesperson Dharam Sewraj confirmed the news.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;I can confirm that Robbie is in hospital and recovering very welll.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was admitted on Thursday and will be out of there soon. Doctors are keeping a close eye on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;His fans should not panic, but should pray for his speedy recovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must remember that Robbie is always on the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;And as a label, we&rsquo;re going to encourage him to rest from now on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has just completed working on his album and we believe it&rsquo;s time for him to take some time off to rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robbie has produced hit songs for the likes of Zahara, Ntando and Kelly Khumalo, among others.&nbsp; His close friend and former record label boss, TK Nciza, told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I want to wish Robbie a speedy recovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;I agree with what his label announced. He needs to rest because he has been all over the country in the last 18 months or so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
