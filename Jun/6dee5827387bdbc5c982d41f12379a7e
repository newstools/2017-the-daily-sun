This also bodes well for my two main distances."Emile Erasmus and Henricho Bruintjies finished second and third in 10.12 and 10.14, respectively, to finish off a podium sweep for South Africa.The 24-year-old Van Niekerk's dash was also an all-comers record in Slovenia which elevated him to No 6 on the season's list.Van Niekerk is already the only man to have broken the 10-second, 20-second and 44-second barriers in the 100m, 200m and 400m last year.He has four meetings prior to the much anticipated London World Championships in August.He will compete in the rarely-run 300m distance at the IAAF World Challenge meeting in Ostrava starting on Wednesday, June 28 - where he will attempt to break another record of Michael Johnson, following his 400m Rio Olympic triumph.He'll then participate in the IAAF Diamond League meetings in Lausanne on July 6 and Monaco on July 21.The 2017 World Championships will take place at London's Olympic Stadium from August 4-13.
