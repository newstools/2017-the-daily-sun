Addressing a small crowd outside the bank's branch at Ghandi Square in Jo'burg CBD today, BLF leader Andile Mngxitama said they gave ABSA five days to change their mind on their apparent refusal to pay back the money as recommended by the Public Protector."If they don't, BLF will mobilise society and shut down ABSA," warned Mngxitama. Mngxitama said they've written a letter to Maria Ramos, Chief Executive Officer of Barclays Africa Group Limited&nbsp; after the public protector has come out with her findings for the bank to pay up.He said Absa is one of those banks that benefited from the 26 billion which was stolen from the reserve bank."Today we are simply sending a warning shot, Absa must pay back the&nbsp; money or face a national shut down."On what will the money recovered from ABSA will be used for, Mngxitama said "This money, we want it for free education for the black children."But also part of this money, must come to us in the township to the unemployed black youth to create employment."EFF leader Julius Malema was in also in the firing line and was accused of having taken bribes in London."Juluis Malema is part of the problem. He said he was going to shut down Absa in 2015."He went to London, there the Queen kissed him and when he came back, he's mumbling."Mngxitama added, "And he's very tired from counting British pounds.""We don't fill stadiums, we fill minds."On the ANC, he said that the ruling party was scared of white people."The only man who's fighting in the ANC is president Zuma," he said.He also called on the ANC to remove all the accounts that government has with ABSA immediately."Gigaba don't worry about your suits, worry about the money that is in ABSA," he said while taking a shot at the Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba.He said ANC on its policy conference must come out with three resolutions which are: &nbsp;Land expropriation without compensation, Nationalisation of the Reserve Bank and a black bank and a state bank which is going to give people loans that are going to be interest free.
