MILLIONS&nbsp;of disadvantaged students will benefit from Standard Bank's Feenix.org platform.Standard Bank today launched Feenix.org, a platform for collecting funds from various people across the world for the funding of students at tertiary institutions.According to the interim CEO of Feenix.org, Jayshree Naidoo, the platform is proposed to support the poor and "missing middle" students.It will help students that should have been assisted by government institutions such as NSFAS but fell through the cracks of the systems.Naidoo says Feenix.org's goal is to raise over R17 million by the end of 2017.Research shows that in South Africa only 17% of the student population is covered by the available funds provided by government &nbsp;and 94% of the South African households that earn less than R600 000 need assistance in paying tertiary fees.There are estimates that by the end of 2017 over R35 billion worth of fees will be owed by families who can't afford to pay them. Feenix.org contributions are tax deductable, which means companies will improve their BEE score and individuals that contribute will get tax refunds.This initiative has come at a time when students for the past two years have been staging the #Feesmustfall protests across the country.Standard Bank has so far covered the set-up costs for Feenix.org &nbsp;and has committed to cover the total operating costs."Access to education remains a major challenge for so many people with ability, but who lack funds." Says Naidoo.&nbsp;Naidoo further explained that Standard bank has a history of making a difference and &nbsp;they want to ensure their skills are also used on the platform."The power of crowd-sourcing as a solution to boosting educational funding channel is taking off worldwide and we are excited to be able to take part in this exciting journey in SA."Applicants will not be required to pass with flying colours, to be funded by Feenix.org.Tebogo Ratsoma who is one of the lucky students to be funded by Feenix.org says she wouldn't have been able to pay for her tertiary tuition fees had it not been for Feenix.org.To apply students need to go to Feenix.org, register, &nbsp;upload their profile, and send a fee statement from the university.
