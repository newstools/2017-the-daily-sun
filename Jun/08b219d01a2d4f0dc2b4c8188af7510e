THE family of a popular funeral undertaker, Wilco Motlhatlhedi, who was gunned down three years ago, is living in fear. Their cars were set alight, two at their home and another at their office, in Vergenoeg, Kimberley on Friday morning.The family said they are afraid because Wilco was allegedly killed by a rival undertaker who may come back to finish what he started. Oswald Riet (49), the manager of the funeral parlour, said: &ldquo;Wilco&rsquo;s wife called me in the early hours of Friday morning to tell me that her car was in flames. &ldquo;She was with her two children and mother when the incident happened. She said she had heard a noise coming from outside her house and when she went out to investigate, saw flames coming from her VW Touareg. She said a few minutes later the fire had spread to her Chrysler.&rdquo; Oswald said neighbours tried to help them stop the fire but it was already too late to save the cars. &ldquo;A few minutes after I arrived at the house, I received another call from a neighbours who lives near the funeral parlour. They told me another Chrysler was on fire.&ldquo;I rushed there but I found it already burnt. Firefighters were at the scene, putting out the fire. &ldquo;We are all afraid and wonder if the suspects will strike again. &ldquo;We believe whoever is responsible for the fires wants to put us out of business.&rdquo; said Oswald.Captain Bashoabile Kale, a police spokesman, said: &ldquo;We are investigating a case of arson but no suspects have been arrested.&rdquo;
