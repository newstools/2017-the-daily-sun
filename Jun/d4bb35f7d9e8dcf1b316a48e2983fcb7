HER lesbian sangoma lover was in the news in Daily Sun in January when she refused to make vutha.But now Nomayeza Jwanqa (49) has been rushed to hospital with a burnt foot . . .She was attacked by vutha!Sangoma Siphiwe Mtshali (30) told Daily Sun that she believed evil people had sent the vutha to attack them.Nomayeza said the drama happened early last Thursday morning at the house of her mlungu bosses in Bainsvlei, Bloemfontein.&ldquo;I was asleep when I saw my late mother in my dreams, warning me to quickly wake up and run away as fast as I could,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When I opened my eyes, I saw fire at the foot of my bed. I jumped out and ran outside, screaming, as my right foot was still on fire and I couldn&rsquo;t put it the fire out.&ldquo;It suddenly stopped burning when my bosses showed up. By that time the whole house was engulfed in flames. &ldquo;When firemen arrived, all had been burnt to ashes. What shocked me was that the fire did not have smoke. It was vutha. I don&rsquo;t know who sent it.&rdquo;Siphiwe said she suspected the vutha was sent to destroy all the good things they stood for. She was in the news after she claimed her previous girlfriend&rsquo;s family wanted her to make vutha that would kill other members of the family. She declined to help.&ldquo;At the moment I&rsquo;m not in Bloemfontein. But as soon as I arrive, I will consult with the ancestors to find out what nearly killed my woman,&rdquo; said Siphiwe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ruling out the possibility that it was angry people who had wanted me to do evil things to innocent people. But they&rsquo;ll never succeed. Nomayeza and I will get married because we love each other.&rdquo;
