GATVOL train commuters set eight train carriages alight after delays of more than three hours at Cape Town Station on Monday night. Several shops were also looted and a Prasa car was overturned by angry commuters, leading to cops using stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd.Metrorail commuter Zukile Ndyalivane (35) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;After waiting for a train from 4pm, I started to panic at 7pm. There was just no explanation. &ldquo;The people who were supposed to help us said there were no train drivers and they didn&rsquo;t know what was going on.&rdquo; Marvin Visser said he went to Cape Town Station after being stuck at Ysterplaat. &ldquo;We have valid tickets but the service we receive is bad,&rdquo; he said. A 43-year-old owner of a cellphone shop which was looted said he was not angry with the commuters.&ldquo;I feel sorry for them. There were many delays and they were angry. Their anger had to be directed somewhere and unfortunately I suffered. Prasa should take responsibility for this,&rdquo; said the man. Metorail regional manager Richard Walker said the cars were burned minutes after trains started operating again following region-wide delays. &ldquo;The delays were as a result of defective electrical feeds. Between 2pm and 8pm, two of the four feeds were not functional, overloading the remaining two feeds, which tripped.&rdquo; Walker said commuters were offered alternative bus transport but many refused it. Fire and Rescue spokesman Theo Layne said four fire engines responded to the fire and no injuries were reported.
