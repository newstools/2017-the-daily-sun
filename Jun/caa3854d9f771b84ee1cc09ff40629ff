It&rsquo;s not the end of Hlaudi but the beginning.&rdquo; The famous pastor warned that if Hlaudi went down, a lot of people would go down with him . . . &ldquo;Hlaudi has helped a lot of people rise in their careers,&rdquo; said Mboro.&ldquo;If he goes down, many people will suffer too.&rdquo;Two weeks ago, Hlaudi was found guilty of misconduct and bringing the SABC into disrepute after holding an unauthorised press conference in April.
