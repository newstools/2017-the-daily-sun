AYANDA DAWETI (26) often has to pinch himself to see if it&rsquo;s really him living his dream!&nbsp;He&rsquo;s just bagged his first soapie role on e.tv&rsquo;s Scandal! and hopes for his name to be called among Mzansi&rsquo;s greatest actors.&nbsp; He plays 19-year-old Chuma Langa, the son of Siseko (played by Hlomla Dandala).&nbsp; Chuma and his sister, Xolile (played by Sivenathi Mabuya) have just arrived in Joburg from the Eastern Cape after news that their father has been unfaithful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chuma is a very privileged young man. He&rsquo;s gone to the best schools and is academically inclined but not at all flashy, as you&rsquo;d expect a rich kid to be.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s humble and just trying to understand why his dad cheated on his mum,&rdquo; said Ayanda. Born in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, the TV newbie said he loved playing Chuma and that&rsquo;s the only way he&rsquo;d be able to bring justice to his character.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m enjoying playing Chuma. We share similar moral values. But my personality is far more colourful than his.&nbsp; &ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t come from a privileged background like he does,&rdquo; said Ayanda, who started acting in community theatre in his home town.&nbsp; He told the People&rsquo;s Paper that being on set with the same legends he grew up watching was quite surreal for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was shaking on my first day, I mean I used to watch all these people and now here I am learning so much from them.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re great to work with and are always happy to give tips about the craft.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ayanda is also passionate about uplifting his community back home.&nbsp;&ldquo;I run a community development programme called Imbizo Emakhaya. It&rsquo;s an annual project that promotes localtalent in sports, entrepreneurship and the arts,&rdquo; he said.Catch Ayanda Daweti as Chuma on Scandal! weekdays at 7.30pm.&nbsp;
