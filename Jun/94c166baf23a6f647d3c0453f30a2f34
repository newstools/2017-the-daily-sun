AFTER giving the nation a big scare during his recent long jump event, lanky long jumper Luvo Manyonga will now take it easy.At the Diamond League Series in Stockholm, Sweden, last week, Manyonga looked like he had twisted his ankle during an awkward landing, but the injury was not too serious.Manyonga, who is coached by Neil Cornelius at the High Performance Centre at the University of Pretoria, leaped 8.36m to win his third Diamond League Series gold medal.His coach Cornelius is not willing to take any chances with the world&rsquo;s best long jumper this year.The Olympic silver medallist and SA long jump champion will feature in mid-July &ndash; his last event before the IAAF World Championships in London, in August.Since the beginning of the year, he has featured in more than six competitions and Cornelius insisted he won&rsquo;t suffer burnout at the big event.Cornelius said: &ldquo;Last year he did more than 12 events and we&rsquo;ll limit him to the same number this year.&ldquo;People need to understand we&rsquo;re pushing him hard because he has potential to be the best in the world, not just this year, but for the next five years.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fighter and is consistent at what he does. We&rsquo;re extra careful with him.&rdquo;Mzansi&rsquo;s long jumpers: Rushwal Samaai, who finished second behind Manyonga in Sweden with a jump of 8.29m, 2008 Olympic silver medallist Khotso Mokoena and Zarck Visser, are on form, heading to the London meeting.Cornelius also believes Mzansi will dominate the long jump event at the World Championships, with Manyonga leading the way with a gold medal.Cornelius told SunSport: &ldquo;We have an unbelievable talent in the long jump category in Mzansi and it&rsquo;s time we showed the world what we&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo;Manyonga is pushing hard to become the first jumper to break the 9m distance before the London event.
