JOSEPH Opondo drove into a roadblock on Saturday afternoon. The Metro police asked to see his driver&rsquo;s licence. He took out his Kenyan driver&rsquo;s permit and a certified copy of his South African traffic certificate. The cops were allegedly not impressed and accused him of driving with a fake licence. When Joseph tried to argue that the documents were legal, the police allegedly moered him!The 39-year-old Kenyan from Uitenhage, Nelson Mandela Bay said: &ldquo;I was told to get in my Quantum and they issued a fine.&ldquo;An officer asked what my name was and I told him it was on the documents. They told me this was not Kenya. They then beat me with a torch, pepper sprayed me and handcuffed me.&rdquo; Joseph asked to go to hospital as he was injured. &ldquo;Instead, the cops took me to KwaNobuhle Police Station,&rdquo; he said. He was released in minutes.&ldquo;I am trying to open a case against the seven men but no one is willing to help me. I am told the investigating officer is busy every time I go to the station,&rdquo; said Joseph. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said: &ldquo;Joseph must speak to the station commander, Colonel Dial Kettledas.&rdquo;
