After gaining entry, they allegedly stole TVs and home theatre systems.A resident told Daily Sun: &ldquo;There was an argument in my neighbour&rsquo;s yard before the whistle was blown. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been warned about a vehicle that roams our streets in search of houses to rob. &ldquo;Our plasma screen TVs kept getting stolen, so I&rsquo;m happy the thugs were attacked.&rdquo;Limpopo police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the residents cornered the suspected thief and assaulted him.
