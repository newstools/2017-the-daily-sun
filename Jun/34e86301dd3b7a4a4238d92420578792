BLACK Leopards wasted a great chance to increase their chances of winning the National First Division relegation/promotion play-offs when they drew goalless with Stellenbosch FC in their opening match at Thohoyandou Stadium, Venda yesterday.&nbsp; A win could have moved Lidoda Duvha from the bottom of the mini league table to occupy top spot and give them an advantage over Stellenbosch and Baroka.&nbsp;Although, the vocal home crowd that packed the venue intimidated the opposition, Leopards players seemed to have left their scoring boots at home as they wasted an avalanche of clear-cut scoring chances especially in the first half with striker Mwape Musonda the main culprit.&nbsp; The Venda side cruised in the hot weather while the Cape Town side struggled to cope with the conditions which forced them to defend deep in their own half as they resorted to counter attack football. Stellenbosch sufferd a huge blow in the 88th minutes when defender Diego Brown was given a red card.&nbsp; Stellenbosch were also desperate for a win having dropped two valuable points when they drew 2-2 with Baroka FC in their opening play-offs match played in Cape Town midweek.&nbsp; The teams are fighting for the remaining vacant spot in the PSL aiming to join National First Division champions Thanda Royal Zulu who won automatic promotion.&nbsp; Leopards finished the NFD season in second spot with 12 points behind Thanda, while Stellenbosch finished third to book the last play-off spot together with Baroka who finished 15th in the Absa Premiership ahead of relegated Highlands Park to get another chance to battle it out for survival.&nbsp; This is the third time Leopards are involved in the play-offs. They lost their first play-offs battle in 2007/08 season when they got relegated from the PSL after they lost to Bay United in the semifinal stage before the current mini league format was introduced in 2012.&nbsp; Lidoda Duvha had another chance to gain promotion via the stressful competition in 2015, but they were unlucky as they lost on goal difference to winners Jomo Cosmos.&nbsp; Leopards will now face Baroka in their next fixture at Polokwane&rsquo;s Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday (7.30pm).&nbsp; Baroka will also need to pull up their socks if they are to retain their top flight status.&nbsp; Only three PSL teams since the inception of the play-offs in 2004/05 season have managed to win the round robin competition.&nbsp;
