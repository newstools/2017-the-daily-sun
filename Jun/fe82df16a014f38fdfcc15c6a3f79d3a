THIS mother desperately needs a house for herself and her kids. Rita Nongudu (40) is renting a room in Green Flats, KwaNdokwenza, near Port Elizabeth. She is living with her six kids, including two sets of twins. They are crammed in like sardines and there is no privacy in the room.It&rsquo;s not a good place to raise children. The building is dirty and rubbish is not collected. Parts of the roof and walls are falling apart and sewage is leaking through broken pipes. Rita told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I am unemployed and battle to pay R350 a month for this room. &ldquo;I moved here in 2012 when I was pregnant with my last twins. I could no longer afford the R500 rent at the previous place.&rdquo;She said she had been applying for an RDP house without success. &ldquo;I first applied in 2009.&ldquo;When I went to ask in 2013 why I hadn&rsquo;t heard anything, I was told I was not on the waiting list. I then re-applied.&ldquo;Still I didn&rsquo;t get a house, so I applied again in 2015.&ldquo;The ward councillor then told me that he had seen my name on the list. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m still suffering in this old building.&ldquo;I want my RDP. I can&rsquo;t live like this all my life. &ldquo;I am worried that my children won&rsquo;t have a place to call their home.&rdquo;Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We are busy finalising the waiting list. &ldquo;We are going to start with old people and those who had been waiting for a very long time. &ldquo;Then we will allocate houses to orphans and disabled people.&ldquo;Rita must still wait for a while.&rdquo;
