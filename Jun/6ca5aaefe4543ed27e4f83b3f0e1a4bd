THE speed hump is there to ensure that pupils at the local school are safe when crossing the road.But the bakkie driver had no intention of slowing down . . . He lost control of the car when he overtook ahead of the speed hump!Pupils from Nyamande High School in Merry Pebble Stream near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, screamed as the car zig-zagged across the road. The bakkie rolled for 200m, leaving its occupants bleeding and lying scattered all over the road.The accident occurred on Tuesday afternoon, and it&rsquo;s the second to take place near the new hump in four weeks. In November, a pupil was killed while crossing the road on her way to school.The latest accident has scared pupils, who said they fear for their lives when they travel to school.Zanele Godi, a resident, told Daily Sun that the speeding bakkie failed to stop at the speed hump.&ldquo;We heard the school children who were at the back of the bakkie screaming,&rdquo; said Zanele.&ldquo;They jumped out of the bakkie as it spun out of control. If they hadn&rsquo;t jumped out, they would have been killed. &ldquo;The bakkie rolled many times. They would have been squashed to death if they were still in the vehicle.&rdquo;The pupils said they often have to be at school as early as 5am, and they no longer feel safe because vehicles don&rsquo;t stop at the speed hump.Police spokeswoman, Captain Duduzile Phiri, told the People&rsquo;s Paper that cops are investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving.&ldquo;The injured pupils and the driver were taken to a local medical facility for treatment,&rdquo; said Phiri.
