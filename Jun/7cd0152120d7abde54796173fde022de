IT&rsquo;S been close to two years since midfielder Bongani Zungu last donned the Bafana Bafana jersey. He last played in a World Cup qualifier against Angola in November 2015 in Durban where he was replaced by Kamohelo Mokotjo in the 1-0 victory. &nbsp; Injury and moving to a new club in Portugal left him on the sidelines but now he is back and eager to do the business. &nbsp; Zungu is part of the 25-man Bafana Bafana squad that has been selected to face Nigeria in the first match of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. He said: &ldquo;It feels good to be back. The camp is nice and I am enjoying every minute of it.&rdquo; The clash will be played on Saturday, 10 June 2017 at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo State, Nigeria. Kickoff is at 17h00 local time (18h00 SA Time) Zungu believe that Bafana have what it takes to beat Nigeria, the only need to stick to their plan in order to achieve the goal. He stated: &ldquo;We have the quality in the team and I believe we stand a good chance to beat them because they haven&rsquo;t been having a good run in recent times. If we stick to that plan I think we can beat anyone. I just hope the fans can rally behind the team and give us that oomph to perform because if our confidence is high, we can make things happen.&rdquo; Zungu said since he joined Victoria Guimaraes from Mamelodi Sundowns his game has grown by leaps and bounds. &ldquo;I am more matured now, the coaching is different from what I got here and I must say this &ndash; if there is any person I must credit for my doing well in Portugal is coach Pitso Mosimane. I have improved a lot since I got to Portugal. "They have a lot of big name players and playing in front of about 70-thousand fans against Benfica, as a player you get to grow,&rdquo; said Zungu.
