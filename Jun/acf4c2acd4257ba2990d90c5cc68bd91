THERE was jubilation in the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court on Friday when Magistrate Thandeka Mashiyi refused bail for Prophet Tim Omotoso.The 58-year-old prophet faces 22 charges of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault after several young girls from his church alleged that he had sexually assaulted them for years.During her judgment, Mashiyi said the leader of Jesus International Dominion church is a flight risk and may be able to influence and intimidate witnesses.She said he has no fixed address, is regarded as an illegal immigrant and has nothing tying him to South Africa.&ldquo;The function of this court is not pronounced on the merits of the case the accused is facing; however, I am taking into account that there is a public outcry about the explosion of these crimes of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault on young girls and women which are frowned upon by the community,&rdquo; said Mashiyi.&ldquo;I find that the accused&rsquo;s personal circumstance are common and not out of the ordinary. They do not constitute exceptional circumstances which justify his release on bail.&rdquo;Omotoso will remain behind bars until the case resumes on 12 July.National Public Authority spokesman Tsepo Ndwalaza said: &ldquo;We are happy that the accused has been denied bail.&ldquo;Justice can prevail because we have been saying our case is very strong based on the evidence that we have, but it will be stronger as we move forward.&rdquo;Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi said: &ldquo;This is a victory for society at large. We believe that the justice system will not fail us until the end of this case.&rdquo;Omotoso&rsquo;s congregants, who seemed disappointed, declined to comment.
