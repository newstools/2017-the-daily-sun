A GROUP of 53 gogos from Nelson Mandela Bay are doing their bit to help the needy. The gogos are former teachers, nurses and social workers.Pamela Maneli (67), of KwaMagxaki in Port Elizabeth, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;After we retired from our jobs, we met up and decided to exercise together to stay healthy. &ldquo;We came from professional backgrounds and decided to use our skills to give back to the community.&ldquo;In August 2014 we formed Kwakanya Lavela Ilanga, our non-profit organisation. &ldquo;We take money from our pension funds and use it to help the people in our neighborhood.&ldquo;Two weeks ago we visited the Ekuphumleni Old Age Home to donate groceries. &ldquo;Our next stop is Dora Nginza Hospital in Zwide township.&ldquo;We are busy knitting jerseys and buying clothes for needy babies.&ldquo;Our organisation is also looking for sponsors to help us because the demand is increasing every day.&ldquo;We can no longer cope with the amount of help needed.&rdquo; she said.Peter Monga, head of Ekuphumleli Old Age Home, said: &ldquo;The gogos from KwaMagxaki were kind enough to donate groceries to us. &ldquo;We appreciate their contribution.&rdquo;
