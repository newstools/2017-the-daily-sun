IF it were up to Bafana Bafana and Bidvest Wits skipper Thulani &ldquo;Tyson&rdquo; Hlatshwayo, he would choose an award that has eluded him for years at the eagerly awaited Premier Soccer League end of season awards at the Sandton Convention Centre on 10 July.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo, who made a clean sweep by winning the players&rsquo; player of the year and the player of the season accolades at the Clever Boys end of season awards ceremony on Wednesday, desperately wants to win the PSL defender of the season award.&nbsp;The 27-year-old Soweto born central defender has been nominated in three PSL awards categories the defender of the season, the PSL player of the season and the footballer of the season.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo, who joined the Clever Boys from Ajax Cape Town in 2014, made an emotional speech after he picked up his first award as a professional footballer.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo declared that this is his year to achieve the big awards in South African football.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo said: &ldquo;I cried because I had never won an award and coach Gavin Hunt made me who I am today tactically and my awareness in defence has improved too.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hunt has awaken the beast in me and personally there is only one award that I&rsquo;m looking forward to and that is the PSL defender of the season. It&rsquo;s really hard to be a defender because you are faced with a lot of creative players and you have to contain them.&rdquo;&nbsp;Hlatshwayo lost the award of his dream to former Kaizer Chiefs skipper and now SuperSport United defender Tefu Mashamaite and Mamelodi Sundowns star Thabo Nthethe in his past two nominations.&nbsp;He is hoping that it will be a third time lucky this time as he believes that this is his time to shine.&nbsp;Hlatshwayo said: &ldquo;I have been nominated three times in a row and I&rsquo;m hoping that this time I will win it. I don&rsquo;t think that I will win the footballer of the season award because I&rsquo;m not a creative player.&nbsp;In most cases creative players win that award I want the defender of the season award badly.&rdquo;
