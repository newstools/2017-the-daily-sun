KEBBY MAPHATSOE will now be addressed as Mr President. Maphatsoe was re-elected to lead&nbsp;Umkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) at its 5th national congress.&nbsp;He was elected unopposed.The constitution of the organisation was also amended to change Maphatsoe&rsquo;s title from chairperson to president.The controversial conference took place under a dark cloud with Maphatsoe&rsquo;s deputy Teenage Monama, general secretary Dumisani Nduli and his deputy Tshidiso Paka distancing themselves from the event. The MKMVA also clashed with former senior leaders of the ANC's liberation army, who called themselves the MK Council.The grouping, led by former MK chief of staff Siphiwe Nyanda, wanted a joint conference.They said one of the reasons behind their attempted intervention was to assist the ANC in changing its downward path.Others said they did not want to see the 105 liberation movement die under their watch.They abandoned this bid last week, saying participation would be a futile exercise.The MKMVA has also been dogged by claims that the conference would be attended by bogus members, who are mostly too young to belong to the liberation army but Maphatsoe insists that all who attended had the right to be there."All comrades who were here are verified members of Umkhonto WeSizwe," said Maphatsoe.'President'&nbsp;Maphatsoe, in explaining the amendment to his position, said the idea was initially rejected by former president Kgalema Motlanthe, then secretary general of the ANC."When we were here in our first constitution we spoke of a president, but because the ANC was running the conference, comrade Motlanthe said you were an association, you can't have a president and you can't have an SG," said Maphatsoe.He added that the idea also failed to find expression in the 2012 conference but was unopposed at plenary this weekend.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/its-president-kebby-maphatsoe-re-elected-unopposed-20170611
