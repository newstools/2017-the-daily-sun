THE pastor claimed to see the 18-year-old girl failing her matric and getting sick. The &ldquo;man of God&rdquo; offered to pray and cleanse her. But today, the girl is pregnant, allegedly with the pastor&rsquo;s child. And the man has vanished!The girl said the prayers took place at her home in Casteel, Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga. The girl said she met the pastor in January. She said: &ldquo;From the moment he saw me, he told me he had a vision that evil people were making my life a living hell. He said these people wanted to see me sick and fail my matric. I believed him as I had been having headaches and stomach aches. He offered to come and pray for me at home.&rdquo;She said the moment he arrived at her house, the pastor sent her mum and siblings away. &ldquo;He offered me &lsquo;holy&rsquo; water and stripped me naked while rubbing my body with ointment. I felt dizzy and weak. &ldquo;He then pulled down his pants and started to rape me. When he was finished he warned me not to tell anyone,&rdquo; she said.The girl&rsquo;s mum (44) said she also drank the &lsquo;holy&rsquo; water left behind by the pastor. &ldquo;I immediately felt weak and dizzy. I fell into a deep sleep.&rdquo; Captain Mpho Nonyane said a case of rape had been opened. Anyone with information about the pastor is asked to contact Warrant Officer Evans Mashego on 082 469 2940 or 013 795 8038.
