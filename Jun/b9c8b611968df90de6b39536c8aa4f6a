SHE was sitting in the waiting room before the start of her interview at the hospital, having earlier sent in her CV and qualifications. Lebo Mokgobu (20) wanted to be a cardiologist but she won&rsquo;t be doing operations any time soon, because she was bust for fraud.Hawks pounced on the fong kong doctor as she sat in the waiting room after it was found that her qualifications were all fake!Lebo, who was applying for a cardiology position at Pietersburg Hospital in Polokwane, Limpopo, that would have seen her handle medical cases relating to heart problems, appeared before the Polokwane Court on Wednesday where she was sentenced.Hawks spokesman Matimba Maluleke said Lebo was charged with fraud and sentenced to three years in prison, with no option of a fine.Maluleke said it was discovered that Lebo used fake US cardiologist&rsquo;s certificates to apply for the position and that she didn&rsquo;t even have a matric. The position requires candidates to have completed a three-year specialisation course in cardiology on top of their physician&rsquo;s qualification. Health spokesman Derrick Kganyago said the department welcomed the court&rsquo;s sentence as it would send a strong message to any other fraudulent doctors.&ldquo;Our advice is simple: if you want to be a doctor just go to a medical school and get the necessary qualifications. &ldquo;The department will remain vigilant against any more chance takers and will make sure they are brought to book.&rdquo;
