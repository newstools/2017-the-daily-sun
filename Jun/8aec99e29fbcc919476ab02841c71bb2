The wife was also a cop.  Neighbours say the unhappy couple fought all the time. A neighbour told Daily Sun: “They use to call each other all sorts of names.  “The ugly fights often got out of hand and they would smash all the windows.” Another neighbour said: “Those two were always at each other’s throats.  “They didn’t care who was watching or listening. All they did was fight.” Relatives of the couple were too shocked to talk to Daily Sun. Police spokeswoman Colonel Thandi Mbambo said the man was a detective constable at Thaba Nchu cop shop. “His wife was stationed at Boithuso Police Station in Botshabelo.  “At this stage, we cannot reveal the names of the dead cops because we could jeopardise the investigation.  “The last time the male cop was seen alive was when he was on night duty the previous day,” she said.
