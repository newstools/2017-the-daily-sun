FOR almost a week the Amatikulu River refused to give up Sihle Nxasana&rsquo;s body.Villagers camped out next to the river to support Sihle&rsquo;s family as they kept praying for his return. The grieving family finally found relief when the 29-year-old man&rsquo;s body was found floating on the water on Saturday.Residents of KwaWangu Village in Amatikulu, on KZN&rsquo;s North Coast, also returned home to help prepare for his funeral. The bodies of Sihle and his Mozambican friend, who cannot be named until his family have been notified, were both found on Saturday after they had drowned on Monday. They had been fishing with two friends. Sihle&rsquo;s mum Theni Mfeka (67) said even though she was feeling the pain of losing her son, she was happy that she would be able to put him in a dignified burial place. &ldquo;I was praying that the river gives him up. In our culture it is very important that the dead be given a final resting place,&rdquo; said the gogo. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: &ldquo;I can confirm that the two men were pulled out of the Amatikulu River and two inquest dockets were opened at Nyoni Police Station.&rdquo;
