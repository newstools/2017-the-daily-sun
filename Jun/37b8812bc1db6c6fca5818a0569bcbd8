The lock on the door was jammed and I couldn’t open it.“I yelled for help, as I was choking on the smoke. “My body was on fire and I had already sustained injuries from the explosion. “Before I collapsed, I threw some valuables out of the window, one of them was my passport as it had my work permit in it.”Kwaku was admitted to the Hillbrow Clinic and later transferred to Chris Hani Baragwanath’s Burn Unit. He was later taken to MediCross Clinic in Centurion.He suffered third degree burns to his arms and face and extensive damage to his lungs.The shooting of Deleterious Machismo has been put on hold indefinitely.One of the movie’s leading stars “Dezry Kay” (real name Desiree Kekana), said it was sad to see what had happened Kwaku.“We wish him a speedy recovery, as he’s one of the valuable actors in the movie,” Dezry Kay said.
