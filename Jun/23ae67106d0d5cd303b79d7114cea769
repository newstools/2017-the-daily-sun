Government remains committed to adhering to the set expenditure ceiling while maintaining a stable path of our debt portfolio." Zuma said in a statement in December 2015.Zuma’s decision to appoint Van Rooyen was met with wide criticism, and within days he bowed to pressure and appointed Pravin Gordhan to replace Van Rooyen.Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, were later axed in a dramatic Cabinet reshuffle in March this year, which saw the appointment of former home affairs minister, Malusi Gigaba, as the new finance minister.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/former-finance-minister-nene-never-heard-from-zuma-since-being-axed-20170601
