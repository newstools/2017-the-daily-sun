IT IS a primary school where the kids should be learning their ABC, but instead they&rsquo;re outside, protesting. The children, parents and teachers of Fleurhof Primary School in Soweto yesterday carried signs calling for clean water and flushing toilets.A crowd gathered outside the school to raise their concerns over the horrible conditions pupils had to suffer.Teachers and pupils told Daily Sun they didn&rsquo;t want to be at the &ldquo;rotten school&rdquo; any more. The school is built near a dam and since the classrooms are made from containers and corrugated iron, they are extremely cold.To add to their suffering, there is only dirty water for the children to drink and buckets for toilets.The angry crowd told the SunTeam the school was established about five years ago and the department of education promised that a proper structure would be built.&ldquo;That has not happened,&rdquo; said the school&rsquo;s SGB chairman, Nathan Opperman.He said that everything was falling apart at the school and that it had become a playground for thugs.&ldquo;We want the department of education to fix this or send our kids to a new, better school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are gatvol. We&rsquo;ve been writing to the MEC but we got no response. We even tried to call him.&rdquo; The Gauteng Department of Education received R40 billion yesterday to boost education. MEC Panyaza Lesufi confirmed the allocation when he delivered the budget vote speech at the provincial legislature.He said the department would focus on the acceleration of proper education in the province and on building more infrastructure.
