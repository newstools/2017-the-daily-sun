KHUNJULWA Tabasa from Khayelitsha is enjoying the fruit of the small business she started in 2010.The mum of three (42) told Daily Sun the shisa nyama she started with only R200 has grown a lot.&ldquo;I took a little from my children&rsquo;s grant money and decided to start a small business instead of waiting for my grant every month.&rdquo; Her R200&rsquo;s worth of meat sold out the first day. The second day she bought meat for R300 and then for R500. She now buys stock according to demand.&ldquo;My three children do not sleep on empty stomachs or go to school without food. This business has changed our lives.&rdquo;The longer she has stayed in business, she more popular her meat has become and she now has lots of regular customers, including taxi drivers and train commuters.&ldquo;The place I sell from is strategic. I didn&rsquo;t think about it, but only realised later I am close to Nolungile train station as well as the Site C taxi rank. These are busy areas.&rdquo; Khunjulwa&rsquo;s shisa nyama has become her source of income. She relies on it and works there almost every day.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always here but it doesn&rsquo;t mean I always get lots of money. At times things are slow.&rdquo; She sells mostly pork for R12 to R20, depending on the size.Xolile Mbanjwa (37) always buys his meat from Tabasa&rsquo;s stall. He has been buying there since 2011 and said: &ldquo;She braais it very well and knows her spices. That&rsquo;s why I always come to buy from her.&rdquo;
