BRIAN Molefe has to go and he has to go now!That was the order from the inter-ministerial committee that yesterday told the Eskom board to cancel its decision to re-appoint former CEO Brian Molefe.State Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown said as soon as the board informs Molefe about this decision, he will no longer be CEO. &ldquo;I will meet the board to advise them to cancel the decision. I plan to appoint an acting CEO in the next 48 hours,&rdquo; she said.Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha headed the committee. &ldquo;It will be in the best interests of government, Eskom and the country that the minister directs the board to cancel the decision to reappoint Molefe as CEO of Eskom.&rdquo; He said the committee welcomes the minister&rsquo;s decision to deal with matters at the annual general meeting.Brown said the board would decide if Molefe will get a payout. Board chairman Ben Ngubane has said firing Molefe may cost Eskom more than the R30 million retirement package previously mentioned.Brown said the board will discuss issues around the contract, as well as the package. Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said the events of the past three weeks had caused government harm. &ldquo;It caused a lot of reputational damage to Eskom and even to the minister. Our decision is not a true reflection of Molefe&rsquo;s capabilities,&rdquo; he said, insisting that Molefe served in his earlier positions with distinction.
