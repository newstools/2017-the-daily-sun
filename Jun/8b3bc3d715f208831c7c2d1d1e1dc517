THERE seems to be no end in sight for the mortuary strike. For the past three weeks, there has been chaos as forensic pathologists have downed their tools to protest against their working conditions, their salaries and equipment shortages. The situation has led to bodies piling up and many families have been unable to collect their loved ones&rsquo; bodies for burial. Khabo Ramakgakga from Botswana said her family had been stuck in Mzansi while waiting for her sister&rsquo;s body. &ldquo;We have been waiting since last week. We were supposed to take the body home by now and the whole family is here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to go home so we can get back to our lives but we can&rsquo;t do anything before the body is released.&rdquo; Members of the Masibi family from Dobsonville, Soweto said they had been unable to bury their father for three weeks. The strike has especially affected the Muslim community as Islam requires the dead to be buried soon after they die.Yusuf Sayed, an imam from Lenasia, south of Joburg, said: &ldquo;Some say within 24 hours but basically the rule is as soon as possible.&ldquo;We are having trouble with a burial that was supposed to happen last week. &ldquo;The body is stuck in Diepkloof.&rdquo; Abbas Sayed of Saaberie Chishty, which provides burial services to Muslims, said soldiers had been sent to assist but this was only in Hillbrow, Joburg.Gauteng Health Department spokesman Prince Hamnca said his department was in talks with stakeholders and would come up with a solution very soon.
