The community of Joko Tea squatter camp in Lethabong, Vaal, south of Joburg, realised some residents were in desperate need of things other residents no longer needed.So the kasi people decided to host an auction, which they now want to run every few weeks.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvywtAR6SpsXLAPJE8HKGzN-HygAPfjmKSlpKCE_xzWrgW92C4x2Oh2Qg-Cy6jhxYcOtjOhMcGky2GHglS2WzmLYz9UcI_pcQh3zRb7C2zkD8oRX6DFuCU-L0tsmCYhD9ywZcISjgZzmSBmd5k1enbR6Z27vKFDjqdGGKEEsex8SfSk931DR6B158osr0r2kdbqFuc57lRwSB6t6w-A3vyqJC4Jyc97drSMVVzl9ggqd6eM2iq_aviWYypiw6oRzGzjXQEsCX_4fG0MsBWLqgObYxYLACY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzP5U9Y73wOmaEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

They line up all the goods, from clothes to cutlery and books, and items are sold to the highest bidder.The community said it has reduced poverty and they no longer have to spend too much money on the things they need.The residents have no electricity and rely on paraffin to go about their daily tasks.One happy buyer, Tshepiso Mhlaba (42), said the auction really made a huge difference. “I bought slippers and two towels for only R20. If I had gone to the shops they would have cost more than R300,” said Tshepiso.Pontsho Montsho (45), another customer, got a motorcycle helmet and a protective jacket, even though he doesn’t own a bike.“The top looked nice and warm. I will use the helmet when I get a bike. “I got all these things for R40,” he said.Pontsho said he bought school shoes for his son for only R10.It is not yet clear when the auction started, but it is the second time it has been held.
