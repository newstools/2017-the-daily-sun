BAFANA Bafana defensive kingpin Ramahlwe &ldquo;Rama&rdquo; Mphahlele can&rsquo;t wait to lock horns with Nigeria&rsquo;s star strikers.Bafana face the Super Eagles in the opening 2019 African Cup of Nations qualifier in Uyo on Saturday. The Kaizer Chiefs defender, who was one of the few Amakhosi players to shine in a disappointing PSL season, says he is excited about the prospect of pitting his skills against those of players such as Manchester City striker Kelechi Iheanacho, Arsenal starlet Alex Iwobi and the classy Leicester City duo of striker Ahmed Musa and speedy midfielder Wilfred Ndidi.Said Rama after Bafana&rsquo;s final training session at the FNB Stadium prior to leaving for Uyo yesterday: &ldquo;They have good players and play in a bigger league. It is a big challenge for me &ndash; and I&rsquo;m up for it. Playing against those type of players will bring out the best in me.&rdquo;But Rama admitted it would be difficult: &ldquo;We need to defend well and bury our chances.&rdquo;&rsquo;He said the players were fighting for their places under new head coach Stuart Baxter: &ldquo;We will be on high alert as we want to impress the new coach and get called back for the next game. We want to go to Nigeria and get a positive result. &ldquo;We will have a couple of sessions in Nigeria to polish up our game and hope on the day our plan works out on the pitch.&rdquo;Baxter is expecting his players to put their bodies on the line but added that mental attitude was vital.He explained: &ldquo;We have to be mentally focused. We tended in the past to concede goals late in matches. That&rsquo;s something the players and I have discussed. &ldquo;We need to concentrate for 90 minutes and beyond &ndash; even if it goes on for an added six minutes, we have to be mentally alert.&rdquo;Baxter said the first 20 minutes would be crucial: &ldquo;That is the period in which we hope to frustrate them. If we keep them quiet the crowd will get on their backs and that will be to our advantage.&rdquo;The coach said he had watched all Nigeria&rsquo;s recent matches: &ldquo;They are rebuilding. They have some top class stars in the squad as well as a lot of promising younger players. &ldquo;The big question will they weld together? I hope not. We&rsquo;ll do our best to make sure they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;He conceded his plan would revolve around using Bafana&rsquo;s speed and hitting the Super Eagles on the counter-attack. His only worry as they left OR Tambo Airport yesterday was striker Kermit Erasmus. The French bases striker is suffering from a stomach bug.Said the coach: &ldquo;Kermit is our only concern. Hopefully it will clear up. &ldquo;Whether he is fit could affect my game plan and team selection.&rdquo;Meanwhile Baxter confirmed his side would meet Zambia in a friendly international at Moruleng Stadium next Tuesday (7pm).
