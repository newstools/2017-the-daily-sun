SASSA CEO Thokozani Magwaza yesterday told parliament the South African Post Office has agreed to take over the distribution of grants. Magwaza said the new service provider was expected to be on board by November and had a wide network of branches, enabling it to reach far into rural areas. He said one of the many advantages of using the Post Office was that it had already established a pay channel and had experience of working as a bank. However, there was an issue with data being in the hands of Cash Paymaster Services, the private company currently distributing grants. This was a concern as Sassa lost a court case against the company over the control of data. Magwaza said they planned to appeal the decision in the Constitutional Court. Another issue that needs to be dealt with was deductions being made from grant beneficiaries. Sassa said more than 129 000 complaints had been reported since 2015. Magwaza said they were looking forward to dealing with complaints in-house so beneficiaries could receive all their money and the process could be fast tracked. MPs asked Magwaza about an outstanding R1,1 billion in profits Cash Paymaster Services is supposed to hand over to the government. He said the issue would be dealt with when their contract ended in April. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini said the portfolio committee should call the company to inquire about the data issue. Rose Capa, the social development portfolio committee chairwoman, said the Post Office must come to the committee and explain their position to avoid future confusion.
