When popular actor Christopher Kubheka died last week, many believed he had killed himself.However, the family of the actor, best known for playing Gunman on SABC1'S Yizo Yizo, kept quiet.Yesterday at his funeral the 49- year old's uncle broke the silence and confirmed he had ended his own life and died a very sad man.Speaking to mourners at the funeral service &ndash; held at Umthombo Wolwazi Multi-Purpose Hall in Dobsonville, Soweto &ndash; Gunman&rsquo;s uncle Musawenkosi Khanyile said his nephew died a heartbroken man. &ldquo;He was miserable in his relationship, we&rsquo;ve been told. But no one wants to talk about it,&rdquo; claimed Musawenkosi. &ldquo;The truth needs to be told. Gunman was not happy at all. He was in an abusive relationship.&rdquo; He said he had himself once been in an abusive relationship, so he understood how difficult it must have been. &ldquo;When a man is in an abusive relationship, he doesn&rsquo;t say anything. But Gunman will speak. He will reveal the details of his death,&rdquo; he said. He said he was certain his nephew would tell the truth, as there had been a similar death in the family in KZN. &ldquo;That person spoke in the form of dreams and the truth came out eventually,&rdquo; he said. He said the family had heard that Gunman wanted to leave his home. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t and he died. God will reveal the truth,&rdquo; said Musawenkosi.A relative from KZN, who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, told mourners: &ldquo;Gunman met the woman he was with through me. They were all in KZN and soon they were exchanging numbers. I regret that.&rdquo; She said Gunman used to visit KZN to see his children who lived in the province. &ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t anymore. He couldn&rsquo;t even meet his friends. He was trapped,&rdquo; she said. A number of celebs attended the funeral, including actors Menzi Ngubane, Lillian Dube and Thembi Nyandeni. Lillian spoke about her own battle with depression, saying: &ldquo;It got to me once and I nearly killed myself.&rdquo; Some of Gunman&rsquo;s many children later danced on stage for mourners to celebrate his life. His daughter Khanyisile said: &ldquo;He was happy and wanted us to be happy, and that&rsquo;s why we won&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo; Gunman&rsquo;s friends and neighbours described him as a responsible man. Ernest Msibi, who played Chester in the TV drama Yizo Yizo, said it was sometimes difficult to be around Gunman as he made him laugh so much his stomach ached. Gunman was found dead at his house in Soshanguve, Tshwane, last Monday. He was buried at Avalon Cemetery.
