MADALA Noko Moakamedi, who hadn&rsquo;t been home for a long time, sprung a surprise on his family . . . He turned up unexpectedly &ndash; with a new, blushing bride in tow! The unemployed pensioner, father of two and grandfather of five apparently returned home in Alexandra after a year&rsquo;s absence.He and his new makoti had been shacked up in Orange Farm, south of Joburg.On his return, Noko (80) told his family he was now married, and they started questioning him about the new makoti&rsquo;s background.The family was furious because they knew nothing about the wife, or why the marriage had happened without them knowing. Speaking to Daily Sun, the madala&rsquo;s niece Mpho said: &ldquo;In our culture, people don&rsquo;t just get married. Families meet and take time to know each other. We&rsquo;re questioning why she&rsquo;s hiding her family from us?&rdquo;Gogo Anna Moakamedi (77) confirmed that she&rsquo;s married to Noko.She said: &ldquo;My family lives in Kimberley. The only person I consider my family is my husband, Noko.&rdquo; The madala said he met Anna in Meadowlands, Soweto, and that it was love at first sight!&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her family and I&rsquo;ve never met them. But that doesn&rsquo;t bother me,&rdquo; a defiant Noko told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;The reason I married Anna without my family&rsquo;s involvement is that we don&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s approval.&rdquo;
