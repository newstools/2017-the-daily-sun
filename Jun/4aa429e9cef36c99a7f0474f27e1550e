KAIZER Chiefs will bounce back stronger than ever next season.That was the promise from star midfielder Siphiwe &ldquo;Shabba&rdquo; Tshabalala yesterday speaking after he won his second Absa Premiership Goal of the Month award for his strike against SuperSport United.Said Shabba: &ldquo;We failed the last two seasons to win any silverware. There&rsquo;s no way Chiefs can go three seasons without winning anything. It&rsquo;s back to the drawing board. We will sit down in the off-season and fix our mistakes. &ldquo;We have learned our lesson.&rdquo; Tshabalala (32) was one of the few Amakhosi players who could hold their heads high after a dismal season that saw their trophy cupboard empty and the side finishing fourth in the league. Added Shabba: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit embarrassing getting accolades when the team does badly. &ldquo;I have won two Goal of the Month awards but I&rsquo;m a team player and the fact that we failed as a team to do well this season has overshadowed everything.&rdquo;He said it would be tougher next season but added: &ldquo;I fell in love with Chiefs. I joined the club to win trophies just like the other players. &ldquo;Expectations are high when you play for Chiefs. It&rsquo;s going to be tougher next season but we are definitely going to bounce back.&rdquo;Meanwhile Tshabalala said he would be honoured to made a comeback to play for Bafana Bafana after winning 88 caps. New national head coach Stuart Baxter is an admirer of Shabba and said he would consider the crafty midfielder following his performances this season. Shabba said: &ldquo;I would be honoured to get another call-up for Bafana. But I would not be bitter if it did not come as there are about 300 players who are available and I understand the situation.&rdquo; Baxter said her would consider older players like Tshabalala and former Chiefs defender Morgan Gould who had a superb season at SuperSport United if and when the situation called for their experience.
