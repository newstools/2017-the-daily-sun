He ordered her to undress.&ldquo;The cops arrived to find him raping me. I trusted him because I knew him. I never dreamt he would rape me.&ldquo;I thank that cellphone for saving me. Who knows what he might have done after he raped me?&rdquo;Police spokesman Captain Thabo Sibuyi said the man will appear at the Springs Magistrates Court soon on a charge of rape.He said: &ldquo;We would like to warn women not to go anywhere with men without being accompanied by their friends. &ldquo;It is risky, and some men will take advantage of them.&rdquo;
