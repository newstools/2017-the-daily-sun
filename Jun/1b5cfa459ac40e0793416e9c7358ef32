BIKERS and Gauteng government took to the streets yesterday to make a stand against violence. The portfolio committee on community safety and the Rainbow Mzansi Bikers&rsquo; Organisation joined forces on a Bikers Breakfast Run, from Southgate Mall to Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown, Soweto. Committee chairman Sochayile Khanyile told Daily Sun: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important that we take a stand against the gender-based violence in our society.&ldquo;We must all take a stand to curb this illness that has found its way into our beautiful country.&rdquo; Khanyile said the family of the late Karabo Mokoena, who was killed in April, allegedly by her boyfriend, was also part of the initiative. He said the family supported the initiative to curb violence against women and children, and Karabo&rsquo;s mum called for everyone to actively take a stand against gender-based violence.&ldquo;Their message was simple : people should not wait until it happens to them.&rdquo; Along the route, the bikers stopped at the Baragwanath Taxi Rank and at the Maponya Mall, to create awareness and talk to the commuters.&ldquo;We are bringing awareness, not only to the taxi drivers but to passengers as well. &ldquo;There have been incidents involving taxis &ndash; Quantum hijackers and rapes,&rdquo; said Sochayile. &ldquo;We also stopped at Maponya Mall to talk to the shoppers.&rdquo; He said that the cops must work with communities. &ldquo;Members of our communities must be able to immediately report any suspicions of violence or crime. &ldquo;We call on the cops to be actively involved in this fight,&rdquo; Sochayile told the People&rsquo;s Paper. According to Sochayile, the aim of the campaign was to mobilise men to become protectors of women and children in the gender-based violence that has affected the country badly.
