LEGENDARY music producer Sello “Chicco” Twala has allegedly turned down DJ Clock’s offer to be in his new music video. Sunday Sun can today reveal that DJ Clock approached Chicco to have him featured in a music video for their hit song, Saba Kufa.According to insiders, the I Miss You Manelo hitmaker refused to be part of the video. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>He was said to have argued that the song, which he allegedly wrote, had been badly remixed for the music video – and this without his approval.A source, who is close to the situation, said Chicco was so agitated by DJ Clock’s remix that he wanted nothing to do with the song.“What angered him was that there were no changes he could make as DJ Clock had already gone ahead and released the video before Chicco had a chance to assess its quality.”Saba Kufa is one of the most popular dance tracks, and has been on high rotation on many radio stations.A second source claimed: “One of Chicco’s employees gave DJ Clock the song to remix. But Chicco told him he wanted someone who could remix the song properly.”Another source said: “Chicco is a music genius, who made people like the late Brenda Fassie and Yvone Chaka Chaka. He pays attention to every detail.”A fourth source said: “DJ Clock’s big mistake was to show the video to Chicco after its release, and Chicco couldn’t do anything about it.“When Chicco told him the video was a badly-mixed version of Saba Kufa, DJ Clock talked back, arguing that many fans loved the song. Then, Chicco told DJ Clock that if people liked the song, he must continue the release, but without him.”Chicco refused to comment on the matter, but said: “I’m not interested in talking about this issue.”DJ Clock could not be reached for comment, but his manager Lebo Nqolobe said: “There’s been a delay as the song is not a typical video that can be shot at a shisanyama. There was a delay, as we are working on the concept.”
