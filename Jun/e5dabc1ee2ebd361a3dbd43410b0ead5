THE family was fast asleep but at midnight something shocking and unexpected happened.According to Elizabeth Matlala (45) from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni they smelt smoke and started coughing. As they woke up, they saw a big light coming from the sitting-room.Their house was on fire!&ldquo;We were woken by smoke in the house. We rushed outside and saw that the house was on fire. We screamed for help,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.She added that community members came to assist after hearing their screams.&ldquo;People broke down the doors and tried to save some of the items in the house. The water hoses couldn&rsquo;t reach the roof as the fire was intense. &ldquo;Finally, emergency services arrived but the fire had already damaged the whole house. &ldquo;We thank God our lives were spared, although we don&rsquo;t have a roof over our heads,&rdquo; said Elizabeth.She said they didn&rsquo;t know where the fire came from as every appliance was switched off. Whoever sent the vutha must tell us why,&rdquo; she said.The family now needs help to get back on its feet. Traditional healer Mahlinza Dlamini said evil people could be behind the fire.&ldquo;The family must seek help from an inyanga who will send the evil fire back to its owner.&rdquo;
