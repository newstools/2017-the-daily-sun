PARENTS are angry about a broken JoJo water tank next to the fence of a school. This comes after the leg of a seven-year-old grade 1 pupil, Oyintanda Plaatjie, was broken when he fell off the tank while playing. His mum, Phumeza Pongoma (47), said the boy was carried home by his friends from Magqabi Primary School in Khayelitsha on Thursday. &ldquo;He was in a lot of pain. I took him to hospital and they said his leg was broken.&rdquo; Phumeza said the JoJo was used by gardeners at the school, but it had not been in use for years and had become a safety hazard. The boy&rsquo;s dad, Nceba Plaatjie (58), who is also the local chairman of the South African National Civic Organisation, said: &ldquo;I went to the school the following day and told the principal to remove the tank. He promised to remove it, but it is still there. &ldquo;The principal had not even told the SGB or district education department about the tank.&rdquo; Principal Siphiwo Hoho said he was shocked that the parents of the boy had approached the media. &ldquo;I told the dad that our health and advisory committee deal with such matters.&ldquo; I told him to speak to the advisory committee about the tank.&rdquo;
