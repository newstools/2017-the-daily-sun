THE Mthembu family are in anguish. It has almost been a month since Siphamandla Mthembu (28), their relative, left home to see his two-year-old son for the first time in Mtwalume on the south coast of KZN. He has not been seen since then, and the mother of his child said he did not make it to her house. Zanele Mthembu (33) from CC section of Umlazi, south of Durban, said her brother was looking forward to seeing his son. He had not seen his child since the boy was born.Siphamandla had promised to be back soon as he had to go to work the next day.On 21 May he left home in a cheerful mood as a relative gave him a lift to Inanda Taxi Rank. &ldquo;He was going to catch a taxi from there to Mtwalume and was so looking forward to seeing his child and the mother of his kid. &ldquo;The relative said he dropped him off at the rank,&rdquo; said Zanele. She said Siphamandla was meant to return that evening but did not show up.&ldquo;We just assumed he decided to come back on Monday morning and go straight to work. &ldquo;However, we became worried when he had not returned by Monday evening.&ldquo;We called the mother of his child to check if he was on his way back, only to learn he never made it there,&rdquo; said Zanele. She said they started to search for him, but none of his friends knew where he was. They even searched local hospitals and mortuaries, but to no avail.&ldquo;We consulted a sangoma who told us he would be back soon. &ldquo;But there is still no sign of him. We just want him back, dead or alive,&rdquo; said a devastated Zanele. KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala is appealing to anyone with information to contact Warrant Officer Darrin on 031 325 4284 or 079 514 5189. Gwala said: &ldquo;Siphamandla was last seen wearing skinny khakhi pants and red takkies.&rdquo;
