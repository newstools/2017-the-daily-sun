AS THE train from Westonaria moves towards Joburg every morning to deliver its load of workers, the pastor&rsquo;s prayers calm stressed souls.And as the journey nears its end, some commuters pay the man with the Bible who holds out his hat.Pastor Tshapane Moeketsi (81), from Kliptown, Soweto warns train riders, especially men, that if they don&rsquo;t give offerings, their wives and girlfriends will be found bonking in other men&rsquo;s beds!He even quotes at length from the Good Book, especially from Malachi: &ldquo;Is it right for a person to cheat God? Of course not, yet you are cheating me in the matter of tithes and offerings.&ldquo;Bring the full amount. Put me to the test and I will open the windows of heaven and pour out on you in abundance all kinds of good things.&rdquo; The pastor&rsquo;s warning doesn&rsquo;t seem to bother commuters.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I catch the early train every day to give people food for their souls. &ldquo;I know many people don&rsquo;t have time to go to church because they are busy. Some work every day. It&rsquo;s important for me to reach them.&rdquo; The idea of preaching on the train came to him when he was pushed out of a moving train by evil men. This made him realise that people needed God wherever they are. Since then he&rsquo;s been praying for people on the move.The pastor explained his demand for payment: &ldquo;I am not forcing people to pay me for preaching to them. I work for God and He rewards me.&ldquo;It might be funny and I might look stupid &ndash; but that&rsquo;s what happened to Noah in the Bible.&ldquo;I am not a fool!&rdquo;
