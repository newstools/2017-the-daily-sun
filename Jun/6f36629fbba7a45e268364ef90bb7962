MURDER accused mom Abigail Ruiters shouted at her boyfriend, Ameeruddien Peters, after it emerged in the Cape Town Magistrate&rsquo;s Court earlier today that the little boy had been raped: &ldquo;What did you do to my child?&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything to him,&rdquo; Peters responded as Ruiters burst into tears as both were standing in the dock. The six-months pregnant mom of three appeared alongside Peters, 26, just over a week after the death of 18-month-old Jeremiah Ruiters. Ruiters refused to stand next to Peters as neighbours in the public gallery cried. She also pushed him away when he tried to plead with her to listen to him. During bail information proceedings it emerged that Ruiters was at work at the time of her son&rsquo;s death. She was the sole provider for her household. Neither of the accused has a criminal record and the matter was postponed to July 5. The little boy is expected to be buried on Saturday. Ruiters&rsquo; father, Pastor Ronald Ruiters, confirmed last week that he would first speak to his daughter to decide if the family would wait for her possible release on bail so that she could attend her youngest son&rsquo;s funeral. Ruiters has been charged under the Children&rsquo;s Act and now also with murder, and Peters has been charged with murder and rape. The toddler died on Monday last week of serious injuries to his head and body. The couple lived together with Ruiters&rsquo; three children and had been together for about a year. Pastor Ruiters has officiated at a number of funerals for young victims of violent crimes, including Celine Cowley, 4, who was sexually assaulted and stabbed in Ravensmead in August 2006, and Nadine Jantjies, 7, who was raped and strangled in Wesbank in 2009. He described his grandson as a loving child who always smiled when he held him. Three months ago the toddler was hospitalised for a broken arm. According to social workers&rsquo; records he had also been hospitalised on two previous occasions.
