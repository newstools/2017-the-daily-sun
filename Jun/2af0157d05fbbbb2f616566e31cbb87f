EMBATTLED f ormer Eskom CEO Brian Molefe, is challenging the board's decision to fire him. Molefe served labour court papers on both Eskom and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.&nbsp; Brown's spokesperson Colin Cruywagen confirmed to Fin24 on Sunday that the Minister's office received the papers and her legal team is studying the documents.&nbsp; Spokesperson of the Eskom board, Khulani Qoma also confirmed receipt of Molefe's challenge.&nbsp;At the time of publication, Molefe did not respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;On Friday, Eskom announced that Molefe is no longer the group chief executive of Eskom and that he will also no longer serve as a director on the board of Eskom.Molefe agreed to return to Eskom after Brown discovered he had been granted a R30m early pension payout by Eskom, which she refused to condone.She asked the board to find another solution and his reinstatement followed.Brown at the time said Molefe's reappointment was a better value proposition for the South African fiscus. However, following a backlash from the ANC, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters, an inter-ministerial committee concluded that Brown should order the Eskom board to withdraw Molefe's reappointment.When Brown ordered the Eskom board to withdraw Molefe's reappointment, she also asked it to provide her with two names from the Eskom executive to become acting chief executive.http://www.fin24.com/Economy/breaking-brian-molefe-challenges-his-removal-as-ceo-20170604 #BrianMolefe re-instatement was wrong in principle and practice,I don't get it why that need a court of law to preside over it,maybe am dumb&mdash; Malema's??Supplier (@KanyoSinyanya) June 5, 2017I believe #BrianMolefe dilemma doesn't require the law to preside over it,it's a matter that requires morality not the law.&mdash; Malema's??Supplier (@KanyoSinyanya) June 5, 2017Not a week passes without #BrianMolefe trending&mdash; Lesedi Seatlholo (@lesedithegr8) June 5, 2017Cat has 9 lives, Hlaudi has 20 lives and Brian has 30 lives #BrianMolefe&mdash; NKOKHI (@nkokhi) June 5, 2017so despite all this gupta leaks, our current public protector is no a show?is she also captured?we need @ThuliMadonsela3 fast #brianmolefe&mdash; Mannana Nape (@spadonapster) June 5, 2017#BrianMolefe is holding Eskom to ransom, says Sanco https://t.co/z6Odx4sdQ7 #RSA #SouthAfrica&mdash; RSAzaNet (@RSAzaNet) June 5, 2017
