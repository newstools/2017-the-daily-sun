POLICE in Limpopo say cash-in-transit robbers were wounded during a shootout with security guards at Georges Valley near Tzaneen this morning. Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the suspects fled the scene after the shootout. He said the provincial tracking team had been deployed to track the suspects. Ngoepe said the suspects were attempting to rob a cash-in-transit vehicle. The vehicle was travelling along the R528 Georges Valley Road between Haenertzburg and Tzaneen Road when three other vehicles tried to block it. Those in the three vehicles managed to get the cash-in-transit vehicle pulled off the road and suspects started shooting at it with rifles. They fled the scene without any cash. &ldquo;During this incident there was a crossfire between the security officers and the suspects where seemingly some of these suspects were shot and injured but their accomplices took the injured suspects away,&rdquo; said Ngoepe. The suspects were alleged to be using two Mercedes Benz sedans, one black and the second white, and the third vehicle was a Toyota Quantum minivan. The three vehicles had GP registration numbers. Anyone with information about the incident should contact police Captain Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or their nearest police station.
