Thousands of EFF supporters, clad in their characteristic red T-shirts and berets, filled up the Boipatong Stadium, in the Vaal, ahead of the Youth Day celebrations today.&nbsp;A sea of red made their way into the stadium while they were entertained with songs and slogans, including chants of "Long live EFF".&nbsp;EFF leader Julius Malema was expected to address the masses on Friday afternoon.&nbsp;About 50 buses were parked outside the stadium. Some youth dressed in their school uniform were also in attendance.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/p2-boipatong-a-sea-of-red-as-thousands-of-eff-supporters-descend-20170616#EFF supporters fill up Boipatong stadium ahead of their #YouthDay celebrations. @News24 pic.twitter.com/HqFaB4ikEv&mdash; Iavan Pijoos (@Iavan13) June 16, 2017#EFF crowd at the #YouthDay2017 celebrations at the Boipatong stadium. @News24 pic.twitter.com/B3D54wVfdZ&mdash; Iavan Pijoos (@Iavan13) June 16, 2017
