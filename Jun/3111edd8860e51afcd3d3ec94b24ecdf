LIVING with a child with diabetes comes with many challenges.You need to deal with the physical, emotional, social, spiritual and mental wellbeing of your child.Rosemary Flynn, a clinical psychologist at the Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology, says understanding the needs of diabetic children at various stages of development is very important. This also helps parents better identify and understand a child&rsquo;s specific needs and emotions at each age.This is true for children up to 12 years of age, but once they are teens, managing the disease needs to be tackled differently.&ldquo;How well the body copes with diabetes is strongly linked to how the child thinks, feels and relates to other people.&rdquo;She also gave parents some insights to help manage their children.Initiative and self-control Both initiative to be able to make the right decision when needed, and also discipline, to manage the disease, are needed.Developing a conscience For children to take responsibility for their own health and to make the right choices depend to a large extent on values such as honesty, success, achievement, self-reliance and being co-operative. Having a well-integrated conscience is the key to developing these values.Family balance Children react better when they have clear limits, expectations and rules which adapt as they move into their teenage years. Feelings are valued and the connection between parents and children is of utmost importance at this stage.Sibling Relationships Parents should find a balance in the way they handle their children and how they give each of their children quality time.Managing anxiety Coping with diabetes is always going to be a family affair.Parents play a vital role in how much anxiety is experienced by the diabetic child, whether it is about specific fears related to diabetes or fears that arise in their life as a result of having diabetes. All fears have an impact on how well the child will cope with having diabetes.Anger Angry children may sabotage their diabetes management. It is important to acknowledge this anger and work with the child to enable them to reduce their anger.Depression Three ways to help children become more resistant to depression includes building their self-esteem, encouraging physical activity and finding a support group.
