THE HAPPY mother had just been blessed with no fewer than four&nbsp;babies.&nbsp; On Friday, she held her healthy kids in her arms and her joy knew no bounds.&nbsp; ON SATURDAY, SHE WAS TOLD ALL FOUR OF THEM WERE DEAD.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have words to explain the pain I&rsquo;m going through. I feel like dying,&rdquo; said Khumbuzile Xaba. The 37-year-old from Emdeni, Soweto is holding the staff at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital responsible for the tragedy. &ldquo;Bara killed my four babies. They must tell me what they did to them,&rdquo; she cried. When she first fell pregnant, she didn&rsquo;t know she was expecting four babies. She was given the information at Thembelihle Clinic in Lenasia and later a scan at Bara confirmed she was expecting three boys and a girl. Khumbuzile was seven months pregnant when she started experiencing labour pains last Friday and was taken to hospital. &ldquo;I was told I could give birth at any time,&rdquo; she said. She was taken to theatre and it didn&rsquo;t take long before the first baby arrived at about 12.15pm in the afternoon. She said the nurses were ululating and proudly saying they had never helped a woman give birth to four babies before. &ldquo;I was happy to hear my kids cry and I saw them being taken by nurses to be cleaned,&rdquo; she said. A few hours later she was taken to see the babies in their ward and held them. The babies were in incubators.&nbsp; Khumbuzile said when she left the ward they were healthy. &ldquo;I had even named them. The boys were Golden Sphamandla, Gift Siyabonga, Prince Sibusiso and the girl was Princess Sphesihle.&rdquo;&nbsp; But that was the last time she saw them alive. On Saturday she was told the children were dead. &ldquo;I was shocked. I couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were saying. I demanded answers but they didn&rsquo;t tell me anything,&rdquo; Khumbuzile said. She said she was discharged on Monday without being given any information. The babies are in the hospital mortuary and the family is arranging a proper burial. Khumbuzile said she also wants the hospital to perform a post mortem to find out why the babies died. &ldquo;The scans I have of the babies are the only pictures I&rsquo;ll ever have of my four babies as a reminder of their short lives. I&rsquo;m left with only the clothes that I bought for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The father of the children, Enos Bila (46), said they want answers from the hospital. &ldquo;This was negligence. How can my children die when they were so healthy?&rdquo; Prince Hamnca of the Gauteng Department of Health said they are aware of the case and are investigating the details.
