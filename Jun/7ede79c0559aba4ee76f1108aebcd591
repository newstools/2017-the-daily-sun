ORLANDO PIRATES striker Tendai Ndoro has allegedly left his family in a pickle.&nbsp;This as insiders claim the 29-year-old soccer star is allegedly behind on payments for his rented flat in Midrand, Gauteng.According to the first source, Tendai&rsquo;s twin brother, Takudzwa, has even been hassling other soccer players in a bid to raise enough money to pay rent.&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a soccer player and stay around Kempton Park, Takudzwa&rsquo;s probably paid you a visit. He&rsquo;s been trying to raise R9&thinsp;500,&rdquo; the mole said.&ldquo;He told us he badly needed the cash, as Tendai had failed to pay in advance for the months he&rsquo;d not be around due to him being on duty for the Zimbabwean national team.&rdquo;The source claimed Takudzwa also asked that he be bought food.Said the source: &ldquo;I wonder why Tendai neglected his family in this manner?&rdquo;A second source claimed they saw Takudzwa being bought food and handed&nbsp;R1&thinsp;500.&ldquo;It was evident, even through his actions, that he needed that money.&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not sure if the eviction story is true. All I know is he desperately needed cash,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;Tendai should have paid rent and bought food for Takudzwa, who has apparently been left stranded with his and Tandai&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;&ldquo;He said the only thing he knew was he had to raise the rent money, as his brother was outside the country and there was no alternative.&rdquo;When called for comment, Takudzwa dismissed the claims.&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;ve never met the person you&rsquo;re talking about. I stay in Witbank and never took any money from anyone,&rdquo; he said before hanging up the phone.&ldquo;We asked him why they were being kicked out if they had only defaulted for one month, and he said he wasn&rsquo;t sure.&nbsp;Tendai could not be reached, as he was in camp for his national team game.
