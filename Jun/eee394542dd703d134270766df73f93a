A WELL-KNOWN pastor and businessman has been arrested for fraud. The man, who cannot be named as he hasn&rsquo;t pleaded yet, and a popular actor are accused of running a Forex scam. Bramley police spokesman Captain Molefe Mogodi said the suspect was being held at the Sandton Police Station and would appear in court on Monday. The pastor and the actor apparently found victims by offering classes to beginners to teach them to trade Forex. Forex stands for foreign exchange market. Traders exchange currencies used to conduct foreign trade and business. The scam the two were allegedly involved in has become popular around the world. Victim Zelda Romudzulu said she was defrauded of over R400 000. She said she met the pair in March. &ldquo;They told me they were running an investment group, and if I invested R20 000 it would grow at an interest rate of 30% per month. They kept telling me to put in more money and just kept eating my cash,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I eventually became suspicious and went to the South African Institute of Stockbrokers, which confirmed their business was not a financial services provider and, therefore, couldn&rsquo;t give or take money from people.&rdquo; Zelda is just one of many people who has fallen victim to the scam. However, there are legitimate Forex traders and some people have made a lot of money through trading. One of South Africa&rsquo;s top traders is Ref Wayne, the youngest billionaire in Mzansi.
