THE African National Congress Women&rsquo;s League (ANCWL) has defended its decision to have six men in its delegation at the party&rsquo;s policy conference. It was reported that ANCWL president Bathabile Dlamini justified the inclusion of men in the delegation by saying that women were &ldquo;too emotional&rdquo;. ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said the league was neither surprised nor shocked by the report, in the Sunday Times. She called the report politically motivated, saying it was driven by &ldquo;the mouthpiece of the neo-liberals&rdquo;. She said the ANCWL had staff and partners across all genders who were gender activists in their own right. &ldquo;Their inputs in shaping policies and programs that contribute to building a united, non-sexist society are warmly welcomed and appreciated.&rdquo; She said Dlamini and her collective would not be deterred by media reports about the league&rsquo;s demands, among them the expropriation of land without compensation, the establishment of a state bank, legislation of 50/50 gender parity in all sectors at all levels, free sanitary pads for all girls of the poor and working class, and free and compulsory education for the children of the poor and working class until undergraduate level.
