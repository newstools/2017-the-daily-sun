THE residents of Chris Hani squatter camp in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, want a better life. They are gatvol of empty promises and leaders who use their living conditions for political gain. Nomzamo Sindilo (51) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;Chris Hani kasi is one of the oldest squatter camps. It was developed in 1988.&ldquo;At that time I was staying in KwaZakhele. I took over this shack in 2008. &ldquo;Many empty promises were made to us, like in the 1990s we were told that the whole squatter camp would go to Kamvelihle and Wells Estate.&ldquo;However, nothing happened and new kasis like Silver Shacks near New Brighton were built. &ldquo;But we are still here.&rdquo; Nomzamo said every official had lied to them.&ldquo;From 2011, councillors and community leaders have been changing their statements. Some leaders have said that some of us will go to Khayamnandi near Despatch, while others claimed that all of us would be moved there. &ldquo;Now we are confused and frustrated. We don&rsquo;t know what the future holds for us.&ldquo;We are still using the bucket toilet system and we don&rsquo;t have electricity. We are forced to pay for izinyoka at R200 a month from KwaZakheke and New Brighton kasis.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford izinyoka and have to use a paraffin stove.&rdquo;Ncedo Vena (47) said: &ldquo;It is frustrating to live here. Most of us are unemployed and earn a living by selling bottles for recycling. Our leaders are changing statements and we don&rsquo;t trust anyone.&rdquo;Councillor Nqaba Bhanga, member of the mayoral committee for human settlements in Nelson Mandela Bay, said: &ldquo;The whole community in Chris Hani is moving to Motherwell NU29 and Joe Slovo kasis and the process has started already. &ldquo;However, there are a few who are resisting the move and we will deal with them.&ldquo;At the moment I don&rsquo;t know exactly the total number of shacks here. But what I can say is that the whole area is moving, because this kasi is not fit for people to live in. It was a dumpsite,&rdquo; he said.
