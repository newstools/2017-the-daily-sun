MOTORISTS travelling on the R82 today and tomorrow will have to find another route. Residents of the newly developed Savanna City in Midvaal, Gauteng, have vowed to close the road between Joburg and Vereeniging until tomorrow if mayor Bongani Baloyi doesn&rsquo;t address their grievances. Yesterday, they barricaded the busy road with rocks, traffic signs and burning tyres.Community representative Khulile Qaba said: &ldquo;One of the complaints we have is the high tariffs we have to pay. &ldquo;This is a low-cost housing area but they charge us the same as people living on neighbouring plots.&rdquo; Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said a case of public violence was opened against residents. The Midvaal Municipality said the matter had been escalated to the public protector, who advised that a formal meeting be held. It was scheduled for 10am today. Meanwhile, residents of Sicelo and Silahliwe squatter camps in Midvaal protested from the early hours of yesterday for better services. Captain Mavela Masondo said: &ldquo;Protesters threw stones at motorists and we had to use stun grenades to disperse the crowd.&rdquo;
