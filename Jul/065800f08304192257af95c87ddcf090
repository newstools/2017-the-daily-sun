 two are facing charges of possession of stolen chrome. They 
joined seven other suspects linked to the illegal mining case.The pair will remain in custody until August 1 for their formal bail application.They were arrested after police launched a special operation in the Sekhukhune district.Illegal
 miners had targeted the district over the past few months. As a result,
 tons of chrome were mined from mostly abandoned mines and unchartered 
areas in the region.It is understood that the sites targeted were specifically areas where mining had been halted for rehabilitation processes.For more than eight years, locals dug and exploited the leftovers in the platinum and chrome rich belt.Meanwhile, Mineral Resources Deputy Minister Godfrey Oliphant is currently meeting mining stakeholders in the area.Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they will continue monitoring the area."Our investigations are ongoing. There is possibility of making more arrests," he said.
