Kaloku, Zinhle moved out of her Sandton rental in Bryanston because her fraudster boyfriend was supposedly building her a house. Kanti, dololo house,&rdquo; the source said.&ldquo;So, she went to stay at an Airbnb in Fourways, north of Jozi, for about two months before moving in with Pearl. &ldquo;Zinhle&rsquo;s friend is rumoured back in Mzansi because the US series Quantico, in which she acted, has allegedly ended.&rdquo;A third source insisted: &ldquo;Zinhle is now working on getting her own place.&rdquo;Both DJ Zinhle and Brendan could not be reached for comment and they also failed to respond to SMSes at the time of going to press.
