 of Vuwani were marching in Thohoyandou to hand over a memorandum at the 
Vhembe District Municipality's office, in their demand to not be part of
 the newly formed municipality, LIM345.The protesters marched from Univen Park to the Vhembe district offices, where they handed a memorandum of grievances to the acting mayor, Thina Mbedzi. Government was given seven days to respond.There was a heavy police presence, with a police helicopter hovering over the area.Last year 30 schools were either torched or vandalised during violent protests against demarcation.Two
 months ago the Presidency said the community of Vuwani should be 
serviced by Vhembe District Municipality while a solution to the 
demarcation issue was sought.It was further agreed that 
relevant national and provincial departments would support the Vhembe 
District Municipality in undertaking this new responsibility.Despite numerous attempts, Vhembe District Mayor Florence Radzilani could not be reached for comment.
