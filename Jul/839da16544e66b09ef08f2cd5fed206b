A TRADER escaped death when men bombed the shop he was sleeping in at Orinoco. This was near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga early on Thursday. Amir Shahzad (31) told Daily Sun he was asleep in the shop when footsteps outside woke him up.&ldquo;I heard the sound of pistols being cocked.&ldquo;Then the shop wall was struck with a heavy object.&ldquo;Someone threw a petrol bomb inside and suddenly there were huge flames around me.&ldquo;I screamed for help and tried to run away, but a gang of men outside pointed their guns at me and threatened to blow my brains out.&ldquo;The shop with all the stock inside was burning. &ldquo;Luckily, some good Samaritans came to my rescue, otherwise the fire or the thugs would have killed me,&rdquo; said Amir.Shocked landlord Ben Ngobeni (57) said he had to back off from rescuing Amir in the burning shop as the gunmen threatened to kill him.&ldquo;I had jumped out of bed to rescue Amir but the gunmen ordered me to stay away,&rdquo; Ben said.&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s the same thugs who tried to break into the shop two years ago. That time they couldn&rsquo;t take anything as they were chased away by angry residents.&ldquo;Recently they stole Amir&rsquo;s bakkie. There is a lot of crime in our village.&rdquo;Councillor Mandla Mapiyeye said: &ldquo;I condemn this terrible attack on the shop. We are working with the police to catch the men.&rdquo;Captain Gugulethu Phiri said a case of arson had been opened. Anyone with information should call Mhala police on 013 773 0331.
