THERE is no more space for the dead in Avalon Cemetery. Jenny Moodley, spokeswoman for City Parks, told Daily Sun that Avalon is one of the fullest cemeteries in the city.&ldquo;The City of Joburg has 32 cemeteries and 28 have reached their capacity. One of them is Avalon.&ldquo;Joburg City Parks has been advising families, particularly residents living in the south of Joburg, that the 187 hectare cemetery has reached capacity for primary burials.&rdquo;She said City Parks has come up with an alternative method of burial.&ldquo;Families who already have loved ones buried in Avalon can consider re-opening graves for second and third family burials.&rdquo; Moodley said this may be a practical solution for communities surrounding the cemetery. She said only five cemeteries are still active. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an eye-opener to everyone as this affects the whole city. The five cemeteries left are West Park, Diepsloot, Waterfall, Lenasia and Olifantsvlei, which have enough burial space for the next 50 years, based on the year-to-year burial trends in the city,&rdquo; said Moodley.The 45-year-old Avalon Cemetery, which opened in 1972 for black people during the apartheid era, is the resting place of important South Africans like Hector Pieterson, Joe Slovo and Lilian Ngoyi.
