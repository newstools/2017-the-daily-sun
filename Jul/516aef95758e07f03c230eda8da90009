Actress Amanda Du-Pont and Fashion Stylist Kefilwe Mabote were spotted wearing the same dress.&nbsp; Both ladies look stunning rocking the tassel trend.&nbsp; A tassel is a finishing feature in fabric and clothing decoration, which is almost similar to fringe.&nbsp; Amanda's dress is black, and she pairs her dress with pointy black strap heels and cornrows.&nbsp; Kefilwe's dress is nudish pink, and she pairs her dress with nude pointy heels and big sun glasses.&nbsp; Who do you think wore it best?
