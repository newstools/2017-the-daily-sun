You have to maintain it through all seasons. Summer is the longest season and people should enjoy it.”He says he doesn’t take a break because it takes time for him to regain.“I’m scared to take a break from the gym because it takes time for me to develop muscles. I have to regularly attend the gym because I don’t eat well often,” he said. Mncebisi doesn’t have a personal trainer, but is disciplined.“I know what I want to achieve with my body. I have a lot of fat and consume lots of fat, so I need to be consistent with exercising.”It’s hard to stay on a healthy diet during winter. Most people eat a lot in winter. Thato Mahlangu said she’s lazy to go to gym on cold days.“I go to gym because it allows me time to work out. I can’t work out on my own. I need to be with people so I can be motivated.”Thato says she only eats healthy food, then goes to gym to tone her body.“In summer, I want beautiful thighs and a firm ass. It takes time for the body to firm up.”She said she went to gym a month before spring so she didn’t have to hide her body.Fitness enthusiast, Cleopatra Simelane, said people got fat due to a lack self-motivation.“People haven’t mastered the art of knowing their bodies in order to channel their energy. They let the weather dictate to them whether or not to go to gym.”She added: “I started working out in the dining room. When I joined the gym, I didn’t need to do a lot of workouts.“It’s important to have – not a summer body – but a body you’re comfortable in.“When you have a great body, you can dress the way you like. Working out keeps you energised and you don’t get sick often,” she said.Cleopatra said it’s important to set yourself goals and see yourself in a certain body shape.“My advice to people is to start small, to allow the body adjust to changes. You can eat any junk food you want, but don’t overindulge.“I do eat junk, but in small amounts. If you buy something that will affect your weight, share it with someone so you don’t suffer at the end of the day.”Here are Cleopatra’s tips to help readers get their dream body Read inspirational books for motivation.Change your habits.
