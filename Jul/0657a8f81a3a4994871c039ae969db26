At about 7pm I helped her to her room.&rdquo;A few minutes later people started screaming that they could see flames in the room.&ldquo;We tried to fight the fire with buckets of water but the blaze was too strong,&rdquo; said Lonwabo.He said Ntombomzi was a non-smoker and there were no electrical appliances in her room.
