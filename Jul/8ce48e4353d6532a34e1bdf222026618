FOUR suspects who are believed to have been terrorising residents were arrested on Saturday and their handguns confiscated.&nbsp; But guns were not the only weapons they apparently used to carry out house robberies and hijackings.&nbsp; A lumpy, fatty substance which cops identified as muthi was also found in their car!&nbsp; Captain Nelda Sekgobela, a Tembisa South police spokeswoman, said a number of house robbery and hijacking cases had been reported to the&nbsp; Sebenza cop shop in Edenvale, Ekurhuleni, recently.&nbsp; They bust the suspects while patrolling in the Chloorkop area and after tailing a white Chevrolet sedan with four occupants in it.&nbsp; &ldquo;They followed it until it stopped next to shops at China Gate that were about to close,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; Two of the suspects got out of the car and ran away. Cops managed to bust the two other suspects, aged 22 and 24.&nbsp; &ldquo;The suspects were searched and muthi, two unlicensed firearms and 19 rounds of ammunition were found in their possession.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were taken to Sebenza cop shop, where they were detained. They&rsquo;re believed to be behind a string of crimes in Tembisa.&nbsp; &ldquo;Police will profile the suspects and there&rsquo;s a possibility that they&rsquo;ll be linked to a number of other crimes reported at the station,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; They will face charges of possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition.&nbsp; Sangoma Precious Sithole, also known as Dabulamanzi, said the thugs might have been using a hyena tail and muthi to make sure they were not caught.&nbsp; &ldquo;When they attack their victims they are like beasts and it&rsquo;s not easy to catch them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But the more people they terrorise the more bad luck follows them.&rdquo;
