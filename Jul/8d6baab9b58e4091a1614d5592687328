COMPUTERS have been stolen in a break-in at the Hawks&rsquo; head office in Silverton, Pretoria.Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi says they found out early this morning, but the theft could have taken place on Tuesday night.The intruders focused mostly on the HR, finance and supply chain departments, which contained confidential information."We are still trying to ascertain if any documents are missing. That will only be confirmed once the forensic, fingerprints team are done with their work," he said.No dockets were stolen, Mulaudzi said there were no visible signs of a break-in."The only way through to access the environment is to use access cards. We will be looking at the security footage to see if it is up to scratch or not, and if not, surely we must take action."A dedicated team would be investigating further.In March, 15 computers were stolen from the Office of the Chief Justice in Midrand.At the time, then acting national police commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane said the computers were taken from the HR department and contained sensitive information about the country&rsquo;s judges.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/computers-stolen-in-brazen-burglary-at-hawks-head-office-20170705
