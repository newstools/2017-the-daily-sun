IT WILL be the battle of the newbies at this year&rsquo;s opening match of the Bokone Bophirima Maize Cup on 15 July when Peter Butler&rsquo;s Platinum Stars take on Sammy Troughton&rsquo;s Free State Stars.Ea Lla Koto just appointed Troughton to lead their technical bench, while PSL entrant Butler just resigned from Botswana to fill up the void left by Cavin Johnson at Dikwena.This day-long off-season tournament moves to Orkney&rsquo;s James Motlatsi Stadium this year, where organisers are expecting a full house on the day.The province will be giving away free beanies to the first 2 000 fans streaming in through the gates into the stadium to watch Ea Lla Koto and Dikwena clash at 10am before Kaizer Chiefs and Botswana champions Township Rollers battle it out in the second match. The final is scheduled for 4pm.Tickets are believed to be selling well. Musicians Solly Moholo, Doctor Malinga, Bucie and Bhizer, who will provide entertainment on the day, are also crowd-pullers.Troughton told SunSport this week that he was looking forward to working with Stars again &ndash; this time as head coach with Sly Mosala by his side.The Maize Cup gives coaches a chance to see their new signings in action and take note of areas where their teams are lacking before the MTN8 and new Premiership season start next month.Also ahead for Chiefs and coach Steve Komphela is the Carling Black Label Champion Cup, which should also draw a massive crowd at FNB Stadium on 29 July.The Maize Cup is great platform for Komphela to assess Philani Zulu, who joined Amakhosi from Maritzburg United, and ex-Chicken Inn player Teenage Hadebe in a competitive match.
