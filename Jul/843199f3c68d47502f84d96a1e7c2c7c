OCEAN View teenager Camron Britz was raped anally and vaginally with an object pushed down her throat and then she was strangled to death, the Simon's Town Magistrate's Court heard today.This was revealed during the first appearance of the man arrested in connection with the 14-year-old girl's rape and murder.Prosecutor Chloe Morris told the court that Britz was at a community bonfire when the accused called her away and told her to go with him because her father was looking for her.The accused, who is a cousin in Britz's family, stood in the dock in a grey windbreaker.Morris told Magistrate Crystal McKenna that the accused had a previous charge of sexual assault in 2015 which was withdrawn.Morris said that eyewitnesses allegedly saw the two together several times after he called her away from the bonfire. They had also allegedly seen him coming out of the bushes on Slangkop road where her body was found.A DNA report will determine what was pushed down her throat, but it resembled a reed.It is a Schedule 6 case and the accused has to show exceptional circumstances before being granted bail because the allegations involve a minor.He opted to have Legal Aid represent him and the case was rolled over to Thursday for his bail application to start.Meanwhile, Britz's mum Berenice Britz sobbed quietly after she was locked out of the courthouse earlier.She had left the building for the short tea break and could not get back in again because the police had locked the front gate to keep a group of about 20 angry neighbours out of the building.Eventually she was allowed in.Clutching the green security bars as neighbours and family shouted angrily at the court officials to let them in, she seemed astounded that she was not allowed to go back in.&nbsp;http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/horrific-details-emerge-of-ocean-view-teens-rape-and-murder-20170705
