POLICE have confirmed that an investigation has been launched into graphic sexual messages apparently sent from the head of detectives in the Western Cape to an official group comprised of several detective commanders in the province.It is understood that Major-General Patrick Mbotho, the deputy provincial commissioner of detectives, sent the two messages from his official cellphone via WhatsApp last Thursday, July 13.The first message said he wanted &ldquo;this&rdquo; done to his private parts.A graphic close-up video of a man and woman having sex was then also sent to the group of detective heads, of which a few other senior police heads are also members. Mbotho then sent out apologies.&ldquo;Sorry guys delete that,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad joke to my friend,&rdquo; another said.Earlier today Mbotho sounded mortified: &ldquo;I am not being rude, I wish I could talk to you,&rdquo; he said. He said when he realised he had sent the messages, he wished he could have been swallowed into a hole. Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said: &ldquo;Western Cape police management are aware of the allegations, which are currently under investigation.&rdquo;ANC activist Colin Arendse wrote to several police managers including Police Minister Fikile Mbalula earlier today after the graphic messages were forwarded to him. &ldquo;I am told that several detective commanders who are part of this WhatsApp group were devastated and shocked at the extremely graphic nature of the pornographic clip and the sick message,&rdquo; Arendse&rsquo;s email to them said.&ldquo;General Mbotho, it pains me that while the people of the Western Cape are dodging live bullets and wondering when you will oversee the finalisation of several outstanding dockets, you have the time to engage in illegal and morally corrupt activities,&rdquo; it said.
