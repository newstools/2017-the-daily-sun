BAFANA Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter jetted off to Europe last night on a recruitment mission. The celebrated Bafana coach will visit three and possibly even a fourth European country in the next two weeks. He arrives in Italy today, then jets to Sweden and then to London, England. He said he was hoping to also get a chance to watch Bafana midfield star Bongani Zungu in action for his Portuguese club Vitoria de Guimaraes early next month.But the ex-SuperSport United coach was mum on his mission to Italy yesterday, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s top secret.&ldquo;I will be attending a game in Italy and will be meeting with a couple of people,&rdquo; was all he would disclose.However, he is set to meet with Juventus&rsquo; 23-year-old defender Joel Untersee, who was born in Roodepoort but has a Swiss passport and is eligible for Bafana, having only played for Switzerland at youth level. Baxter admitted he was looking for possible Bafana players to boost his pool, but refused to elaborate. He will be in Italy for two days before going to Sweden.Baxter coached extensively in Sweden and is well known in that country.&ldquo;There are a couple of players in Sweden I want to look at and talk to their coaches,&rdquo; he divulged.He will stay in Sweden for four days.The coach will then be on his way to London for a couple of days to visit English Championship side Brentford, based west of the English capital.Brentford recently signed Bafana midfield star Kamohelo &ldquo;Kamo&rdquo; Mokotjo (26) on a three-year deal from Dutch Eredivisie side FC Twente.Said Baxter: &ldquo;I will be meeting with Kamo and the Brentford coach ahead of our crucial back-to-back World Cup qualifiers against Cape Verde in September. &ldquo;And if I get a chance, I will try and see Zungu in Portugal before I return home ahead of our Chan (African Nations Championship) qualifier against Zambia.&rdquo;Bafana meet Zambia in their final two-legged Chan qualifier on 11 and 18 August.But Baxter will be focused on the 2019 World Cup qualifiers against Cape Verde. He explained: &ldquo;The World Cup qualifiers are vital. The Chan games are close to the World Cup ones unfortunately, so while I will stay involved with the Chan squad, I will be working more on the World Cup qualifiers.&rdquo;That would see Baxter&rsquo;s assistant, Thabo Senong, take a bigger role with the Chan squad.Baxter stressed that he would continue to use budding young players in Chan in a bid to give more youngsters a chance to play international football.He will adopt similar squads to the ones that featured in the Cosafa Cup and Chan: &ldquo;I believe we were successful in both Chan and the Cosafa Cup by unearthing some young talent and I would like to see more younger players get a chance against Zambia.&rdquo;Only players featuring in their domestic leagues are eligible for Chan which makes selection a headache for Baxter:&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right in the middle of the MTN8 and the start of the Absa Premiership during the Chan games.&rdquo;
