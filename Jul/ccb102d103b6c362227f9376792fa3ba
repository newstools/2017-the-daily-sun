I quickly took my clothes and went back home.” Basani Rhangani (35) said they live in constant fear of the massive hippo.“It comes into my yard at night. We pray it doesn’t smash our house. We appeal to game rangers to come and kill this hippo before it kills us.” Eric Tivani from the local tribal authority told Daily Sun a fisherman was attacked by a hippo last year and later died in hospital. “We appeal to the villagers not to go to the dam because it’s dangerous.”
