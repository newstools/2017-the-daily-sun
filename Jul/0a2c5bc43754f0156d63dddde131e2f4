MURDERED DA Councillor Xolile Gwangxu was buried on Saturday. Hundreds of mourners gathered at Lwandlana Village, near Mthatha were left with more questions than answers about the killing. The 42-year-old councillor was shot dead in front of other DA members in Philippi East, Cape Town, two weeks ago. After the murder, DA leader Mmusi Maimane urged members to remain calm. He assured Gwangxu&rsquo;s family the party was working with the cops to find his killers. Maimane and other senior party leaders attended the funeral.He told mourners: &ldquo;Our work is not done. We will fight for justice for Xolile. We can fight with words, but we cannot fight with bullets. The way Xolile lost his life can never be tolerated. &ldquo;Xolile was a great leader who still had a lot to offer. Our country needs more people like him.&rdquo; Gwangxu&rsquo;s brother and family spokesman Thozama said the family was at a loss without him. &ldquo;Our brother was the pillar of this family. We are left with unanswered questions about why he was killed.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also very sad that we had to find out about his death on Facebook.&rdquo; The DA has offered a reward of R50 000 to anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the killer. Maimane promised to do something for the village in honour of Gwangxu.
