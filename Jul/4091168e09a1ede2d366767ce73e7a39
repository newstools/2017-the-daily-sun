MDUDUZI Mashapa (46) is angry with the cops.A crime prevention officer allegedly took his driver&rsquo;s licence two months ago.Mduduzi told Daily Sun he was told to collect it at the cop shop, but now the cop has vanished with his licence.He said he was on his way home to Winterveld, Tshwane, when he was stopped by two cops in Brits, North West, on 17 May.&ldquo;While I was talking to one cop, the other one came on the passenger&rsquo;s side and asked me questions,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I told them not to ask me questions all at once.&rdquo;But it seems that was his biggest mistake.&ldquo;The cop who was on the other side asked to see my driver&rsquo;s licence, and I gave it to him. But he never gave it back,&rdquo; said Mduduzi.&ldquo;He told me to collect the licence at the police station in Brits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But when I went there on a Monday, I was told that the officers were both on leave. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising that until today they are nowhere to be found, and I&rsquo;m driving without a licence.&rdquo; He said he even spoke to the station commander.&ldquo;He told me that the cops would report for duty last Monday, but when I went to the cop shop they still hadn&rsquo;t returned.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sent from pillar to post, and now I&rsquo;m frustrated. I don&rsquo;t know what crime I&rsquo;ve committed to be treated like this. &ldquo;All I want is my driver&rsquo;s licence, nothing else.&rdquo;Brits police spokesman Warrant Officer Mpeile Talane asked for the Mduduzi&rsquo;s contact details.&ldquo;I will call him so that he can come to the police station to identify the two officers who took his licence,&rdquo; Talane told the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;We will investigate to find out why his licence was kept for such a long time.&rdquo;
