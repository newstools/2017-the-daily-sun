ANGRY hip hop fans demanded their money back after one of the biggest stars failed to perform at the Official Vodacom Durban July Launch Concert at the Greyville Racecourse in Durban,Kwazulu-Natal, on Friday.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kwesta&rdquo;, real name Senzo Vilakazi, arrived at the venue with his band, only to discover that there were too many problems.&nbsp; The Ngiyaz&rsquo;fela Ngawe hitmaker was booked to perform at the event organised by Mabala Noise Entertainment.&nbsp; What was meant to be a night to remember, turned sour when Kwesta refused to take to the stage.&nbsp; This because of poor sound and light quality.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has learnt that Kwesta was only allocated 15 minutes with poor sound system and a not-so-well-lit stage to perform on.&nbsp; Kwesta could not be reached for comment.&nbsp; But he took to Twitter to apologise to his many fuming fans on the night of the event.&nbsp; I would like to apologise to Greyville Racecourse to see me at the @Mabala_Noise event.&nbsp; Business wasn&rsquo;t handled right, Kwesta tweeted.&nbsp; The rapper also threw shade at the 15-minute slot he was given.&nbsp; A 15-minute show would be disrespectful to you. We came as a band and rehearsed a whole show for the event.&nbsp; Till the next one. Apologies, read another tweet.&nbsp; Mabala Noise spokesperson, Mhlo Gumede, asked the SunTeam to send him an email, but he had not responded at the time of going to press.&nbsp;
