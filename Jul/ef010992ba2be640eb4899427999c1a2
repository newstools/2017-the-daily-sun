THE Western Cape has more than 250 000 drug addicts and most of them are young. This is according to social worker Lucille Keith, who was speaking to kids and youths at Lwandle Library last Wednesday.&ldquo;Substance abuse is one of the biggest challenges in the Western Cape. People buy medication over the counter but they don&rsquo;t use it for the intended purpose. They use it to get high. Drugs can kill you,&rdquo; said Lucille.She said young people shouldn&rsquo;t use their backgrounds as an excuse to abuse drugs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to rise up and take responsibility for your lives. &ldquo;Young people are dying these days, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be that way.&rdquo; Library manager Mzukisi Njambathwa said: &ldquo;The library is also trying hard to tackle the drug problem.&ldquo;We run various programmes to warn young people about the dangers of substance abuse.&ldquo;We conduct the programmes during the school holidays.&rdquo;Jabulile Nkqenqa (13) said he learnt a lot and wouldn&rsquo;t touch drugs.He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I will never use drugs, and I&rsquo;ll stay away from people who use them. &ldquo;I always thought dagga was not that harmful, but today I&rsquo;ve learnt that it is also dangerous.&rdquo; Lucille told the young people that if they knew of anyone who was battling with drug addiction to refer them to social workers. &ldquo;We have social workers who work in the township.&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to tell them about the challenges you face in your area.&ldquo;We can work together to help drug addicts. Drugs are not the answer.&rdquo;
