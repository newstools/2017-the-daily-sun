AS the ANC knuckles down to reflect on the health of the party at its national policy conference, its Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has painted a picture of an organisation in ICU.Mantashe, in his diagnostic organisational report, reveals deep divisions that have ravaged the governing party. He says these seeds of discontent have encouraged it to attack individuals it perceived as enemies.The presentation of Mantashe&rsquo;s report came hours after President Jacob Zuma had lambasted veterans and stalwarts who had requested a consultative congress to mend the divisions within the party.The veterans have since boycotted the conference, and after refusing to engage the branches, complaining about the poor quality of delegates from within their ranks.But this drew the ire of Zuma, who told delegates in his address that the veterans had assumed they were more powerful than elected leaders.Said Zuma: &ldquo;They think they&rsquo;ve got power and everything. They told the SG (Mantashe) they don&rsquo;t think the quality of the discussion here is going to be at the (high) level.&rdquo;And even though the policy conference is not about leadership, the opening address gave a glimpse of leadership preferences.Eastern Cape delegates nearly came to blows with the pro-Zuma faction, comprising Mpumalanga, the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and the leagues.And despite delegates from the Eastern Cape not chanting anti-Zuma sentiment, they signalled for a change of leadership with soccer&rsquo;s substitution gestures.Through song, Eastern Cape delegates warned those who had pronounced on their preferred leadership, while the pro-Zuma camp kept asking what the president had done wrong.And this division is what underlined Mantashe&rsquo;s report.&ldquo;Although we deny it &ndash; because we know it&rsquo;s wrong &ndash; we are beginning to put personal interest ahead of the organisation,&rdquo; Mantashe said.&ldquo;We defy the party because factions say so. When the NEC takes a decision, which directs that only principles must be discussed on the succession question, comrades pronounce on their line-ups.&rdquo;Mantashe confirmed there were attempts to block the presentation of his report to the congress, saying he was eventually allowed to present it.At a later press conference, he told reporters the Guptas&rsquo; issue would be discussed, but insisted Zuma would not be asked to explain himself on his alleged implication as the conference was not a court.There&rsquo;s been persistent calls by the leadership that the limping party should emerge out of the conference united.But this remains to be seen.
