BLACK LEOPARDS boss, David Thidiela, plans to sue the South African Football Association (Safa) for defamation.&nbsp; Thidiela won his case on Thursday against Safa, who summoned him to appear before the Disciplinary Committee for bringing the game into disrepute.&nbsp; This was after Thidiela had lashed out at Safa in December last year over poor standards of refereeing, especially in the National First Division (NFD), where Leopards compete.&nbsp; Thidiela&rsquo;s rant refers to the appointment of a certain referee for Lidoda Duvha&rsquo;s match against Royal Eagles in Limpopo on the weekend of 17 and 18 December last year.&nbsp; The outspoken boss had sent a letter of complaint to Safa via the Premier Soccer League (PSL) about the same official&rsquo;s poor handling of their home match against Mbombela United on 19 November. Leopards beat Royal Eagles 2-1 and drew 2-2 with Mbombela.&nbsp; His outburst during a radio interview angered the mother body as they are in charge of the PSL and NFD referees.&nbsp; Safa CEO, Dennis Mumble, told SunSport Thidiela could face a lengthy ban from all soccer activities if found guilty.&nbsp; But the Leopards boss had the last laugh as all charges against him were dropped.&nbsp; Leopards&rsquo; lawyer Tinyiko Mnisi said they won&rsquo;t let the matter lie down as Safa had dragged his client&rsquo;s name through the mud. Said Mnisi: &ldquo;The case was finalised on Thursday and I can confirm that my client wasn&rsquo;t found guilty. Safa must pay all legal costs and face consequences.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll open a case of defamation against Safa. They made my client spend money unnecessarily
