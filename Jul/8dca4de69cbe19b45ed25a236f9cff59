DEPUTY police minister Bongani Mkongi declared war on thugs yesterday. Mkongi was angry when he visited Lingelethu cop shop in Cape Town, where thugs pretending to be robbery victims shot a cop last week. His visit came just as news broke that a cop had been killed in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, yesterday.Speaking to SAPS members, he said: &ldquo;Just three weeks ago, about five officers were gunned down by criminals in the Free State who were heavily armed.&rdquo; Mkongi spent a long time addressing top cops at Malibongwe Restaurant at Look Out Hill, Khayelitsha, where he told them the police were going to shoot criminals to kill. The cop injured during the attack at Lingelethu Police Station remains in a stable condition in hospital. Meanwhile in Gauteng, police launched a manhunt for suspects involved in two different shooting incidents. On Tuesday, a cop and a bystander in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, were wounded after people in a VW Polo started shooting when the cops pulled them over. One suspect was arrested and four others managed to flee. Speaking about the Vosloorus incident, Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police officers were on a routine patrol when they spotted a suspicious vehicle with a false registration number. When they approached the vehicle, a suspect opened fire, killing Warrant Officer Sipho Mthethwa. He said cops arrested two suspects and a third fled. Dlamini said the suspect on the run was believed to be Bongumusa Madondo, who escaped from the Joburg High Court two months ago. He has been linked to a number of ATM bombings.
