FOUR correctional services officials have been suspended, and nine others are in the firing line. This comes after photos of alleged strippers entertaining prisoners at Joburg Prison on Youth Day went viral on social media last week. Correctional services spokesman Logan Maistry said: “We can confirm that four officials were suspended following the incident at Joburg Prison. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssOZnqO2s0QJgsxdXZtH-IYM1czmujOxcElTtAAEjarZ4HJn_kSlu0iUmgmFfEMH9qfeIPHgqy6uMBrSjnoMt5s0ER29fokP_dRkEQI-RSDytHjn8uVsoWZ17hM44X0_UPmrNbu03VlzzIA1jA6jGrqZXV9uO0EOpNcoPe9lQMjdgROt0pyapsUVeGU-BhYxtu5-uEpn6_lLd9pc-oTbmk4DYzJgy5ME4wx6xxMYUoIGnlDgPQ11FzjGuWid06MzcZFBq2SwzMu6H7iyt9MVT9Bbhf5SIs\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDvb2b5qpRAGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Monica Venter, provincial manager at the association, said: “It’s unfortunate that social media took an innocent entertainment programme at the prison and turned it into something ugly. “Youth Day is celebrated every year at prisons, with various programmes. This year was no different. A programme was submitted to the area commissioner and was approved. “It’s unfortunate that what really happened that day was presented differently by ill-minded people with their own agenda.” Venter said the association was in possession of photos that proved the event wasn’t dirty.
