WITH the Absa Premiership being rated among the best in the world, most Mzansi footballers in Europe are coming back to The Motherland.&nbsp;Is this because the Premier Soccer League is now getting lucrative and competitive?Is it because they have failed abroad?Is it because they are home sick?&nbsp;Or are they coming back home because they can no longer cope with conditions in Europe?You be the judge!But there&rsquo;s an increasing number of South African players returning home every season after short periods in European leagues, and this is cause for concern.Ageing Steven Pienaar, Dylan Classen, Tefu Mashamaite, Darren Keet, Anele Ngcongca, Ayanda Patosi, Benni McCarthy, Kagiso Dikgacoi are some of the players who came back home in recent years.At this rate, Bafana Bafana will end up without European-based players.Former English Premiership outfit Everton and Sunderland star midfielder, Pienaar, leads the way ahead of the 2017/18 season.Pienaar, whose club Sunderland were relegated to the Championships Division, has come back home to finish his career with PSL champions Bidvest Wits.The former poster boy of South African football joined the Clever Boys on a one-year deal with an option to renew on Wednesday.Pienaar joined another Bafana star, Classen, in the Clever Boys camp, who singed from 1860 Munich in the German Bundesliga.McCarthy has graduated into head coach as he took Cape Town City top post having played at home at Orlando Pirates. SuperSport United lured former Kaizer Chiefs defender Mashamaite from Swedish based side BK Hacken in 2016.The lanky defender had only played in the Scandinavian country just for one season.&nbsp;Cape Town City landed the signature of 24-year-old Bafana midfielder Patosi from Lokeren FC in the Belgium league.Ngcongca, who joined Sundowns from Genk in Belgium in the 2016-17, said he came back home because of personal problems.The Brazilians defender, who spent nine years in Europe, did not get along with his club coach.Ngcongca said: &ldquo;I had a problem after the nine years I spent at Genk. I also came back because of family issues.&ldquo;It was also difficult for my daughter. I needed to be closer to my family &ndash; my mum was also not well.But at age 24, Patosi is still young he needed to stay there for a few years.I find it strange for him to return home so early. At this rate we won&rsquo;t have a Bafana player playing in Europe.&nbsp;Classen told SunSport: &ldquo;I came back to the PSL due to personal reasons. I spoke to my family first. I would have loved to stay, but family issues forced me to come home.&ldquo;Not because I can&rsquo;t make it overseas. I don&rsquo;t see it as a step backward.&rdquo;
