NOTHING beats a pure and honest artist who bares their soul for the audience.&nbsp;And Bongeziwe Mabandla does this exceptionally well through his second album, Mangaliso.This 11-track amazing body of work, aptly named for the musical wonder it is, has a modern feel about it, yet it gracefully captures traditional music elements that make it an absolute joy to listen to.And despite releasing his debut album Umlilo in 2012, the Afro-folk genre maverick reclaims his crown through his splendid storytelling ability and remarkable vocal delivery.Armed with his guitar and melodic, raw and authentic voice, Bongeziwe is a breath of fresh air in a sea of mediocre singers.And thanks to his dedication to stay true to his roots, the Eastern Cape star, born in Mthatha, embodies the best aspects of his Xhosa culture. And this has been key to helping him stand out.Speaking to SunBuzz, the reserved yet powerful musician said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say what inspired the album, as different tracks would come at different times. But Wena, one of the first songs I wrote, gave me some idea of where to direct my creativity because I was struggling with the overall concept.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s difficult writing your second album.&nbsp;&ldquo;My first one was easy, as it was autobiographical. Besides, musicians like myself strive to write really genuine music, but it&rsquo;s not that easy.&rdquo;Bongeziwe said he was pleased with how Mangaliso turned out because time was never on his side when working on it.&ldquo;I wrote while travelling, playing and touring. But it was interesting because this gave me the opportunity to tap into a whole new creative process,&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;Because I was on the road, I used whatever I had. I wrote on flights and hotel note pads.&nbsp;&ldquo;So, the album is about that process: finding fulfilment, happiness and freedom.&rdquo;Having worked with Tiago Correia Paulo, a guitarist from the legendary 340ml band who produced Mangaliso, Bongeziwe said he&rsquo;d also like a collaboration with greats the likes of Pops Mohammed, Oliver Mtukudzi, Ringo Madlingozi and Buhle from The Soil.Bongeziwe is billed for the upcoming Oppikoppi and Rocking The Daises festivals.&nbsp;
