MISS South Africa has received backlash on social media for giving food to underprivileged children wearing latex gloves. Nel-Peters was a volunteer at a Maslow Hotel soup kitchen, that was handing over food to 300 kids at a children's home in Ikageng Soweto. According to Nel-Peters, everyone at the event was wearing gloves for hygienic purposes as they were dealing with food. Following the accident Nel-Peters posted a video on Twitter to provide clarity on the gloves issue, "To everyone asking about the gloves, I truly hope that you'll hear my heart and understand that it came from a place of wanting to do good." Twitter was having none-of-it, as they expressed anger over the latex gloves and going to the point of calling her racist. Former Miss SA preparing food....
