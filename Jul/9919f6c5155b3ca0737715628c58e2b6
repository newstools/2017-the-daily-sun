They attacked me with stones and kicked me,&rdquo; said Zuko, who still has wounds on his head.According to police spokesman Captain Fredrick van Wyk, a case of assault was opened.&ldquo;No arrests have been made yet. The police are investigating,&rdquo; he said.Illegal connections have soured relations between the RDP owners and squatters. Nyakathisa community leader Siphokazi Fakela said: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t greet each other anymore or even look at each other. We walk in groups because they threaten us with violence. &ldquo;Recently I was taking my child to creche and walked past a house owner who said she wished I could step on a live wire and get electrocuted.&rdquo;Siphokazi said they used to get electricity from RDP owners for R500 a month. &ldquo;But many of us can&rsquo;t afford to pay R500. &ldquo;We know we are breaking the law by making illegal connections but we have no choice, because we need electricity,&rdquo; said Fakela.House owner Noluvo Ncedana (40) said her electricity bill shot up from R80 to more than R200 because of illegal connections.&ldquo;If they want electricity, they must talk to the City of Cape Town and leave our electricity alone.&rdquo;House owner and community leader Noncedo Speliti said illegal connections resulted in electricity outages, which affect the sick and the elderly.&ldquo;People who are diabetic can&rsquo;t keep insulin in the fridge and they become sick,&rdquo; said Noncedo.Anda Ntsodo, member of the mayoral committee for community services, said: &ldquo;Nyakathisa is located on a proclaimed road reserve and the city is unable to &shy;rezone to provide services on the site.&rdquo;
