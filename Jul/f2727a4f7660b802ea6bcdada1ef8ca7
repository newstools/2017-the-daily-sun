The veteran SuperSport United midfielder, who turned 35 last month, has no intention of hanging up his boots anytime soon.The former Kaizer Chiefs and Bafana Bafana midfield star laughs when talk of retirement comes up. &ldquo;There is no chance at all of me giving up. No ways!&rdquo; he stressed.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking about that. I&rsquo;m enjoying my football at SuperSport and will carry on as long as I can. Nobody will tell me when to retire &ndash; I will be the one to decide when it is time, not somebody else.&rdquo;Letsholonyane was an inspired buy by former Matsatsantsa a Pitori head coach Stuart Baxter, who signed the veteran midfield dynamo on a-two year deal last season when his contract at Chiefs expired.Most thought Yeye&rsquo;s days were numbered but the midfield workhorse proved his doubters wrong.Said the fit-looking Letsholonyane: &ldquo;I have no point to prove. I just want to get better every day. I left Chiefs for a new environment. People made a big deal out of it. It was not a big deal.&rdquo;Letsholonyane predicts there is more to come from him and United next season: &ldquo;We are gunning for the league title and other cups on offer.

Like me he is a midfielder and there is a lot he will teach me.&rdquo;Yeye is also looking forward to the season opener against his old teammates at Chiefs when the two teams lock horns in the quarterfinals of the MTN8 at FNB Stadium next month.
