CASTER SEMENYA the Olympic 800m champion, may be banned from competing at future Games unless she undergoes hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or even surgery in the wake of a landmark study into athletes with raised testosterone levels which has just been published.The International Association of Athletics Federations, the world governing body, commissioned research which has produced the most conclusive evidence yet that female athletes with very high levels of naturally occurring testosterone receive significant performance-enhancing benefits in competition.It comes only weeks before the IAAF is set to challenge a ruling by the court of arbitration for sport which, since 2015, has prevented it from restricting permitted levels of testosterone among female competitors.The new study will not stop Semenya and other hyperandrogenic athletes, such as the Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, from competing at the world championships in London in August but it could have a significant impact on the Cas hearing later this month.It is bound to reopen the controversial and emotionally charged debate around the treatment of female athletes with hyperandrogenism, a medical condition characterised by excessive levels of male sex hormones such as testosterone.Researchers measured blood testosterone levels in 1,332 female athletes competing across 21 track and field disciplines at the 2011 and 2013 world championships. Those with the highest levels of testosterone demonstrated significant advantages over those with the lowest levels &ndash; notably in the 400m (2.7% faster), the 400m hurdles (2.8% faster), the 800m (1.8% faster), the hammer throw (4.5% longer) and in the pole vault (2.9% higher).Although these margins appear small, at the highest level a performance boost of a few percentage points might mean the difference between winning gold and missing out on a medal.St&eacute;phane Bermon led the research from the Monaco Institute of Sports Medicine and Surgery, together with Dr Pierre-Yves Garnier, director of the IAAF health and science department. Bermon said: &ldquo;This study brings new evidence [of] the performance-enhancing effects of androgens in elite female athletes. Although long suspected [to be the case], until now there was no proof.&ldquo;Our starting position is to defend, protect and promote fair female competition.If, as the study shows, in certain events female athletes with higher testosterone levels can have a competitive advantage of between 1.8 and 4.5% over female athletes with lower testosterone levels, imagine the magnitude of the advantage for female athletes with testosterone levels in the normal male range.&rdquo;
