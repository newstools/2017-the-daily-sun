IT WAS a text message from hell! The woman&rsquo;s husband told her he had just killed their children. Precious Kadumba had to leave her three children aged 12, eight and five with him after she fled home in fear of her life. Early last month she went to stay with relatives in Harare, a five-hour drive away from her home in Birchenough Bridge, in Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Manicaland. But last Friday as she travelled home to fetch the children, she felt something was about to go terribly wrong. The husband kept calling her to find out where exactly they were along the way.&ldquo;I sensed danger because he would phone after short intervals,&rdquo; Precious told the Manica Post. &ldquo;He later sent me a message saying he had killed our children.&rdquo;When the mum arrived at her home town, she went straight to the police. &ldquo;We also phoned neighbours, who rushed there and found the house was on fire. They rescued the elder boy, but the other two were already dead,&rdquo; she said at her children&rsquo;s funeral this week. Twelve-year-old Tanaka is recovering in Manicaland&rsquo;s main hospital in Mutare. His father, Fashion Mupakati (42) ,is now reported to be on the run. But why did the mum leave her kids with her husband, recently released from jail after killing his girlfriend?&ldquo;I had to go and arrange for the children to join me,&rdquo; she said. &ndash; NEWS24
