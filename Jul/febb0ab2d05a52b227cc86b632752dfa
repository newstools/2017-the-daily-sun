SICK gogo Emily Mohaka (88) from Evaton North, near Vanderbijlpark, wants the truth from her late son&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; The gogo claims she was kicked out of his house a day after the funeral. &ldquo;I will not rest until I know the truth,&rdquo; said gogo Emily. &ldquo;Before I die I want to know why she threw me out of my son&rsquo;s house the day after he was laid to rest. &ldquo;I do not care about the inheritance. I just need my son&rsquo;s soul to be at peace so that when I meet him in heaven one day, he will know that I have settled things for him here on earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The family of Samuel Mohaka, who was 44 when he died in 2008, are supporting their mother&rsquo;s determination to find out the truth about Samuel&rsquo;s relationship with Christina Mohlala (44). Christina told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I met my husband in 1994. We had a child together in 2002.&nbsp; &ldquo;His family visited my family in 2006 to pay lobola and my husband died in 2008.&rdquo; Samuel&rsquo;s sister, Rose Mohaka (57), claimed the marriage certificate and lobola notes were not genuine. She said her brother&rsquo;s death certificate says he was not married. She claimed they were not aware of the lobola process. &ldquo;We do not know the child she claims is my brother&rsquo;s child. As black people we do rituals to accept a newborn into the family and none of those procedures were done for her child.&rdquo;&nbsp;
