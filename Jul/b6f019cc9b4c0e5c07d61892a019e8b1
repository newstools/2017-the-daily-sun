AUDREY Baloyi is a sad mum. Her son, Karabo Maluleka (18), died in hospital.Audrey believes if nurses at Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane had attended to him in time, he would still be alive.The 40-year-old mum from Block HH, Soshanguve said it pains her to know she will never see her son again.She claimed Karabo died because the nurses neglected him. &ldquo;Karabo complained of stomach ache and I took him to the local clinic last Wednesday,&rdquo; said Audrey.&ldquo;Nurses said he had a liver problem, and he was referred to the hospital for immediate attention.&rdquo; She said they arrived at the hospital at about 9am and when she asked for a doctor, she was told they had no doctors for Karabo&rsquo;s condition.&ldquo;We waited for hours and when the nurses finally attended to him, they said the doctors had already left.&rdquo;They were told to come back the next day. &ldquo;When we arrived on Thursday morning, Karabo was checked by nurses and later a student doctor attended to him. But the doctor said we had to wait for a qualified doctor to see him.&rdquo; She said the doctor came at 10pm and he admitted him immediately.&ldquo;They told me my son was going to be taken for an emergency operation at midnight and I went home. Even though I was worried, I was relieved to think that when I saw him again, he&rsquo;d be better and the pain would be gone.&rdquo; When she said goodbye to Karabo, she had no idea it would be the last time she saw him alive.&ldquo;I received a call that shattered my life on Friday morning. A nurse told me that Karabo had died on his way to the operating room,&rdquo; she said.Vuyo Sabani, spokesman for the Gauteng Health Department, said they would fully investigate the matter.He said they had contacted the family and would have a meeting with them, but the family was not available at the time.&ldquo;The hospital will continue to liaise with the family to resolve the matter.&rdquo;
