NATHI Mthethwa has said that to say there is no white monopoly capital in South Africa is a lie.&ldquo;But we have warned our comrades about how to address this in the right manner. Our attitude to monopoly capital shouldn&rsquo;t change and will not change,&rdquo; said Mthethwa, the ANC&rsquo;s chairman of the NEC subcommittee on strategy and tactics.He was addressing the media at the ANC&rsquo;s national policy conference at Nasrec, outside Soweto.He said they lost elections because they didn&rsquo;t address issues they should have addressed. &ldquo;We are at our weakest since 1994 as an alliance and we need to address this.&rdquo;Mthethwa said this change was in the hands of the ANC and that the perception that liberation movements stall after independence was not factual. According to Zwelinzima Vavi, the governing party was trying to shift blame by claiming service delivery protests were funded by the West.Vavi, general secretary of the South African Federation of Trade Unions, said the ANC&rsquo;s diagnosis report on forces of regime change was a dangerous threat to citizens and civil society.Vavi said the document was an attempt to shift the blame for ANC failure onto those who are the main victims of the failure. &ldquo;What is dangerous is that the document is preparing the ground to crack down on all the protests.&rdquo;
