NATASHA Williams (32) of Malabar kasi, Northern Areas, Port Elizabeth is a street sweeper with style!She wraps plastic refuse bags around her waist, just like a Shangaan woman ready for a traditional dance. People in cars hoot while others stare and take photographs.Natasha told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I am employed by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. &ldquo;I am getting a lot more attention than my colleagues. At first I thought people were unhappy with the way I swept the streets.&ldquo;But then I realised that motorists were hooting because they were praising my plastic skirt. Since then, I&rsquo;ve decided to dress like this. &ldquo;The skirt was meant to protect my overalls because vehicles make us dirty.&rdquo; But it has made her a kind of celebrity. &ldquo;People ask me where I bought my skirt or if I made it myself. I always tell them the truth: they are refuse bags around my waist.&ldquo;While I work, people love to take my picture. I&rsquo;m not doing this to be sexy, it just makes my job easier. Wrapping that plastic around my waist allows me to finish quickly.&rdquo; But Natasha will soon lose her celebrity status. &ldquo;This is a two-month contract. I will miss these moments.&rdquo; Boy Nontshinga (41) of KwaZakhele said: &ldquo;I was driving and saw her. She looks like a Shangaan woman ready to dance and I love her.&rdquo;
