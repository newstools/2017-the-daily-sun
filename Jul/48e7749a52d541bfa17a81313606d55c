IT&rsquo;S always better to be safe than sorry! And Wilbert Mabika (47) from Lower Crossroads, Cape Town doesn&rsquo;t take chances. He wants his bakkie to be safe from thugs and a garage alone is not enough.So Wilbert chains his bakkie to the gate of his house every day to make sure thugs can&rsquo;t steal it! He told the SunTeam he noticed two weeks that someone was trying to steal his wheels and that&rsquo;s when he decided to act quickly.&ldquo;I did not hear anything as I was asleep and that made me realise that one day they would get away with my car.&rdquo; He said now that he chained his bakkie up, he knew that if someone tried to steal it, he would quickly hear because the chain would make a noise and alert him. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be able to steal it now. &ldquo;It is safe,&rdquo; said Wilbert. His wife, Mavis Kama, said when her husband first talked about chaining the bakkie, she was not sure if it would be helpful but she had realised it was a good idea.&ldquo;Thieves will have to think twice before stealing this car.&rdquo; A neighbour, Mxolisi Sikhomo, said he laughed when he first saw the car chained to the gate but after some explanation, he understood the reason. &ldquo;At first I laughed so hard because I did know the reason behind it,&rdquo; said Mxolisi. He said he thought it was a good idea for people to keep their cars safe by chaining them to their security gates.However, he said they must make sure the gates were strong and wouldn&rsquo;t be dragged off if thieves stole the vehicles.
