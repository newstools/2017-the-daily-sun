WITH about 85 buildings having been hijacked by illegal occupants in Joburg, a disaster was inevitable, Mayor Herman Mashaba said earlier today.&ldquo;For anyone who was with me a few weeks ago, this fire was bound to happen,&rdquo; he said, wearing a yellow hard hat in front of the Cape York building in the central business district.A fire at the hijacked building forced a man to jump to his death, while six others died of smoke inhalation.Seven others were rushed to hospital, some with burn wounds to their hands and feet.More than 50 people were rescued from the building using a crane with a ladder.Residents also tied sheets together and dropped them out the windows in a desperate attempt to escape.&ldquo;What is disturbing is this fire in this particular building is not going to be an isolated case, unless civil society can allow me as executive mayor to condemn these buildings and get people out so that we can actually save their lives,&rdquo; said Mashaba.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele said the bodies of some victims were burned beyond recognition. An inquest docket would be opened to determine the cause of the fire.Public safety MMC Michael Sun said they were negotiating with the private building owner to take charge.It was understood there was an ongoing court battle.Sun said such buildings were extremely dangerous because people were using illegal electrical connections there.&ldquo;Yet we find women, the sick and elderly occupying the buildings,&rdquo; he said.Public safety and disaster management officials would provide the victims with food, clothing, blankets and emergency shelter.Mashaba took a slightly different tone, however, saying the occupants could not expect to jump any housing lists.The council was not going to allow anyone to hijack buildings in the thought they could jump the queue.&ldquo;If you are looking for a house and believe you qualify, please register on the list,&rdquo; the mayor said.
