ALTHOUGH a man accused of multiple murders and attempted murders is behind bars, people are furious. Residents of Rondebult, Ekurhuleni, said yesterday they were angry that they&rsquo;d been living with a monster in their area. They protested outside the Germiston Magistrates Court, demanding that the suspect should not be granted bail. He was making his first appearance after he was arrested over the weekend and charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and several counts of murder and attempted murder.People suspected that community leader Nikiwe Lutshiti had been shot dead by the man and his friend Sakhile Nconco, who was killed in a shoot-out with cops. Cops said the suspect shot and wounded a man on Thursday night. He is also believed to have shot at a family of four last Tuesday, killing an eight-year-old kid. Last month, he allegedly shot four people dead and wounded others. Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said: &ldquo;We linked him to 13 murders. He may be linked to more cases as we investigate.&rdquo;
