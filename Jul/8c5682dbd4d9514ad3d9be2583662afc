WITH just four teams left in the SuperSport Rugby Challenge Western Province, with their 26-0 shutout of a game but outclassed Free State XV, are still seen as the team to beat in a competition which also features the Golden Lions, the Blue Bulls and Griquas.Province are up against the Bulls in the second semi-final (3pm) at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium, while the Lions go up against a team which has dented many a reputation en route to booking its place in the last four, Griquas.Owing to their ability to keep teams at arm&rsquo;s length when in tough games or simply finding on-field solutions in those matches, Province have earned the right to be expected to advance to the final, especially considering how off-colour the Bulls were in their lucky win against the Sharks XV in their quarterfinal.Free State XV coach MJ Smith, who admitted his team had been outplayed in their last eight game against Province and failed to adjust as well when the rain came down in the second half, was one of the Cape Town side&rsquo;s staunchest advocates.&ldquo;I saw the Bulls play, there&rsquo;s just too much power overall from Province that the opponent has to manage in defence,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Western Province are playing well, whether it&rsquo;s their scrums, their lineouts ... everything is going well and they&rsquo;ve got quick backs.&nbsp;&ldquo;So the overall game Province brings is too much for the Bulls.&rdquo;The other semifinal features the free-scoring but young and inexperienced Lions (they&rsquo;ve scored 75 tries in nine games so far, including six in their quarterfinal against the Pumas), who are up against a full strength Currie Cup side from Griquas, who have embarrassed the Free State and Sharks XV and the EP Kings in their quest for a last four place.&ldquo;I think the Lions will be a difficult side, but Griquas are playing their Currie Cup side so I&rsquo;ll back Griquas there,&rdquo; was Smith&rsquo;s decisive prediction.&nbsp;But while Sharks XV coach Paul Anthony is tempted to agree as his team lost their first encounter against Griquas and could only draw the second, his instincts were that the Lions had played tough teams in the Bulls and the Pumas in their approach to the semifinal.&ldquo;Griquas are a tough team,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have to have your wits about you because they&rsquo;re quite an experienced side. Whoever plays them have to man up defensively. They do leak tries but they&rsquo;re very solid and they&rsquo;re very strong on attack.&nbsp;&ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s a team that can beat Griquas I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the Lions because they&rsquo;ve had a good run in.&rdquo;Province&rsquo;s forwards coach, former Springbok hooker Hanyani Shimange, said drawing the Bulls for an impromptu North v South derby in Mdantsane, of all places, wasn&rsquo;t an issue for them: &ldquo;At one stage we were supposed to play Border in the play-off game again then the Cheetahs came up.&nbsp;&ldquo;For us it doesn&rsquo;t really matter because we&rsquo;ve built good momentum and if you&rsquo;re going to win you&rsquo;re going to have to do well and be able to face anything. "It&rsquo;s going to be a challenge, it&rsquo;s always tough playing against the Bulls &ndash; they also had a courageous win with 14 men &ndash; so it&rsquo;s going to be a challenge in a unique environment.&rdquo;Bulls coach Pote Human almost sounded relieved with the fact that the game wouldn&rsquo;t be played in Cape Town: &ldquo;It would be different if we&rsquo;d had to play Province here, it would have been a big ask.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp;
