THE grandson of a 79-year-old woman has been arrested in connection with her murder in Rooseenekal, Limpopo police said earlier today. "It is alleged that the deceased &hellip; was attacked and killed while sleeping in her house by unknown people who used a variety of objects," said Lieutenant-Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. The woman&rsquo;s body was found in her home just outside Groblersdal in May. However, police only made the first arrest this weekend &ndash; and revealed the alleged family connection behind the murder. A police investigation revealed that the grandson and another family member had disappeared after the grandmother&rsquo;s funeral. A manhunt was then launched, which led to the arrest in Mpumulanga. "Preliminary investigations have further uncovered that the motive behind this incident was a conspiracy to kill the deceased to acquire her property valued at millions of rands," said Ngoepe. Another arrest is imminent, said police. The suspect will appear in the Groblersdal Magistrate's Court tomorrow on a charge of murder. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba thanked dedicated police for cracking a complicated case within a short space of time. "Members of the community must refrain and stop this tendency of killing each other for money or for any other benefit, and also to try and mislead the police, because they cannot hide and we will take such people to where they belong," said Ledwaba.
