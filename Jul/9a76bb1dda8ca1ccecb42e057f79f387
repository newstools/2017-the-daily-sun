At night I would feel something touching my thighs and slowly moving towards my 4-5, like someone was rubbing me. When I opened my eyes I would see a short creature with a wig and red lipstick smiling at me. Then all of a sudden it would disappear into thin air. “The evil creature would wildly play with my 4-5. I went to two sangomas but they couldn’t help me. Instead they said someone wants me to hang myself. They just gave me water and muthi to put under my bed. That never helped.“In my dreams I often saw my gogo pushing me towards a toilet seat and smiling. So I started collecting toilet buckets and putting them around my garden. Since I have had these toilets, my evil tormentor doesn’t come anymore.” Sangoma Mamoya Rakauoane said: “Tshepiso was given instructions by his ancestors.”
