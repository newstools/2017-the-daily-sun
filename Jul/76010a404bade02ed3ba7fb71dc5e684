WHEN Tryphina Mciga (41) saw a poster on a street pole advertising a room for rent, she and her husband jumped at the opportunity.&nbsp; They phoned the advertiser who introduced himself as Lebogang, a cop, and after visiting the room in Kempton Park last Thursday, they arranged to move in on Saturday.&nbsp; But when Tryphina arrived to move in, she found eight other people already queuing for the room. And when a 10th person arrived, they realised they had been conned by the fong kong cop. Police said the man tricked at least 10 people. He made them all pay for the room after claiming it was his to rent out. Kempton Park police spokesman, Captain Jethro Mtshali, said detectives are hoping the community will help them find the person in the picture. He said the suspect, who called himself Lebogang, is alleged to have put up posters in Monument Road in Kempton Park, advertising a flat for rent in Kempton Road. Tryphina said when she arrived on Saturday, she called Lebogang and someone opened the gate for her. &ldquo;We were let inside and found eight people queuing for the same room.&nbsp; &ldquo;While we were still there, a 10th man joined the queue &ndash; he had also paid the fake cop.&rdquo; Tryphina said when she called Lebogang again, his phone was switched off.&nbsp; &ldquo;We then went to the police station and opened a case. &ldquo;I believed everything he told me because he showed me a police appointment card. I didn&rsquo;t doubt him. &ldquo;I was desperate for a place to stay and I paid for the room after viewing it.&rdquo; Another victim, Adgobe Alici, said: &ldquo;I spent money on a truck to move my stuff from my place in Joburg CBD to Kempton Park, but when I arrived, there was no room and no owner.&rdquo; Mtshali said that the police were investigating cases of fraud and impersonating a police officer. Anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the man should contact their nearest cop shop.
