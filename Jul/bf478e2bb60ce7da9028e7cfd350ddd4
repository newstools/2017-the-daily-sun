IT WAS in December when I last saw Orlando Pirates in full force.A four-man heavy artillery squadron, led by Colonel Irvin&nbsp;Khoza, had invaded the SABC studios. Khoza&rsquo;s flat-back four had technical director, Stanley &ldquo;Screamer&rdquo; Tshabalala, and club official, Floyd Mbele, in their element and spitting fire.Even the aging coach, Augusto Palacios, with his crooked spinal cord, hobbled along to the public broadcasters HQ in Auckland Park.They had visited the SABC towers to seek a right of reply after one of the broadcaster&rsquo;s journalists had apparently &ldquo;wronged&rdquo; the Pirates officials by not offering them a right of reply.The Khoza-led ensemble were fearsome, forthright and frightening in their approach and fought their cause like a bunch of winners. They left the SABC studios in smithereens and resembled the Pirates side that won the treble.If only Pirates officials could channel that kind of fighting spirit to the current crop of players who continue to embarrass the once-mighty Buccaneers. To put it bluntly, and without flinching, the current crop of Pirates players are a bunch of donkeys! They don&rsquo;t deserve to don the historic black-and-white strip after the generation of Lucky Lekgwathi, Siyabonga Sangweni, Moeneeb Josephs, Andile Jali, Benni McCarthy and Thulasizwe Mbuyane had given Pirates die-hards bragging rights when they dominated and won the treble.The Pirates darlings of yesteryear Nick &ldquo;Bazooka&rdquo; Sishweni, Ernest &ldquo;Botsotso&rdquo; Makhanya, Percy &ldquo;Chippa-Chippa&rdquo; Moloi, Lesley &ldquo;Slow Poison&rdquo; Manyathela, Senzo Meyiwa died for Bucs &ndash; literally and figuratively &ndash; and must be turning in their graves after what is the worst season since the start of the PSL era.&nbsp;Pirates are in shambles, and need to come up with a plan, fast!THE office also seems to be in a state of disarray. One can&rsquo;t tell who does what and who&rsquo;s responsible for what. E-mailed requests to interview either players, the coach or technical team members get ignored.&nbsp;Players are alleged to be serious party animals in the red-lights districts of Mzansi on the eve of big matches.One can&rsquo;t blame poor Kjell Jonevret.The man seems to have been yanked from his daily job as a washed-up comic book author in Sweden.Coming from the ice-cold Scandanavia, he wasn&rsquo;t going to say no to sunny South Africa and to a great chance of bumping up his salary.Like they say, if you don&rsquo;t take chances, you&rsquo;re not going to win the Lotto &ndash; so, I forgive Jonevret.It&rsquo;s going to take some doing to bring back the glory days of 1995, when Gavin &ldquo;Stability Unit&rdquo; Lane, Mark Fish, Jerry &ldquo;Legs of Thunder&rdquo; Sikhosana, Edward &ldquo;Ma-Gents&rdquo; Motale, Williams Okpara and Brendon Silent, conquered the African continent.If things don&rsquo;t change, Bucs are going to fight for relegation next season. They weren&rsquo;t far off this past term after a mere six league wins. &nbsp;Maybe, it&rsquo;s high time the Colonel and his generals attacked matters on the pitch with the same chutzpah as they addressed the SABC situation &ndash; or give a dishonourable discharge to all the playing staff.
