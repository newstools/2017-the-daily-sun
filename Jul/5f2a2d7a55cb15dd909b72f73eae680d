COPS in Mozambique's Zambezia province have reportedly
moved to beef up their operation "to crack down on increased murders of
bald men".According to BBC, Zambezia police spokesperson Miguiel
Caestano said the plan was to focus on the people behind the killings."The main criminals are people from neighbouring
countries, chiefly Malawi, Tanzania and the Great Lakes region," Caestano
was quoted as saying.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstpKgCuf0c5Eaew5nNd9OxIpLL1SrreRCT0A4y4lrwpKrwQelJKFqNodWkXmivmJDerAp3OoFZJrlS_slaOHcvp9_38g1uDcKAgDeSUDDW_saLUbkIbKi_o-jwJ6mFQYnEPWLGQrp00E2WzHVwXkyAoaXsnd0VI9jBMVvWNZ8JOB3Pza8OzG4ojyLItL7cpbmNFlTMgjwOxHA6DbdXBPpYsZwkUBt619vokRNhLWAq4NAZUTNr2WzAslcXNmr1pq-qf3ZVHROSJCnntynhMKmB8QRqkoBeWNpM2Xg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIULnelF_HpfEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

were killed in Milange, in the centre of the southern African country, a few
kilometres from the border with Malawi.Police warmed at the time that bald people were likely to
be targets of ritual attacks.The two bald men, one of whom was found with his head cut
off and organs removed, were killed in a part of the country already notorious
for the persecution of albinos.According to statements, the organs were to be used by
healers in rituals to promote the fortunes of clients in Tanzania and Malawi.It was the first time that bald people were victims of
such attacks in the region, Caetano said.Â http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/mozambique-police-beef-up-security-to-protect-bald-men-amid-ritual-attacks-20170704
