CONVICTED killer Sindisiwe Manqele allegedly wants the creature comforts of home in her jail cell.&nbsp; This as the accused, sentenced to 12 years in prison last year in March for killing her lover and hip hop star Flabba (real name Nkululeko Habedi), had allegedly demanded a laptop and web access.&nbsp; This week, she filed an urgent application with the South Gauteng High Court to force the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Michael Masutha, to grant her these privileges.&nbsp; In her affidavit, seen by the SunTeam, Sindisiwe insists the two items are important for her to complete her higher certificate in law, for which she has registered with the University of South Africa.&nbsp; Her court papers read, in part: &ldquo;I have submitted a request to be allowed a laptop and a modem for my study purpose on 3 July 2017, and have since not received any feedback on the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I also wish to bring this to your attention that my academic year has started and I&rsquo;m lagging behind with my studies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Further delay would result in me being unable to cope with the required performance for my progress and development.&rdquo;&nbsp; To strengthen her case, Sindisiwe said she was also registered for online modules, for which there was no printed study material.&nbsp; &ldquo;All material is sent electronically and has to be downloaded, creating a need for it to be stored in a laptop.&rdquo; Sindisiwe insisted.&nbsp; She also stated that she didn&rsquo;t understand why she hadn&rsquo;t been granted the material because other inmates had, on previous occasions, been allowed access to such tools.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is on the basis of court rulings in favour of fellow inmate students using laptops, specifically Regina Kgafela, Loraine Ndlovu, Bridgette Nxele and Venise Fisher, among others, in this correctional centre.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said she would be prejudiced if she was denied access to the items as she studied at night, weekends and public holidays.&nbsp; Departmental spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said: &ldquo;The correctional service&rsquo;s legal department is to receive court papers and will respond accordingly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
