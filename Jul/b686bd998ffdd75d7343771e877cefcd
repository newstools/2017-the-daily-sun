Dear MizzBI am a 14-year-old girl who hates her life.  I cry myself to sleep every night and I sometimes think that if I just close my eyes and don’t open them again, my parents will stop fighting.  if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv-GId-scQse-MtDhASD-Xn9sY4eYbEg4ST6nta5G69KbqEaNCv7Ez7PWOyhFQeIXDx1admJrJ0QOmfXmbNJUsbrHwUKOqKsEKsU5ZaKokNRLO8Y1nbRbzX2M9f9gq1dd6LzhNSm0XeLbPh11PcssdfGDei0Q1mvi798kA2PbJ5eHdsYQ5xebgyhJx6v5mApMlEndYsljQ5or8vynIkPff7tEGwbDi3oXZUF9s6WSYmeodLEu38K_OD97ABRBV2rEDAtyVmW2INwdFlU_xq9FY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzDbHvKYWAf2AEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

It is important to remember that what happens between your parents is not your fault. You are not responsible for your parents’ behaviour. Your biggest responsibility is to be a child. This means discovering who you are and who you want to be. Find a hobby and meet friends who bring out the best in you. Talk to one of your parents when they are calm and tell them how you feel about their constant fighting. Change your world by protecting your mind.
