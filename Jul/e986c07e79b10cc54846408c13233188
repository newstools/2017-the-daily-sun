EXPERIENCED drinkers know not to have more than one shot of the strong home-brewed alcohol known as Tototo. However, two 53-year-old boozers ignored this wisdom on Friday night and ended up paying with their lives. The men drank four shots of tototo each at a tavern in Tambo section of Bekkersdal, west of Joburg. Then they started vomiting before passing out and dying. Maria da Silva, the owner of Tototo Tavern, told Daily Sun: &ldquo;They vomited in my shack &ndash; there was blood all over.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dangerous to drink more than one shot of Tototo. I always warn my patrons about it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mixture of sugarcane and brown sugar, boiled in a pot. The alcohol drops into a bucket.&rdquo; Phillip Mzamane (50) told Daily Sun he and a woman bought the men shots, and now regretted it. After hearing about the incident, community leader Neliswa Manesi (46) went to Bekkersdal Police Station and told cops they needed to ban Tototo. Sergeant Linki Lefakane said an inquest docket was opened and a sample of the brew was sent to be tested. &ldquo;We have to investigate the circumstances that led to this tragedy. I will update the SunTeam after the test has been done,&rdquo; she said. The relatives of Mpho Skhosana, one of the victims, arrived at the police station. Mpho&rsquo;s brother, David Kolo (42), said: &ldquo;The owner of the tavern needs to tell us what this Tototo really is.&rdquo;
