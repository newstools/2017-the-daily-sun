NEWLY-SIGNED Amazulu lethal striker, Mhlengi Cele, is accused of being a soccer age-cheat.The striker from Eshowe in KwaZulu-Natal, who played for Thanda Royal Zulu last season and was the National First Division&rsquo;s top goalscorer last season, was allegedly using his younger brother&rsquo;s identity.According to sources, Mhlengi&rsquo;s real name is Lindani Cele and is said to be 33 years old. The source claimed the name Mhlengi belonged to his 29-year-old brother.The source further alleged the striker was playing for Enyimba FC in the amateur level and attended school at Gawozi High School.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s known that Lindani is his real name. We went to school with him. So, when he got a contract to play for a Premier Soccer League team, he chose to change his identity to that of his younger brother. Sometimes, he even forgets that he&rsquo;s now using his younger brother&rsquo;s identity and corrects us when we call him Mhlengi instead of Lindani.Mhlengi became a top goalscorer last season, banging in 18 goals which helped Thanda get promoted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wrong to lie about your age. Age-cheating is killing our football. He must use his original age and stop this nonsense,&rdquo; said the source, who played with Mhlengi at amateur level.Mhlengi is not the first player to be accused of age-cheating. The late Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper, Senzo Meyiwa, was also accused of age-cheating shortly after his death. Mhlengi&rsquo;s younger brother Thokozani confirmed his brother was using his other brother&rsquo;s identity, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the youngest. He&rsquo;s the oldest. Lindani (Mhlengi) is the first born and Mhlengi is the second born.&rdquo;When called to comment, Mhlengi said: &ldquo;Yes, my real name is Lindani. There&rsquo;s a reason why this happened. Please, call me after 2pm, I&rsquo;m in a meeting. I&rsquo;ll explain everything.&rdquo;But when we tried again, we couldn&rsquo;t get hold of him at the time of going to print.Lindani refused to comment.
