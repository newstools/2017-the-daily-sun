THIS year&rsquo;s annual Moshito Music Conference and Exhibition aims to talk to young people who may not find relevance in African tradition.It will take place at the Soweto Theatre from 6 to 9 September.Moshito is a music platform created for music practitioners, producers and distributors, including everyone who plays a major role in the music business.It&rsquo;s also a networking platform that enables local artists to exchange ideas, explore new developments in the music industry. This event was founded 14 years ago and has birthed many young talented artists.Speaking to SunBuzz, Dr Sipho Sithole said artists attending the conference would benefit in more ways than one.&ldquo;Firstly, they get to meet music industry practitioners like record label owners, events organisers and artists&rsquo; managers. From this interaction, some independent artists get signed.&ldquo;This year, we have chosen Candy Tsa Mandebele and Dizu Plaatjies to be our faces because of their deep African roots,&rdquo; he said.
