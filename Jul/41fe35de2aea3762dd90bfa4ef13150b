AWARD-WINNING house music maestro, DJ Bongz, seems to be standing up for himself lately against those who allegedly use and fail to give him credit where its due.&nbsp; Before making a shocking announcement this week that he was finally leaving Mabala Noise Entertainment, the DJ took to social media to lash out at Smirnoff for using his Gwaragwara dance to promote their product without crediting or paying him a cent.&nbsp; He sounded very disappointed and rather angry in the post where he made damning accusations that he was used.&nbsp; This after Smirnoff SA had posted on Twitter, advertising their Smirnoff Electric product using different dance styles, including the Gwaragwara.&nbsp; The DJ, whose real name is Bongani Dlamini, took to social media to lash out at Smirnoff.&nbsp; The DJ, who calls himself &ldquo;Mr Gwaragwara&rdquo;, wrote: We work hard. We make things famous. They ride on the wave but we don&rsquo;t get credit nor a single cent. But we&rsquo;ll keep doing it because we do it for the people and the love of music, dance and entertainment.&nbsp; Am I lying if I say when you think of the word Gwargwara, DJ Bongz comes to mind? Even children know who the master behind Gwaragwara is. It&rsquo;s painful but I will never be discouraged. I love you all at home and you Smirnoff.&nbsp; Both DJ Bongz and Smirnoff could not be reached for comment.
