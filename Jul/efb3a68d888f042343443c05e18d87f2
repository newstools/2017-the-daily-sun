They were for healing.”The man in the pictures eating the yellow chrysanthemums looks a bit anxious but he doesn’t defy the pastor. He bites the flower, ends up with petals in his mouth, and then swallows. It was not immediately clear whether eating the flowers gave him a surge of spiritual power.Getting his congregation to eat unusual treats to help them with their problems is not the only thing Pastor Lesego offers his congregation.He has also been captured on video praying in tongues.In 2015, he told the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities Rights Commission: “When I do things, it is no longer me, but me and my Master. I was led by the Holy Spirit.” Hugo de Klerk is a florist at Teleflorist Africa and he said some flowers are poisonous.“Some flowers, like roses and a few others, are edible and can be eaten. But others, like lilies, will make you sick. Some flowers are even poisonous,” said Hugo.The People’s Paper tried to get hold of the pastor all day yesterday via e-mail, SMS and phone, but he had not responded by the time of going to press.
