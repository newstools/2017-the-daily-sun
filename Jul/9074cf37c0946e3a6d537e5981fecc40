CAMERAS may have stopped rolling for former Generations and Rhythm City star Dumisani Mbebe, but the drama from his characters has allegedly spilled into his life.&nbsp; This as he was allegedly expelled from his Woodland Gardens love nest in North Riding, north of Jozi, on Wednesday morning, insiders said.&nbsp; According to sources, the lovers&rsquo; tiff centred around the&nbsp; actor-turned-businessman splurging on his &ldquo;many&rdquo; side dishes.&nbsp; Said the first mole: &ldquo;Things between them have been sour for about two years. But alarm bells went off about a year ago, when Dumisani stopped bringing money home from his acting gigs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a &ldquo;confused&rdquo; Mbali denied there was any conflict between them when contacted on Thursday.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder who told you our address, but I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo; Mbali said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever told you this is lying, I was in Durban on Wednesday.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a second source begged to differ, saying things &ldquo;really got ugly&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was calling him all sorts of names and throwing his clothes outside. We tried to convince her to resolve the problem quietly indoors, but she&rsquo;d have none of it,&rdquo; the source insisted.&nbsp; The source said: &ldquo;This guy has neglected his financial duties, leaving his poor wife to pay for all their bills.&rdquo;&nbsp; The source insisted that a gatvol Mbali was pushed to the point of no return this week, resulting in her tossing the actor&rsquo;s clothes out of their townhouse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, the situation turned personal and got out of hand when she claimed he was broke. Police were called to difuse the situation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Douglasdale police spokesperson captain Mpho Kgosana confirmed that the police were called to the scene to intervene.&nbsp; &ldquo;No case was opened by the parties involved,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Dumisani was not available for comment and also failed to respond to our SMSes.
