THE king of Kwaito&rsquo;s son, Arthur, aka DJ AJ, has opened his heart!&nbsp; He told the SunTeam about the pain his family WAs going through.&nbsp; Three weeks ago, his dad Arthur Mafokate made headlines when his lover Cici opened a case of assault against him.&nbsp; He is currently out on bail.&nbsp; Sunday Sun has learnt that AJ was scheduled to release his latest album, but had to postpone the event to support his &ldquo;depressed&rdquo; dad.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes wish I wasn&rsquo;t Arthur&rsquo;s son because of his demanding life,&rdquo; said AJ.&nbsp; This week, Instagram went crazy after his dad posted a pic of AJ and one of Mzansi&rsquo;s hottest IT girls &ndash; Muvhango actress Buhle Samuels.&nbsp; &ldquo;People started calling, asking about the album, but I guess the timing is wrong. My dad is in a depressed mode and I have to be there for him. Yes, my career has to flourish, but I was raised to believe that family comes first.&rdquo;&nbsp; AJ says the Mafokates need to be strong during this period.&nbsp; &ldquo;God willing, one day this will be behind us,&rdquo; said Arthur&rsquo;s only son &ndash; who also wished Cici a speedy recovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw them both on that fateful day and all seemed fine until I got a call from my grandmother who told me what had happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; AJ&rsquo;s latest album, Legacy Vol, also features the likes of Kelly Khumalo, Cici and Ntombi Mzolo. It&rsquo;s a themed album inspired by the type of people featured on it.&nbsp; Arthur refused to comment on the matter, saying AJ has the right to say anything. Buhle was not available for comment.
