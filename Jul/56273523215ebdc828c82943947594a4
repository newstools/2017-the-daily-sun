ZIMBABWE is widely known for its economic and cash crisis. The banking system in that country has been crippled by the worsening liquidity crises and cash shortages.However, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe appears to still be living large.&nbsp;Mugabe's office spent more than $50 million on foreign travel last year, official figures show. According to a financial statement published in the latest government gazette, foreign travel expenses totalled $53.2 million in 2016.According to the figures in the "Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance of the Consolidated Revenue Fund", this was way above the $23 million initially allocated for travel under last year&rsquo;s budget.The private Financial Gazette paper, citing treasury figures, on Thursday reported that Mugabe&rsquo;s office had already spent $34.4 million on travel by October.&nbsp;The allocation for foreign travel expenses exceeded those made to other key ministries and institutions, the paper said. By comparison, only $30 million was allocated to parliament and $35 million to the industry ministry.Mugabe&rsquo;s numerous foreign trips are criticised by opponents as unnecessary at a time the government is struggling to pay wages and properly equip public hospitals.&nbsp;The 93-year-old was earlier this week in Addis Ababa for an African Union summit, where he handed over a cheque for $1 million to the bloc raised from the sale of donated Zimbabwean cattle.http://www.news24.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/mugabe-foreign-trips-cost-cash-strapped-zim-50-million-20170707
