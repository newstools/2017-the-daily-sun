MLUNGU Peter Stols (60) has been renting out his house to magoshas for a while now.They pay him R15 per session, which he adds to the little he makes to support himself.But now cops are allegedly harassing him because they also want a cut of his bonking profits. Peter told Daily Sun he was at loggerheads with cops from Dawn Park Police Station, close to Vosloorus.He claimed police officers visited him and threatened to take his keys and throw them away if he didn&rsquo;t share with them.He said he tried to report the corrupt cops at the police station but that he wasn&rsquo;t winning the battle.&ldquo;They&rsquo;re greedy. They already earn salaries and I&rsquo;m not making a lot of money. &ldquo;These magoshas use my house and pay me per customer. Magoshas are the ones making money, not me,&rdquo; he said.Peter, from Boksburg, Ekurhuleni said after the cops came to his house to demand the keys, he decided to spend time away from his house.&ldquo;The magoshas have their own set of keys. I know for sure they won&rsquo;t give them to the cops.&rdquo;The magoshas told Daily Sun the cops were just jealous. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy for the cops to rob us and our customers when we&rsquo;re busy in the house. &ldquo;They target us when we go to the bush because there they can confiscate car keys to extort money from our clients,&rdquo; said a magosha.Daily Sun found Peter at another house in the area where he said he was hiding. &ldquo;Police keep harassing me,&rdquo; he said. Sergeant Mashudu Phathela, a police spokesman, said they were not aware that police were harassing magoshas and promised to investigate.
