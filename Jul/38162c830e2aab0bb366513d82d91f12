Sbahle Mpisane&nbsp;Can we take a moment of silence. . . That body. . . okay. Let me speak about her bikini. Mesh and Sport Luxe are huge trends right now. This suits Sbahle because she is all about fitness so wearing this fits well with her brand/image.&nbsp;2. Amanda Du-Pont&nbsp; Thigh high boots are a huge trend this year. Amanda pairs them with an over sized long sleeve top which is perfect. She looks so dope.&nbsp; 3. Boity Thulo&nbsp; As mentioned before sport luxe is big right now. In gym wear, High waist tights and crop tops are on trend and look so cute. Gone are the days were workout clothes are boring and bland.&nbsp; 4. Kefilwe Mabote Kefilwe looks so classy in her jumpsuit, over sized sunglasses and cute handbag. We have been seeing jumpsuits a lot lately. They are great for wanting to look stylish but not trying too hard.&nbsp; 5. Babes Wodumo I am loving the full costume. Babes looks really cute in this blue number. I also really like her red hair and how it matches the cute red detail on her swimsuit.&nbsp;
