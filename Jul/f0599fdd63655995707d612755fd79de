FURIOUS protesters tried to attack an old age home and damaged traffic lights, cars and mobile feeding kitchens yesterday. The residents of Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay, Cape Town, were protesting for a third day in a row and barricaded every entrance to the area with stones and trees. They prevented residents from going to work and cars seen driving around were stoned. About 1 000 residents gathered in front of the local cop shop and sang before smashing the windows of an old age home. They also threw mobile toilets on the road.
