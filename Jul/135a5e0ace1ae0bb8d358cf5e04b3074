Kaizer Chiefs began their 2017/18 preseason training programme this morning with two new faces among the squad; Philani Zulu who joins from Maritzburg United and Zimbabwean International, Teenage Hadebe from Chicken Inn F.C.&nbsp;The team returned last Thursday to undergo medicals and started full training this morning under the guidance of coach Steve Komphela and his new assistant Patrick Mabedi.&nbsp;Philani Zulu is 28 years old and plays as a left wing back, while Hadebe is 21 and is a centre back and recently played in the much acclaimed Zimbabwean senior national team. Both players signed for an initial three years with the option to extend their stay with Amakhosi.&ldquo;We have been working throughout the break to negotiate and finalise some of these deals,&rdquo; said Amakhosi&rsquo;s Football Manager, Bobby Motaung. &ldquo;We need to make sure that coach Steve and his new assistant have a strong team that will compete fiercely in the new season.&rdquo;Komphela has worked with Zulu in the past and the player came highly recommended because of his skill and versatility. Hadebe trained with Kaizer Chiefs during last year&rsquo;s preseason but the club could not secure his signature at the time.&nbsp;&ldquo;We welcome the duo to our stable and hope that they live up to expectations and make our supporters happy,&rdquo; added Motaung. &ldquo;We have been monitoring them and we really felt they could help improve our squad.&rdquo;Kaizer Chiefs will make further announcements regarding player signings and promotions in due course.&nbsp;
