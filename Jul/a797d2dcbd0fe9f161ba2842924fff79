MARRIAGE is important in the eyes of God and to society at large. The 7 Mountains of God Ministries runs two marriage seminars each year.Last Friday, the church hosted the first annual seminar in Middelburg, Mpumalanga.Senior Pastor of the 7 Mountains of God Ministries, Orlando Msimang, told Sunday Sun: We had a successful and powerful marriage seminar that was attended by married couples. We know being married is a blessing to God. And living a peaceful life in marriages makes God happy. And that causes God to continue blessing the couples and their children. Peace and love in the couple s marriage is the order of the day, said Pastor Msimang.The pastor added that the seminar talked mainly about communication and intimacy in the marriage. We agreed that every married couple should communicate to solidify their relationship despite challenges that may occur in the marriage, he said.The pastor said commitment in marriage should be 100% and one should give one s soul, body, money and commitment to one s partner.He said in whatever situation wives should be loved by their husbands and wives should respect their husbands.The Book of Genesis reads: The Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. These scriptures were read and spoken about throughout the seminar as married couples, pastors and apostles listened attentively.Pastor Msimang said he wished married couples who attended the seminar would grow when the church hosted its second annual seminar in a venue to be named later.
