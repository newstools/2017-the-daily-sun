He said he would also shoot himself in front of everyone if we did not tell him where the manager was,” said an employee.The man held them hostage for about three hours.Vanderbijlpark police Sergeant Gertrude Makhale confirmed to Daily Sun that a hostage drama had indeed taken place. A police hostage negotiator was called to the scene.“There were about 50 hostages – but after the negotiator spoke to him he released a lot of them. He kept two with him,” said Makhale.After a while the 30-year-old suspect also released the remaining two hostages and surrendered his weapon.The man was arrested and charged with malicious damage to property, intimidation and discharging a firearm.“No one was injured and the man will appear in court soon,” said Makhale.Emfuleni municipal spokesman Stanley Gaba confirmed the hostage drama but refused to comment further as doing so “might jeopardise the police investigation”.
