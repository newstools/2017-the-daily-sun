THE University of KwaZulu-Natal understands that leaders are made, not born.That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve invited 200 grade 11 pupils from disadvantaged schools in KZN and Gauteng to attend the 16th annual Masakhane Youth Leadership course.The course started on Sunday and will end tomorrow. Professor Thabo Msibi, the dean and head of the School of Education, said he is pleased with the high attendance and the participation of pupils in the course.&ldquo;We thought we would have about 200 pupils but we ended up with 250. The energy the pupils have shown is amazing. They&rsquo;re driven, they ask questions and they engage well in all discussion,&rdquo; said Msibi.The pupils have been exposed to teaching from some of the university&rsquo;s best academics.Some of the topics discussed in the lectures are gender and leadership, violence in schools, and managing and embracing diversity and business.Msibi said they&rsquo;re proud to see how much impact the course has had since it started in 2002. He said they approached mostly disadvantaged schools to join the course.&ldquo;We also invited a few pupils from advantaged schools so that pupils could share their ideas.&rdquo; Nduduzo Nyoka (17) from Tugela Secondary School in Gingindlovu, northern KZN, said the course has brought much needed inspiration. &ldquo;Such opportunities are very scarce in rural areas like mine. This programme made me realise that if one is introduced to the right channels, one can be successful,&rdquo; said Nduduzo.
