THE South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) will be in court this morning arguing for an interdict against Black First, Land First (BLF).Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Gallens, filed the application on Tuesday.The group has asked the court to interdict Andile Mngxitama and BLF from harassing, intimidating, assaulting and threatening journalists and editors over their reporting on corruption and state capture.''The reason for the harassment is because they have carried on their work independently as journalists," Gallens's founding affidavit said.Last week Thursday, Business Day editor Tim Cohen was assaulted as he tried to take a picture of BLF supporters gathered outside Tiso Blackstar editor-at-large Peter Bruce's home in Johannesburg.Bruce was targeted the week before in a series of articles and secretly taken photographs relating to his private life, indicating that he had been spied on.He wrote a column in Business Day about the surveillance and mentioned Mngxitama as a ''luckless land reformer'' who had tweeted to him: "you going to get a heart attack Peter; better prepare yourself."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/sanef-heads-to-court-for-urgent-interdict-against-blf-20170706
