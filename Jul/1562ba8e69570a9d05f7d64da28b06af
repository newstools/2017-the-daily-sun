to be old enough to look after herself.This is where the terrifying story began.She contacted her trusted friend 
who was studying in Joburg and she promised her a job.Soon after that she boarded a train to
the city of gold, Joburg. Her journey was filled with hopes and dreams but it all came crashing down.The friend she trusted betrayed her and sold her to a human
trafficking syndicate.In the video below she explains how she reached the final straw in
her life of slavery and refused to service a client for the human traffickers.Grizelda has since published a book about her life story, titled: EXIT!It's the story of her life of prostitution and her ultimate escape
from it all.She currently works as an activist against human trafficking at
Embrace Dignity, an NPO based in Cape Town.  She supports fellow survivors
undergoing rehabilitation. The organisation is part of a growing global movement working to
restore dignity for all and public education to address commercial sexual
exploitation and human trafficking.
