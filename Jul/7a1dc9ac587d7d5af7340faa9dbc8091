STRUGGLING to find work inspired Mninawa Nondlwane (45) from Nomzamo, Strand to start his business.The father of two used to look for work in the week and sell pork on weekends. But he found that it soon ran out.&ldquo;I decided to start selling it full-time,&rdquo; said Mninawa.His stand is at one of Nomzamo&rsquo;s busiest crossroads, where taxi drivers and people who go to work pass by.Asked if he&rsquo;d accept a job offer, Mninawa said he&rsquo;ll never go for it now.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is a job that would pay me R900 on good days and R700 on a bad day,&rdquo; said the proud dad.He uses mixed spices and salt to flavour his pork.&ldquo;Ever since I started, there has never been a day that I&rsquo;ve gone to bed without the meat being sold out. &ldquo;People even knock on my window while I am sleeping to buy some.&rdquo; His challenge is transport. &ldquo;Places that sell meat at affordable prices are very far away. I am forced to buy close by because I do not have my own transport.&rdquo; But at the rate his meat is selling, he might be able to buy a car very soon.Mninawa also said drunk customers give him a hard time by wanting to touch the meat with their hands.&ldquo;I try to stay calm and provide them with a fork. They are my customers.&rdquo; Thembelani Roro (36) said Mninawa&rsquo;s meat is very tasty. &ldquo;I want my wife to go to him for lessons because he prepares the meat very well. It is a must for me to always get a piece after work.&rdquo;Mninawa said people who would like to sell meat can come to him and he will give them his suppliers&rsquo; contacts. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say this business is mine only and be stingy. People can come and ask me anything and I will gladly assist them to start their own businesses.&rdquo;
