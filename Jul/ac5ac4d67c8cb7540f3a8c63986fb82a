BAFANA Bafana head coach Stuart Baxter says while he is disappointed by the 1-0 loss to Tanzania in the quarterfinals of the 2017 COSAFA Castle Cup, it was a much-needed exercise to get some information on his players.Following a Tanzania goal early in the first half, South Africa could not recover from the setback and eventually surrendered the title they won in 2016.&ldquo;Results are very important, you never give away a result, you always want to win. I am really disappointed in the result &nbsp;but more disappointed that no one really raised their hand. I think the only player to do so was Riyaad Norodien, I think he did well,&rdquo; said Baxter.&ldquo;Every defeat is a setback, this is a disappointing result but if you see the bigger picture you have to look at it and say is this a devastating blow or disappointing evening, I would say it was a disappointing evening because you always play to win.&rdquo;Bafana Bafana will now face Botswana in the plate-play-off match scheduled for the Moruleng Stadium on Tuesday, 4 July 2017.Kickoff is at 17h00.For the Tanzania clash, Baxter picked eight uncapped players in the starting line-up, and added a further two in the game.He expects to make some challenges for the Botswana encounter.&ldquo;Since we can&rsquo;t win the tournament we will have to go all out for development. With due respect to the organisers, there&rsquo;s nothing to be won."The biggest thing we can take from the remaining games, is that we give a couple of youngsters a chance, so we will rotate the squad fiercely,&rdquo; added the Bafana Bafana mentor. Baxter says a lot of composure is also needed as they assess the process.&ldquo;Again, looking at games like these, you have to keep a little bit of discipline and composure, and not in your disappointment rush out and say let&rsquo;s bring back Shabba, push in Yeye, or get those players that are in South Africa but will not give us anything in a long term,&rdquo; said Baxter.&ldquo;So you have to keep your composure, you have to make sure that you don&rsquo;t think that you have lost &ndash; you have to see it as having won or learnt, hopefully we will learn something from this loss. It&rsquo;s very disappointing, and there&rsquo;s no one more disappointed than me, but it&rsquo;s up to everybody to get some perspective on this &ndash; we have to look at it and ask ourselves, &lsquo;which of the youngsters could handle it? And that has to be the same with the upcoming CHAN qualifiers.&rdquo;Bafana Bafana will have a light training session this afternoon (Monday, 3 July 2017) to prepare for the Botswana clash.
