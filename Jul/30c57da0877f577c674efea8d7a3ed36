We have consulted with the authorities and we should have an answer in no time,&rdquo; said Baxter.BAFANA BAFANA SQUAD FOR CHANBoalefa Pule (SuperSport)&sbquo; Khulekani Kubheka (Sundowns)&sbquo; Stephen Hoffman (Platinum Stars)&sbquo; Siyabonga Nhlapo (Wits)&sbquo; Sphiwe Mnguni (Platinum Stars)&sbquo; Malebogo Modise (Sundowns)&sbquo; Tercius Malepe (Pirates)&sbquo; Junaid Sait (Stellenbosch FC)&sbquo; Sandile Mthethwa (Pirates)&sbquo; Mothobi Mvala (Highlands Park)&sbquo; Teboho Mokoena (SuperSport)&sbquo; Sipho Mbule (SuperSport)&sbquo; Cole Alexander (SuperSport)&sbquo; Lehlohonolo Masalesa (unattached)&sbquo; Sphelele Ntshangase (Leopards)&sbquo; Jamie Webber (Stellenbisch FC&sbquo; Riyaad Norodien (Pirates)&sbquo; Gift Motupa (Baroka)&sbquo; Bonginkosi Ntuli (Sundowns)&sbquo; Ryan Moon (Chiefs).
