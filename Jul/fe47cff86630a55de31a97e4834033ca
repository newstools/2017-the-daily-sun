The South African matric certificate still has some value overseas, Netwerk24 has reported. Reece Kannemeyer, who matriculated at the Harold Cressy High School in the Western Cape last year, was shattered when the Teesside University in the UK turned down his application to do a BA history degree. The university explained in a letter that he didn&rsquo;t have the necessary qualifications. "When I inquired, the university said it was because the grading on my certificate isn&rsquo;t equivalent to qualifications in Britain," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Stephanie Berry, the director of BritEd, an agency that helps South Africans study in the UK, says cases such as this are the exception."Most varsities, except elite institutions such as Oxford, accept the National Senior Certificate."A South African matric is even accepted at some British medical schools."The only problem is that the South African curriculum covers less chemistry than the British school curriculum, but South African pupils have overcome this obstacle in the past," she says.She also points out that British universities only considered the marks of six subjects, because life orientation isn&rsquo;t considered a subject.http://www.parent24.com/Learn/Tertiary-education/sa-matric-is-still-valuable-overseas-20170703
