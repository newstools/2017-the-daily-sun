MAKHOSANDILE Mzimela (10) left his home in KwaDlangezwa on Saturday to visit his aunt at the nearby village of Ntuze, near Empangeni. But he never made it and hasn&rsquo;t been seen since.The shocked family from northern KZN has looked everywhere for him and even went to report the matter to the cops.They allege they were told by the police to wait until schools reopened in about three weeks&rsquo; time to see if he didn&rsquo;t show up.However, the family&rsquo;s biggest fear is that history might repeat itself. Last March, Makhosandile&rsquo;s father disappeared in the same manner. His decomposing body was later found in the bush in the village.His aunt, Nozipho Mthethwa (36), said: &ldquo;I received a call from my father, Dodeni Mthethwa (70), who&rsquo;s his guardian, checking to see if Makhosandile had travelled safely. I was surprised because he hadn&rsquo;t arrived at my house. We&rsquo;re stressed because we don&rsquo;t know where he is. We don&rsquo;t even know if he&rsquo;s still alive or not.&rdquo; Nozipho said if something happened to Makhosandile it would kill her father. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s devastated as he has taking care of him, since both his parents are dead. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t stopped blaming himself for allowing him to come to my place by himself. We pray we find him alive.&rdquo; Captain Nqobile Gwala, KZN police spokeswoman, said she followed up on the family&rsquo;s allegations about the cops.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still waiting for a full report. In the meantime, a missing person&rsquo;s case has been opened at Mtunzini cop shop and police are investigating,&rdquo; she said.
