CABLE thieves have stepped on the toes of residents again.After five days without electricity, angry residents of Lawley, south of Joburg brought their area to a standstill yesterday. Nobody was allowed in or out of the area. The main road was blocked with burning tyres and rocks.Resident Rose Sithole (49) said her son&rsquo;s life depended on an oxygen machine.&ldquo;My nine-year-old son uses an electric oxygen machine but when there is no power, we have an oxygen cylinder for back-up. &ldquo;What I fear the most is running out of oxygen for my son.&rdquo;&ldquo;I just want the electricity issue to be fixed.&rdquo;Sanele Mbatha of the South African National Civic Organisation in the area said the lack of electricity was even affecting schools.&ldquo;Some schools never finished their exams and the kids haven&rsquo;t received their reports.&rdquo; He said cables were being stolen almost every week.According to Mbatha, the former member of the mayoral committee for infrastructure promised to replaced the copper cable with aluminium, but nothing has been done.Councillor Margaret Mcbason said the theft has been happening for more than three months.&ldquo;Since the substation caught fire, we have had problems. &ldquo;They promised us they will upgrade the substation, but that hasn&rsquo;t happened.&rdquo;Residents marched to City Power in Lenasia and handed over a memorandum of grievances.
