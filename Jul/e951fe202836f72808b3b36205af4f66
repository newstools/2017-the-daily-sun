SHE’s Mzansi’s own showbiz fantasy come true. Queen B is always associated with all things glitz and glam . . . BUT HER RUMOURED R150 000-PLUS BILL HAS LED TO HER VIP-STATUS BEING REVOKED!if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>This after radio and TV A-lister, Bonang Matheba, launched a scathing attack aimed at Vodacom on social media, following her return from anall-expenses-paid Durban July trip by the telecoms giant.According to insiders, the star often went off at the company to get its attention.Said the first source: “But now they’ve had enough. After the latest attack on the company, Vodacom decided to downgrade her from its VIP list to being a mere prepaid subscriber.“As a VIP subscriber, her number had premium benefits, which are way different from those of ordinary citizens. But the company feels enough is enough.”A second source said Queen B’s social media rant was prompted by her beef with the telecoms behemoth over the massive cellphone bill, which led to her being downgraded in its network.“She wanted Vodacom to override the bill, which had gone well above R150K. She accumulated this amount on data and call charges in only one month,” the source said.“As for the social media attack, it’s not her first. When it started, Vodacom met her halfway by writing her bill of more than R50K off. The same thing happened, and a bill of more than R100K was written off.“The bottom line is that Vodacom may have written off her bills to the tune of more than R250K.” A third source said: “Not only has she run up a huge bill, but Vodacom pays her a pretty penny for certain promotional work.”This week, Vodacom spokesperson Byron Kennedy confirmed our enquiry.In an email he said: “At Bonang’s request we have transferred her number to prepaid, and have cancelled her contract. The Protection of Personal Information Act restricts us from commenting further on this matter.”Queen B refused to comment on the issue and hung up the phone.
