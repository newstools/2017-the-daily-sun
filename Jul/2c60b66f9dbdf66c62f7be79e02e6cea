In Mzansi and around the world, the name Nelson Mandela is synonymous with democracy, political activism and boxing.This is because the late Mzansi President Nelson Mandela is known around the world as a freedom fighter and South Africa&rsquo;s first black president &ndash; and the best statesman ever since 1992.And whoever is named after him, is expected to at least be part of politics.BUT there's another Nelson Mandela - soon to be famous and he is not anywhere near the political sphere.The 18-year-old Nelson Mandela Mbouhom is a soccer player from Cameroon and has been offered a professional contract by Eintracht Frankfurt FC, which campaigns in Germany's Bundesliga.Bundesliga's official Website reported that Eintracht Frankfurt have handed young Cameroon striker Nelson Mandela a two-year professional contract.The 18-year-old, who joined Frankfurt's Under-15s from Barcelona in 2013, has since progressed through the Eagles' Under-17 and Under-19 ranks to the professional squad."I'm very happy to get this opportunity," said Mandela. "I feel really comfortable at Frankfurt and want to help this fantastic team. Being able to take part in the full pre-season makes me really proud.""Nelson is a great lad who's put plenty of smiles on faces in the youth teams," said Bruno H&uuml;bner, Frankfurt's sporting director. "We're really pleased he'll be taking the next step in his career with us &ndash; he's got unbelievable potential."Now Madiba&rsquo;s name is no longer about political activism or only associated with South Africa, but any African reserves rights to the powerful name.
