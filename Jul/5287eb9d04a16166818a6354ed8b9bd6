were made, Captain Kay Makhubele said.Johannesburg Metro Police spokesperson Edna Mamonyane said
the protest caused major delays from Rea Vaya bus services in Soweto.On Twitter, the Rea Vaya account said services were
operating normally, but commuters should expect delays.Mamonyane said authorities would try to ensure relevant
people met with protesters to address their concerns.Protesters are complaining about prepaid electricity meter
boxes, and an apparent 6 000 litre water allowance which is being revoked.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/rubber-bullets-fired-in-soweto-protest-20170704
