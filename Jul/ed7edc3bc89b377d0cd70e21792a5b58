TUMELO takes care of the spiritual side of things as a good sangoma should, but he also takes care of his body.While most sangomas throw bones to help others, Tumelo &ldquo;Hlalabamzonda&rdquo; Leeto (26) exercises to keep his own bones fit and strong.Daily Sun spotted Hlalabamzonda next to the road, doing his regular exercise routine to stay healthy. Tumelo, originally from Coligny, North West lives in the Uptown Section of Bekkersdal, west of Joburg.&ldquo;My ancestors used to walk long distances in the villages and they looked strong and lived long.&ldquo;I sometimes have dreams of playing tennis with them.&rdquo;He said when he speaks to his ancestors in a private corner where he burns imphepho, a strong urge to exercise comes over him. &ldquo;I drink muthi for different reasons but morning exercise is key to staying cool and calm. It doesn&rsquo;t require a special place like a hall. I just do it next to the road.&rdquo;He said morning walks and breathing a lot of oxygen keeps him alert and helps to develop his self-confidence and mental stability. Tumelo said he sometimes heals people who are physically strong who have been cursed by evil spirits.&ldquo;That requires me to have balance, strength and strong shoulders and arms.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any physical problems. I don&rsquo;t smoke or drink. I used to weigh 75kg but now I&rsquo;m down to 67kg and I feel strong.&rdquo;
