Fifteen adult nappies cost a whopping R289. I also have to buy her Nespray instant milk and vegetables because she only eats soft foods. “Paying for transport to take her for checkups takes up most of the money.” She also has to have money ready to pay for a car to take her daughter to hospital if things go wrong at night.“When I use taxis I have to pay for two extra seats for the wheelchair.”Zodwa has dedicated her whole life to her child. She is a stay-at-home mum because people don’t have the patience to look after Khanyisile. “I would appreciate help with anything from nappies to formula and transport.”She said she applied for an RDP in 1996  but is still on the waiting list.
