LEGENDARY musician and producer, Robbie Malinga, has joined the long list of celebrities who have been scammed.&nbsp; Robbie&rsquo;s phone was hacked on Wednesday night.&nbsp; And now the star is warning people who might have received SMSes asking for money, not to send it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to tell those who will receive SMSes or communications requesting money from me not to give them.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are people who hacked my phones and are pretending to be me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Robbie says the hackers have been asking money from his contacts, claiming to be in need of financial assistance.&nbsp; The veteran singer said when he woke up, he noticed his phone&rsquo;s light was on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was alerted by my wife when she asked me why was I sending her an SMS while I was with her,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Robbie said when he checked his phone, there was no network.&nbsp; &ldquo;Later on, my manager called me to say he&rsquo;d heard that I&rsquo;d been arrested and needed money for bail. I told him I was fine and didn&rsquo;t need money,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Robbie told Sunday Sun he suspected that the people who had hacked his phone had sent such messages to all his contacts.&nbsp; &ldquo;Phiwe gave them R3&thinsp;500,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Robbie said several people were calling him to check if he was fine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard that even some of my friends and colleagues in the industry did send the money to these guys,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Robbie said after receiving several phone calls, he then went to the network provider to do a sim swap.&nbsp; &ldquo;They gave me the number and said everything was fine. The network provider promised this wouldn&rsquo;t happen again. But to my surprise, the hackers continued to use my number on Thursday evening,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; He said even at the Vodacom Durban July, people had been asking him if he&rsquo;s fine.&nbsp; When the SunTeam contacted Phiwe, he refused to comment on the matter.&nbsp;
