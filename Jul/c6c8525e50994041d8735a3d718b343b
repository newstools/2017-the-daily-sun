AJAX CAPE TOWN new recruit Sedwyn George is determined to continue where he left off in the National First Division (NFD) when the Absa Premiership starts next month.&nbsp;The Pietermaritzburg-born striker joined the Urban Warriors last month on a two-year deal from NFD side, Royal Eagles, where he made a name for himself.&nbsp;Last season in the NFD, the deadly striker netted 20 goals for his side and won the prestigious Golden Boot Award.&nbsp;His consistent performance also attracted interest of many PSL clubs.&nbsp;But George thought joining Ajax would be a stepping stone toward achieving his long-term goal of playing overseas.&nbsp;Said George: &ldquo;Ajax came with a good offer and, with the hard work I&rsquo;ll be putting in, I&rsquo;ll get enough game time and won&rsquo;t be a bench-warmer there.&rdquo;&nbsp;Despite being a top goal scorer in the NFD, there&rsquo;s still a lot that George wants to learn and improve on as a player.&nbsp;&ldquo;The are still some areas of concern, I&rsquo;m not at my level best yet,&rdquo; George said.&nbsp;&ldquo;But I believe I can improve and grow as a player here at my new home of Ajax.&rdquo;&nbsp;In his 20 goals, George had netted three hat-tricks, something rare in the NFD.&nbsp;It is believed the 25-year-old will be replacing veteran Nathan Paulse, whose contracts has not been renewed at Ajax.&nbsp;But George did not agree with the idea, saying it would put him under unnecessary pressure.&nbsp;He said: &ldquo;I have already started working hard with the team, I want to make my mark in the PSL.&nbsp;&ldquo;But at this stage, I don&rsquo;t want to put unnecessary pressure on myself by saying I will do this and that.&nbsp;&ldquo;To be honest, I just want to be better than what I was in the NFD. I&rsquo;m not here to fill anyone&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
