IT&rsquo;S allegedly not business as usual for power couple Rosette and Lunga Ncwana.&nbsp;According to insiders, the top model and businessman&rsquo;s once dreamy marriage has been downgraded to junk status.&nbsp;And the slowing romance economy between the lovers is allegedly due to Lunga&rsquo;s underhanded dealings with his rumoured side dish, Rethabile Lethoko, sources say.&nbsp;&ldquo;Lunga&rsquo;s always with Rethabile whenever he&rsquo;s in Joburg,&rdquo; the first source claimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on great terms with his side dish, but things are shaky between Rosette and him. At some point, things were so bad between them, that they were even sleeping in different rooms at their Cape Town home.&rdquo;&nbsp;The source said Rosette had even reverted back to her maiden name of Mogomotsi on social media.&nbsp;According to a second insider, Rethabile had moved into the couple&rsquo;s Melrose home in Jozi. This as Lunga had allegedly told his mistress that he wanted to upgrade her status to being his umakoti.&nbsp;Said the mole: &ldquo;He apparently told her that he had problems at home and saw no other way but out of his marriage. This is why he wanted them to take things to the next level.&rdquo;&nbsp;A third mole claimed: &ldquo;Rosette&rsquo;s known about the affair for some time. Heck, she&rsquo;s even seen some of the text messages they&rsquo;ve sent to each other on her man&rsquo;s phone. The problem is she&rsquo;d never had the chance to confront Rethabile about the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp;A fourth source claimed umakoti and the side dish almost got into an altercation a few weeks ago, when the two happened to be working at the same shoot .&nbsp;&ldquo;Rosette had rifled through Rethabile&rsquo;s handbag while she was shooting and found the keys to her Melrose house. All hell broke loose,&rdquo; the source said.&nbsp;&ldquo;And things would&rsquo;ve gotten ugly were it not for the crew, which stepped in just in time. Poor Rethabile had to leave the set embarrassed after that near mishap.&rdquo;&nbsp;The source claimed Lunga went all out to console his squeeze when he found out about the incident. He allegedly bought her dozens of roses and an expensive gift, while his wife &ldquo;got nada&rdquo;.&nbsp;According to the source, the affair has been going on for two years.&nbsp;When contacted, Rosette said: &ldquo;I have nothing to comment.&rdquo;&nbsp;Lunga and Rethabile could not be reached for comment, as their phones rang unanswered.
