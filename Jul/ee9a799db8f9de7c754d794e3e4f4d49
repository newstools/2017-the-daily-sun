MZANSI hip hop star Cassper Nyovest does it against all odds.&nbsp; It is alleged that the Tito Mboweni hitmaker has set his aim on filling up FNB Stadium later this year.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s another claim that international hip hop sensation P Diddy is set to meet Cassper.&nbsp; Apparently, P Diddy has heard a lot about Cassper (real name Refiloe Phoolo) and his successful record of filling huge arenas with happy audiences.&nbsp; When Sunday Sun spoke to Cassper, he neither denied nor confirmed the first allegation.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still at the first phase of this year&rsquo;s edition of Fill Up. FNB is possible. But I don&rsquo;t want to say much right now because I&rsquo;m still on tour promoting my album.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say Fill Up FNB can&rsquo;t happen. But as far as the P Diddy allegation is concerned, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; said Cassper.&nbsp; But sources close to his record label, Family Tree, suggest Cassper is innovative when it comes to giving himself to and meeting his fans.&nbsp; One music world insider said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a lot when it comes to boosting his brand and increasing his fanbase.&nbsp; &ldquo;Late last year, Cassper was looking for new ideas to further push his career. He will come up with something.&rdquo;&nbsp; A second mole told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;When it comes to filling up arenas, Cassper&rsquo;s been getting requests from various countries on the continent. And let&rsquo;s not forget that last month he filled up the Wembley Arena in London. With him, anything is possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;
