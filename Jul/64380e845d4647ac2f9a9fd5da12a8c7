But they created a role for my personality.&ldquo;Tsakane, as a character, is passionately involved in student politics.&rdquo;The bubbly actress said she enjoyed working with seasoned actors as she got to learn a lot from them.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m falling in love with my character every day. I get to learn from my co-actors as I didn&rsquo;t go to acting school. I&rsquo;m learning to be natural in front of the camera.&ldquo;They allow me to bring my own style to the role, like the T-shirts Tsakane wears.&rdquo;Maya strikes a balance between performing on stage and being on set on time.&ldquo;It was a struggle at first, but now I juggle being a rapper with acting.&rdquo;When she is not on our small screens, Maya the rapper is out there promoting her single, Dumi Hi Phone.Catch Maya as she plays student activist Tsakane in Isithembiso on Mzansi Magic (DStv channel 161) weekdays at 7.30pm .&nbsp;
