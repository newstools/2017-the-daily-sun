Amstel Maboa said he is shattered by the death of his friend and colleague. “She was the best at what she did and I learnt a lot from her.“I knew she was sick but thought she would win the battle against cancer. It is hard to accept.” He said they won many awards together. “She was very professional and loved her job. She touched many local and international faces, too many to mention.” Media personality Kuli Roberts said she was shattered by the news. “Iko used to dress me and made me look beautiful. I will always cherish the moments I had with her.” She said Iko’s death should be a lesson for people to talk about challenges facing people and the industry. Iko also was a mentor and judge for Sunday Sun’s SunBabes and will be sorely missed. The family did not want to speak to the media.I was with her mum and we were holding her in our arms when she took her last breath.
