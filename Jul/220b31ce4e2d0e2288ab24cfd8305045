SOCIAL media has opened many channels for communication among people worldwide. But could it pose a threat to your love life? I seen your girl post her BM, So I hit her in the DM, all Eyes, yeah I see &lsquo;em, Yeah, that&rsquo;s your man, I&rsquo;d hate to be him. It goes down in the DM . . .&nbsp; Those lyrics are from Yo Gotti&rsquo;s 2015 hit single, Down in the DM.&nbsp; The music video tells the story of a man who&rsquo;s about to be married, but can&rsquo;t seem to stop&nbsp;swapping sexual texts with another woman on DM, instagram&rsquo;s direct messages. The song illustrates the new age mode of cheating which puts high value on sexual gratification. Psychologist, Narusha Naidoo, said: &ldquo;Many people cheat online to escape into a fantasy world where their usual relationship problems don&rsquo;t exist. &ldquo;People often think their online affairs aren&rsquo;t real, unlike a traditional affair where there&rsquo;s usually physical contact.&rdquo; According to News24, about 64% people cheat online. Sakheni Mvela was one of them. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was a big deal. We never met,&rdquo; he said. But Sakheni slammed his laptop shut during a sexy chat when he heard his fiancee&rsquo;s footsteps. He has since deactivated his social media accounts, for fear they would harm his relationship.
