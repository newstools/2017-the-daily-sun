THE future of SA U-23 coach Owen da Gama is still hanging in the balance.Da Gama was appointed to the post by former coach, Ephraim Shakes Mashaba, who has parted ways with the national association.&nbsp;Newly appointed coach, Stuart Baxter, is busy finalising his new technical team, and has made it clear Da Gama will not be a part of his bench, going forward.&nbsp;This has left the South African Football Association (Safa) to weigh these two options: of either terminating Da Gama&rsquo;s contract, or finding some work for him within the association.The current situation is that the U-23 coach automatically becomes the assistant to the Bafana Bafana trainer. But Da Gama has been in limbo since Baxter took over in the two matches against Nigeria and Zambia.Safa CEO Dennis Mumble said: &ldquo;I will have my discussion with Owen. I&rsquo;m meeting him tomorrow.&ldquo;Baxter is going to give me feedback on his assessment regarding his technical support that we&rsquo;ve given him in the last couple of matches.&nbsp;&ldquo;And for Cosafa, he will give me his views about his final technical team.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about Owen before I talk to Owen himself. That&rsquo;s what tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting is all about.&nbsp;&ldquo;Like all the other assistant coaches of the national teams, their contracts are tied to the head coach&rsquo;s contract and they understand that if a new head coach chooses a different support team, then those contracts will cease immediately.&rdquo;About finding another post for Da Gama within Safa, Mumble said he would have discussions with his office.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have discussions with Safa about what we could do with Owen within Safa. If we find something else for him to do, I won&rsquo;t have the dialogue in the media until I talk to him directly first,&rdquo; Mumble added.&nbsp;Da Gama has previously coached Premier Soccer Leagues clubs such as Platinum Stars, Orlando Pirates, Free State Stars and Bloemfontein Celtic with commendable success.&nbsp; Coach&rsquo;s career in limbo
