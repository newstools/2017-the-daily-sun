Four men armed with AK-47s and travelling in a silver Audi tried to ambush the Fidelity truck on Modderfontein Road, Ekurhuleni. Police spokeswoman Constable Sharon Tsotsotso told Daily Sun: “Police are searching for the suspects responsible for the attempted heist during which the truck was bombed three times and shot at several times.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstqRgoZ52K_p4rcJeaJ6FgzEHrS_d609S6x6bIV3s4wpJZFug3xULVWnSbmIsYbQ_Q1ta03TAPhk6sEtjG-P74nSWhV9cmUqWTXE2D5yNAA4uw-jCk-mj8dzWTeCs5paXb1ZuXdJuYo9i8_aPMLc_O5_gwoWtQFtS_IqWXuFwtXSqKHRntiU9AuG_enFhy4Y4ImpAlLOky-jBx4vjsCUcgYAhNc_AFJpQJsiVkq0nwN_6fN2v6h_Nj9j6fV5XLrUO61op3BP2aoH-eV-9XaRD3Egu1YTTw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzFL72_4ZnQucEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

The van came to a standstill on the P91 at the Tembisa/Zuurfontein turn-off.” The thugs bombed the truck three times but they were not able to break into it and eventually they fled from the scene empty-handed. The guards were not harmed. “If anyone has information that may help the police to find the suspects, please call the detective branch on 011 400 6000,” said Tsotsotso.
