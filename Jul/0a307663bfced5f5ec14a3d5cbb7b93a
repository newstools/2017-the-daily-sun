UGANDAN public servants have been told that clothing that flashes their bits or fashionable accessories like braids and long nails will no longer be welcome at work.According to the Daily Monitor, the Ministry of Public Service sent all government offices instructions that women &ldquo;should avoid wearing sleeves, transparent blouses and dresses at the work place [and] ensure that clothing covers up cleavage, navels, knees and back. Female officers will not be allowed to appear for duty in open flat shoes except on a doctor&rsquo;s recommendation/medical grounds, wear bright coloured hair, in form of natural hair, braids and hair extensions.Women will be allowed to wear trousers, but only if in the &ldquo;form of smart lady suits with jackets, long enough to cover the bosom&rdquo;.Male public servants are instructed to be equally unadorned, reportedly being told that their new dress code is a suit and tie &ndash; and no open shoes allowed.The ministry&rsquo;s director Adah Muwanga was quoted as saying: &ldquo;We got complaints that some public officers are indecent. Some female officers are pumping up their breasts, wearing mini-skirts&hellip; You are sexually harassing the male counterparts and in Uganda this is not acceptable.&ldquo;We are mindful of the perception of the public to our officers. Do you feel okay when you have nails several meters long? It is not neat and healthy and we have to care about the health of public officers,&rdquo; she added.
