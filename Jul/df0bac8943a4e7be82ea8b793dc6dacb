A HUGE, water-filled hole in the street is striking fear into the hearts of kasi parents. They say their kids stand above the hole and stare at their own reflections in the water and they&rsquo;re scared they will fall in and drown. Residents of Peace Village in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage, told Daily Sun the three-and-a-half metre deep hole was dug almost a month ago and they needed the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality to seal it. The hole was left by municipal workers after they fixed a drain last month. The repairs were made after Daily Sun published a story about the problem. Resident Nomathamsanqa Lama (50), who lives with three boys aged between seven and 13, said the hole on Siwane Street was big enough to swallow two cows.&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get into my own yard because the hole is at the entrance. When we go outside, we have to climb over the fence into my neighbour&rsquo;s yard,&rdquo; she said. She said kasi kids recently lost a ball after it fell into the hole and they wanted to climb in to fetch it but they stopped them in time. She said: &ldquo;My husband Dladla (53) has even stopped boozing because of it. He is afraid of falling into the hole.&rdquo; Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still working at the site. &ldquo;However, a team will be sent to make it safer.&rdquo;
