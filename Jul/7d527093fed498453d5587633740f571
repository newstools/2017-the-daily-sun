DESPITE the continued speculation surrounding his future, Orlando Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret is not losing any sleep about the possibility of being sacked this week. The Swedish born mentor runs the risk of being replaced with Mulitin &ldquo;Micho&rdquo; Sredojevic, who is rumoured to be in South Africa after resigning from his job as coach of Uganda&rsquo;s Cranes. But Jonevret is as cool as a cucumber. Even after his team had lost the pre-season Carling Black Label Champion Cup 1-0 to arch-rivals Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium following a Bernard Parker goal, Jonevret still predicted a good season ahead for the Buccaneers. He was encouraged by the way his team performed. Said Jonevret: &ldquo;Well, when I arrived here my mission was to try and save the season. For a while there we were involved in a relegation battle. We got the points that were needed to finish in a safe position. &ldquo;We also worked hard to get to the Nedbank Cup final. I have been in this business for long and know what it&rsquo;s all about. &ldquo;Sometimes club bosses have patience and sometimes they don&rsquo;t, and at Pirates there has been a lot of coaches in the last couple of years. &ldquo;I remain professional, work hard every day and always try to do my best.&rdquo; But Jonevret, who joined the Buccaneers in February towards the end of the 2016-17 season, is not sure if he will get to stay on and start the new season or if the club will bring in a new coach. He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that the club will have a much better season this time &ndash; with or without me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s going to be with me or if they will find their dream coach somewhere &ndash; that it&rsquo;s not up to me. But I&rsquo;m pretty cool with everything. I&rsquo;m here to try to do my best every day.&rdquo;
