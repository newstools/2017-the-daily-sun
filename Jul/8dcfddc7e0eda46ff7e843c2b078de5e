THE Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) has welcomed a judgment in the North Gauteng High Court that sets aside a controversial contract for new locomotives. "We hope that the successful outcome of this review application will leave no one in doubt that in taking this case up the board acted to curb corruption," the Prasa board said in a statement earlier today. The contract, awarded to little-known company Swifambo Rail Leasing in 2013, became mired in controversy when an expos&eacute; by Rapport newspaper detailed Afro 4000 locomotives' unsuitability for local rail lines. The R3.5 billion contract with Swifambo for the new locomotives must now be set aside. The contract value later ballooned to more than R5 billion, of which nearly R4 billion has been paid by Prasa to Swifambo, with R80 million allegedly finding its way to the ANC. In handing down judgment, Judge J Francis remarked: "Harm will be done to the administration of justice if this award is not set aside from the onset. Corruption will triumph if this court does not set aside the tender."&nbsp; The Prasa board thanked "all the honest and brave Prasa employees who brought these acts of malfeasance to light". "We also express our appreciation to the members of the public, including the media, who supported the board as attempts were made to scupper the investigations and the prosecution of this case."
