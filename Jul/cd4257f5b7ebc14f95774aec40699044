ZWELINZIMA Vavi and his new workers&rsquo; federation seem to be on a mission to empty the Cosatu nest of members. Yesterday, Vavi welcomed 500 new workers to the South African Federation of Trade Unions, a workers&rsquo; federation he helped form last year. The new members are formerly from Nehawu, an affiliate of Cosatu. They are now members of the new South African Liberated Public Service Workers Union, an affiliate of Saftu. The recruits danced and sang at Potchestroom Hospital in North West, where Vavi welcomed them.&ldquo;You have taken the right decision to join this federation because it is truly independent from government and the ruling party. The other organisations cannot defend workers because they sleep in the same bed with the state and management for cabinet and corporate positions.&rdquo;He said that Saftu would fight for a better life for all, not only for Zuma and his family, and not for the ANC or for Cyril Ramaphosa. He urged other workers to join the new federation and say goodbye to unions that want to please the ANC. &ldquo;Saftu plans to win most government workers, fight labour brokering and fight for casual workers to be employed full-time,&rdquo; he said.After the address in Potchefstroom he went on to welcome more members in neighbouring Klerksdorp. He told the media that by December three Cosatu unions would have joined Saftu. Former Nehawu regional chairman Lucky Rampou, who was expelled from Cosatu, said: &ldquo;We served snakes before. Now we want to belong to a union that is not an ally with government.&rdquo;
