OPPOSITION parties say National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete should not supervise next month&rsquo;s vote of no confidence debate. The EFF&rsquo;s Julius Malema, Cope&rsquo;s Mosiuoa Lekota, the UDM&rsquo;s Bantu Holomisa, Athol Trollip of the DA, Kenneth Meshoe of the ACDP and Chris Mashigo of the Africa People&rsquo;s Convention met in Tshwane yesterday to discuss urgent political issues. Malema said it was important for the vote on whether President Jacob Zuma was fit to lead the country to be held in secret. He said Mbete should not be in charge of the debate over the vote as she is biased. He said if the vote of no confidence did not succeed, they would try to get Zuma impeached. &ldquo;No way can Zuma survive impeachment and the DA has over 700 cases against him,&rdquo; he said. He said it was important for the vote to be secret as ANC members had been threatened. &ldquo;It will help all members of parliament to vote according to their conscience,&rdquo; he said. Holomisa said they discussed issues around Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane&rsquo;s flip-flop over the Reserve Bank. &ldquo;We also reject the so-called apology of the racist firm, Bell Pottinger,&rdquo; said Holomisa.&ldquo;The ANC and its Gupta sponsors must explain why they allowed such raging racism to divide the nation.&rdquo;The parties called on all South Africans to march to parliament.&ldquo;Those who are not able to make it must engage in activities in their areas,&rdquo; he said.
