being charged, she only figured out she must have been raped when she
realised three months after her stay in hospital that she was pregnant. She was
especially amazed because her husband worked overseas at the time and she hadnâ€™t
had sex for a year.Tumukuratire was confronted by cops during their
investigation and confessed to sedating and raping the woman.He has not yet pleaded and his case is due to be heard at
the High Court on 18 August.
