MAMELODI Sundowns can look forward to a well deserved three-week break after they face DR Congo outfit AS Vita Club in their final group match in the Caf Champions League at the Lucas Moripe Stadium on Sunday (7pm).The defending African champions have already qualified for the quarterfinals along with Tunisian giants Esperance from Group C following their hard-fought 1-0 win over Saint George in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa at the weekend.&nbsp;Esperance meet Saint George in Tunis on Sunday at the same time.The final group matches will decide the winner of the group. Esperance are on top with nine points followed by Downs with eight. Saint George are on five and Vita have four.However, even if Saint George cause an unexpected upset and beat Esperance, Downs lose to Vita, and both St George and Downs end on eight points, the Brazilians have already booked their place in the quarterfinals on a better head-to-head record.&nbsp;Sundowns skipper Hlompho Kekana said the fact that they had qualified already was a blessing: &ldquo;We are determined not to concede and end the group on a high note.&rdquo;The hard-working Kekana, who had led by example again, said he wanted to play Egyptian super club Al Ahly in the quarterfinals.But in Group D anyone of Zanaco from Zambia, Wydad Casablanca and Al Ahly could qualify.&nbsp;The Zambians head the group with 11 points, followed by Moroccan outfit Wydad on nine and Al Ahly with eight.Al Ahly have an easy final match in Cairo against pointless Coton Sport while Zanaco travel to Casablanca to play Wydad. Both matches are on Saturday at 9pm.Said Kekana: &ldquo;I would prefer to play Al Ahly, as I don&rsquo;t see them beating us.&rdquo;The winners of Group C play the runners-up in Group D while the Group C runners-up play the Group D winners in the quarterfinals, which will be on a home-and-away knockout basis.Kekana said he was proud of his players after their gutsy win over Saint George: &ldquo;The pitch was a mess, very difficult to play on.&rdquo;He said the African champs could be boosted by the return of striker Khama Billiat from injury: &ldquo;Khama is back at training. It&rsquo;s great to have him fit again.&rdquo;Kekana expects another tough game from Vita despite the fact the DRC side can&rsquo;t progress: &ldquo;We are no longer the underdogs. Since we won the Champions League last year every team knows all about us. So we can&rsquo;t relax.&rdquo;Downs have been playing non-stop since August 2015 but said Kekana: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a three-week break after Sunday&rsquo;s game and that will help us to recharge our batteries.&rdquo; Entry to Sundowns&rsquo; match is free &ndash; as the saying goes: Come one, come all!
