ANC MP Dr Makhosi Khoza said a secret ballot in the vote of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma will protect MPs from being victimised, as she has been.She said this during a debate on the secret ballot in Salt River Community House in Cape Town on Tuesday.The panelists included UDM leader Bantu Holomisa and political analyst Professor Steven Friedman.Khoza said she and her children have received death threats because of her views.She argued that ANC MPs cannot cast their votes in the open because they fear the consequences of voting against President Zuma. &ldquo;Whatever the speaker decides is up to her.&ldquo;But I still think that if MPs were to vote openly, they will do so without their consciences. &ldquo;They will only vote because they have been instructed to do so, and their vote has consequences. &ldquo;If you vote the way you want to, you will be fired. &ldquo;These are not ordinary people saying these things. &ldquo;These are people who are in the leadership of the party.&ldquo;They are supposed to be protecting us. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think South Africans will have a president like this again,&rdquo; said Khoza.Holomisa said: &ldquo;This country is being controlled by two families: the Guptas and the Zumas. &ldquo;This is not what we joined the struggle for. &ldquo;Nobody can say Holomisa is lying when I say we trained the members of Umkhonto we Sizwe. &ldquo;Zuma is actually trampling on the legacy of Mandela and Oliver Tambo.&rdquo;He said the country&rsquo;s democracy has been hijacked because those in power receive instructions from individuals instead of the entire nation.Friedman said: &ldquo;We have talked several times about voting with your conscience. &ldquo;What kind of conscience can only be expressed in secret?&rdquo; UCT student Xolani Mdlala argued that the secret ballot will lead to secrecy and a lack of transparency in the long run.
