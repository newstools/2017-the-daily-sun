AFTER Police Minister Fikile Mbalula heard about the tragedy of a family in Alexandra in which a woman and her brother were shot by the woman&rsquo;s boyfriend, he went to visit the family yesterday.Mbalula first briefed the media at Alexandra Police Station and told the officers on duty there to &ldquo;go out there and arrest the suspect who pulled the trigger&rdquo;.Itumeleng Sefolo (25) and Tshepo (23) died on Sunday when Itumeleng&rsquo;s boyfriend shot and killed them both.Mbalula assured the family that police would work around the clock to trace the suspect until he is locked up.&ldquo;Officers will not rest until the man who killed the two is arrested,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A woman is not a man&rsquo;s property. They are partners. Abusers do not belong to our society. The community must help police to uproot the men who abuse women and children,&rdquo; Mbalula said.After the minister had left, residents took to the streets and marched on the streets of Alexandra, spreading the message that the kasi&rsquo;s community should stand and fight against the abuse of women and children.Men and women of all ages, including church leaders, politicians and civil organisation members, united with one voice to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the abuse of women and children.Afterwards, dozens of people filled the San Kopano Hall where they held a memorial service for the slain siblings. One speaker after the other spoke about how loving the deceased siblings had been.
