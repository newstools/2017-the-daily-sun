SUSPECTED thieves were paraded through the kasi on Monday morning by furious residents. The angry people of Peace Village in KwaNobuhle, Nelson Mandela Bay carried sticks, sjamboks and stones as they sang songs accusing their two &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; of stealing. The residents said over the past two weeks the men had been storming into houses and running off with microwave ovens, TVs, laptops, blankets and tiles. As people paraded the alleged thieves through neighbouring Joe Modise kasi, they went into a house and accused the owner of having bought tiles from the men. She denied the allegation but one of the suspects said: &ldquo;Sisi, you did buy tiles from me!&rdquo; The group then entered the woman&rsquo;s house and came back out with a pile of plastic tiles. The tiles were handed to one of the suspects, who carried them while the parade continued. Protest leader Ndimphiwe Mohapi (41) told Daily Sun: &ldquo;We are tired of thieves. Over the weekend they broke into two houses in Peace Village. They stole five bottles of brandy and at another house they took a microwave oven and blankets. &ldquo;We also went to raid houses in Chris Hani and found that a resident sold a microwave oven he had bought from thugs to a pawn shop.&ldquo;We will deal with all people who buy stolen items. We will moer anyone standing in our way. We will also name and shame the buyers of stolen items.&rdquo; Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli condemned the residents for taking the law into their own hands and said a patrol van would be sent to the area.
