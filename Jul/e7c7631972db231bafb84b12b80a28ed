EFF LEADER JULIUS Malema's case has been postponed. Malema's lawyer Tumi Mokoena requested a postponement pending the outcome of a High Court application on the same matter.&nbsp; Mokoena informed the court that they have approached the High Court to declare the Riotous Assemblies Act as illegal. Mokoena also told the court that the defence team only received the docket for Tuesday's matter in May when it was supposed to be delivered by the NPA in February.&nbsp; The matter was postponed to allow Malema to file his application. Magistrate Theunis Christiaan Lotter Colditz told Malema that the matter has been postponed until July 6, pending the filing of his application. The state will appear in court on Thursday to postpone the matter to September 1 if the defence files its papers. Malema said outside the court that the defence will use the Freedom Charter, statements made by Nelson Mandela and OR Tambo to defend his statements. "Our call still stands: People must occupy land. That is what the Freedom Charter says and if any court finds me guilty then it will have to find the Freedom Charter an illegal document,"&nbsp; Malema said he was just repeating what the Freedom Charter said. "I repeat what the generations before us said. So it is not me inventing new things. That is what the struggle has always been about."http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/defiant-malema-seeks-high-court-order-to-declare-land-invasion-charges-unconstitutional-20170704 #Malema: Malema says defence will use the Freedom Charter, statements made by Nelson Mandela and OR Tambo to defend his statements. @News24 pic.twitter.com/izFAu7Yppq&mdash; Amanda Khoza (@MandaKhoza) July 4, 2017 #Malema: Malema says the state is inconsiderate.
