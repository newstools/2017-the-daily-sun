THESE women became tired of unemployment. But instead of joining other women in the village who complained about joblessness, these ones decided to pick up their hammers and started crushing rocks.They dig the rocks using picks and shovels before crashing them to create concrete.When they started people laughed at them and thought they were being crazy but they soldiered on. Today they each take home between 1000 to 1500 per month.They sell the concrete to construction companies outside Giyani in Limpopo, where they are based.They are known as Nkurhi Concrete Project.The project was founded by a group of 18 unemployed women with the assistance of the Mopani District Municipality.In 2006, they won a Jet Community Award for the Swaziland, Mpumalanga and the Limpopo region.When they started they used to carry the heavy stones from the river to their facility with their hands, until a tractor was donated to them. One of the group members, Khumbani Mahori said: "We are appealing to be assisted with a TLB excavator to dig rocks, a truck to make deliveries and electricity installation."Another project member Mjhanjhi Hlungwani said: "Life has changed after I became a member of the project."She advised unemployed youth to create jobs for themselves.
