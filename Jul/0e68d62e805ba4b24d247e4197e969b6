DJ STEVE has refuted rumours that he&rsquo;s leaving Kalawa Jazmee.&nbsp; &ldquo;DJ Steve&rdquo;, real name Stephen Sitsha, told Sunday Sun he&rsquo;s not leaving Kalawa as people have been speculating.&nbsp; He only wants to focus on growing his own music label, Steve Group Records, he says.&nbsp; DJ Steve told the People&rsquo;s Paper: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still part of the Kalawa Jazmee family. I am who I am today because of them.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re part of my life, and my career is blossoming because of their input in my music.&rdquo;&nbsp; DJ Steve said after all these years at Kalawa, he could&rsquo;nt leave the record label because it had helped him learn new things.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be ungrateful of me really to bite the hand that feeds me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; DJ Steve says he wants to grow his company, with the support of Kalawa, and bring knowledge to his hometown of Tshwane, where he wants to help nurture young talent.&nbsp; The Ingoma hitmaker said he would rather focus on building his music career and label than listen to negativity.&nbsp; When the People&rsquo;s Paper asked DJ Oskido Mdlongwa for comment, he said DJ Steve was licensed at Kalawa Jazmee to be helped to grow like other artists.&nbsp; Said Oskido: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s growing his music label, which is very good, and we&rsquo;re aware of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; DJ Steve is working on his upcoming third album titled Reflection, to be released next month.&nbsp; In the album, he features Professor, Nokwazi, DJ Oskido, Candy &ldquo;Tsa Mandebele kids&rdquo;, Xoli M and Lady Zamar.&nbsp; He was among the DJs featured in the afterparty at the Durban July&rsquo;s DJU Mother Of All Parties at Kings Park Stadium yesterday
