DJ TIRA suffered a health scare shortly after his 67 minutes on Madiba Day.&nbsp; Sunday Sun can reveal that the Afrotainment boss, real name Mthokosizi Khathi, was rushed to the Umhlanga Netcare emergency room after suffering back pains.&nbsp; A well-placed source said: &ldquo;Everything was going well. He was in good spirits as always, but just as we finished our community service inKwaMashu, he started complaining about his heat,saying he felt drowsy.&nbsp;&ldquo;But when we got to his house, he was better and went into the studio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;He went to the kitchen to fetch refreshments for us. We heard a loud bang from the kitchen door.&nbsp; &ldquo;We found him lying on the floor, trying to get up. We carried him to the couch and his wife suggested that we take him to the hospital.&nbsp; &ldquo;His wife said she had been telling him to take a break from his busy schedule &ndash; but he was being stubborn.&rdquo;&nbsp; The SunTeam has learnt through the sources that DJ Tira didn&rsquo;t get enough sleep, as he was trying to be productive in everything he did.&nbsp; &ldquo;During preparations for the Durban July, he didn&rsquo;t sleep for three whole days.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, he still doesn&rsquo;t have enough sleep because he&rsquo;s preparing for his Gumba Fest in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sunday Sun contacted DJ Tira, who was at first reluctant to comment, and hung up the phone.&nbsp; But later on he called the SunTeam, asking: &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write about my music or Big Nuz? Why my state of health?&nbsp; &ldquo;I went to the hospital due to fatigue. I&rsquo;m going to take my wife&rsquo;s and the doctors&rsquo; orders and rest.&rdquo;
