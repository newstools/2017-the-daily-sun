We had five children together before he left me. &ldquo;I then found another man who fathered my last born.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was home with my children when suddenly a group of men arrived and forced us out of the house. They showed us eviction papers and claimed to have been sent by Joseph.&ldquo;They just dragged us out and locked the door.&rdquo; Joyce said she was allocated an RDP in 2002 by Ndwedwe Municipality and added two small houses without any help.&ldquo;I need help from the department of corporate governance and traditional affairs because traditional leadership lies with him.&rdquo;She said her relationship with Joseph went sour in 2012 when he refused to pay maintenance for the seven children.Joseph said he couldn&rsquo;t speak to the People&rsquo;s Paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy,&rdquo; he said and ended the call.Daily Sun tried without success to get comment from a local inkosi.Co-operative governance and traditional affairs spokesman Lennox Mabaso said they will send officials to investigate.&ldquo;Joyce needs to report it to cops and human settlements,&rdquo; said Mabaso.
