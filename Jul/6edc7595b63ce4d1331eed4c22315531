She even blocked my number when I kept asking for my money,” said Lebo.The single mum of three children told Sunday Sun they depended on the money to support their families.Emma said she had worked overtime on weekends, hoping to earn a better wage.“I’m hurt and upset that she lied to us. I’m stressed as I don’t have money to buy groceries,” she said.Nannies In Training agent’s Cindi van Jaarsveld said Sammy didn’t submit her agreement forms after she promised she would.“She said she deposited the money, but we didn’t receive it. We tried getting hold of her via email and telephonically, but she didn’t respond,” said Cindi.When the SunTeam contacted Sammy, at first she said she didn’t know about the claims, but quickly changed her tune, saying: “I won’t discuss this matter with you. I’m dealing with it legally.”
