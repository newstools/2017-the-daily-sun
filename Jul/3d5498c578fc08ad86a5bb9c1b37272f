Moments later Annah heard a group of people shouting. When she went to check what was going on, she couldn’t believe her eyes . . . “I felt as if my heart was going to stop when I saw him lying on the ground, with people throwing stones at him,” Annah told the People’s Paper. “When I begged the group of people to stop, they threatened to kill me.”She said they were accusing Kagiso of stealing the memory card. In desperation, she tried to phone the police. “They told me they didn’t have any vehicles available,” she said.She then phoned an ambulance, which only arrived after two hours.“They took Kagiso to the hospital, but his injuries were too severe. He died a few hours after being admitted,” she said. Northam police spokesman Lieutenant-General Noko Kgosiyadira said they were not aware of the incident, but police had since contacted the family.“Police are investigating a case of murder,” said Kgosiyadira.
