IN HIS quest to make the fistic sports popular in his home province, budding boxing promoter, Lebo Mahoko, aims to take boxing to another level.&nbsp;Boxing South Africa&rsquo;s promising promoter says he will continue taking the sport to the deepest corners of the Free State.This after a successful boxing tournament he staged in Phuthaditjhaba, in QwaQwa, last week.This was the first time professional boxing was staged in the area.Mahoko told SunSport: &ldquo;The response was encouraging and will continue to promote boxing to new audiences.&ldquo;The turnout was good, I wasn&rsquo;t anticipating such a big crowd,&rdquo; he said.He added: &ldquo;People in theses areas don&rsquo;t have many options as far as entertainment is concerned. So, when you bring them something they&rsquo;re not used to they come in numbers.&ldquo;The popular sport in the province is soccer, I also want to make boxing popular,&rdquo; said Mahoko.According to the Bloemfontein-based Dream Team boss, big fights are only staged in big cities at the expense of smaller ones.&ldquo;QwaQwa is one of the largest townships in Mzansi, but it has never hosted a professional boxing tournament, while big townships in big cities enjoy boxing action.&rdquo;Mahoko acquired his boxing promoting licence in 2015 and has staged most of his tournaments in Bloemfontein.He hopes to stage tournaments all over the Free State to woo young people to love boxing, and hopefully surpass the Eastern Cape as &ldquo;The Boxing Mecca&rdquo;.
