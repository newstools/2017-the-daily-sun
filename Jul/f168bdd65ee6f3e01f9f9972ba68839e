But it seems Mangaliso went ahead with his usual routine of going fishing at Spaarwater Dam, not far from his house. She wishes he had listened to her.“Mangaliso has been fishing for many years and we did not expect this to happen. “That day, I called him and asked him to come and see me because it had been a while since he had paid me a visit and we had not been talking. “He had been spending a lot of time at the river,” said gogo Nelly.Mangaliso and his friend Joseph Gadebe were known by their community as fishmongers.Every morning, residents would gather at a corner while the two delivered fish fresh from the nearby dam.His disappearance has saddened his customers and the entire community. They are praying for his safe return and hope he is found alive.On Friday, police divers and the dog unit called off their search at sunset but were set to begin again yesterday.His family said all they are hoping for now is that his body is recovered as they believe he may have drowned. Police spokesman Harry Manaka said a missing person’s case has been reported at Duduza Police Station.“Police divers and dog handlers will continue the search for any trace that might lead to Mangaliso’s discovery or any other clues.”
