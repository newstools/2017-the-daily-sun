SOUTH Africa Under-17 coach Molefi Ntseki says they are still facing some challenges on selecting a 21-man squad that will represent Mzansi in the COSAFA Cup in Mauritius.&nbsp;The Under-17 COSAFA Cup is scheduled from 21-30 July. In the last edition Amajimbos made it to the finals of the tournament, where they were defeated by Namibia 5-4 on penalties after a goalless draw in regular time.&nbsp;On Saturday, a squad of 25-players reported for the camp.&nbsp;Coach Ntseki was supposed to select the final team on Sunday but he postponed it for today because some of these youngsters don&rsquo;t have all the documents that are needed.Ntseki said: At the moment we busy trying to compile all the players who have all the documents. &nbsp;Some of these players don&rsquo;t have the passport they only have their certificates which is a challenge for us.&nbsp;&ldquo;Hopefully by tomorrow (Tuesday) all things will be sorted.&rdquo;The team will leave for Mauritius tomorrow, as the competition will be kicking off on Friday.&nbsp;Mzansi will compete in the Under-17 tournament with U/14 and 15.Ntseki said he&rsquo;s preparing these youngsters for next years African Youth qualifiers.&nbsp;&ldquo;The challenge with U/17 is that every second year you bring in new players. We selected this age group because we want them to be exposed to the international level before the Youth qualifiers and the World Cup.GOALKEEPERS: 1.
