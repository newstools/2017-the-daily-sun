BAFANA Bafana trialists gave head coach Stuart Baxter something to think about ahead of the 2018 Russia World Cup qualifying campaign.&nbsp;Bafana will feature in back-to-back qualifying matches against Cape Verde Islands next month. The development team made up of locally based players impressed to register a 1-0 victory over Botswana in the African Nations Championship (CHAN) second-leg qualifier at Moruleng Stadium in North West yesterday.&nbsp;Goal poacher Ryan Moon&rsquo;s early first half strike was the match winner.&nbsp;Bafana advanced to the second and final round of the qualifiers with an emphatic 3-0 win on aggregate.&nbsp;They will face Zambia in the last round of the qualifiers and the first leg will be played in Mzansi on the weekend of 11-13 August with the return leg scheduled for Lusaka a week later.&nbsp;Zambia are standing in the way of Bafana&rsquo;s way of booking their trip to Kenya for the bi-annual tournament in January 2018. Bafana&rsquo;s development players were auditioning for places in Baxter squad for the all-important world qualifying campaign.&nbsp;The players that feature in this match may not be regular campaigners in the Bafana team, but they definitely gave Baxter something to ponder for the future.&nbsp;The auditions were not limited to the Bafana team only as some of the players were looking to impress their club coaches too. Kaizer Chiefs youngster Moon has also raised his hand to be considered for selection in coach Steve Khomphela&rsquo;s team for the 2017-18 season.&nbsp;The 20-year-old scored two goals over the two legs.&nbsp;Moon is one of the players that impressed in the two matches.&nbsp;The likes of lanky defender Mario Booysen, who captained the team and Cole Alexander, Siphelele Ntshangase of Black Leopards and Sipho Mbule, who featured for the national under-20 in the World Cup finals in South Korea, have made themselves an option in case of injury and suspension to regular players in future important international matches.&nbsp;Baxter&rsquo;s men cruised to a 2-0 over the Zebras the first leg in Francistown last week to all but end their struggling neighbours&rsquo; hopes. Moon and Gift Motupa&rsquo;s goals did the damage to the Zebras, who have now lost their last three games against Bafana in a short space of three weeks.&nbsp;Baxter has every reason to be happy with his bunch of players who kept two clean sheets against the Zebras. But a bigger test lies ahead against Zambia, who have given Bafana problems in the past.&nbsp;Even if these players don&rsquo;t feature in the games against Cape Verde and Burkina Faso for the World Cup campaign, they have provided options for the coach. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
