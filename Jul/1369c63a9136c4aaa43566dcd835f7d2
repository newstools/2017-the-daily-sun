She was surrounded by family and friends at a party held for her in Chiawelo, Soweto. Gogo Nyanisi said she owed her long life to her love of mopane worms and spinach. &ldquo;Mopane worms and spinach are my favourite. I have been eating them for years. I used to prepare them for myself, but now my family don&rsquo;t want me near a stove.&rdquo;She told Daily Sun she was blessed with eight kids but seven have died. She is left with one daughter, Benvoiless Khubayi (53). Gogo Nyanisi has 24 grandchildren, 24 great-grandkids and three great-great-grandchildren!Benvoiless said: &ldquo;Even though I&rsquo;m the only child left, my mum has been blessed with many grandchildren who look after her. &ldquo;My mum loves to do things for herself, but we recently stopped her because of her age. She still has a great memory and she can walk, sit and do most things on her own. We are very proud to have her in our lives.&rdquo;
