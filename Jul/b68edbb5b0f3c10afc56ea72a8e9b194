Celebs are always inspiring us.&nbsp; And now that winter is almost over, here is some motivation to get shredded for the summer.&nbsp; Whether they at the gym or just chilling, these celebs inspire us to get our gym clothes on and get into shape.&nbsp; See pictures below of some celebs in their gym wear:&nbsp; I have some great news??so remember I asked a while back if you would be keen to attend a workout workshop if I arranged one. And many of you said yes... It's confirmed I will be celebrating dynamic woman and working out with you in ways I currently enjoy. It will be a day of spoils ??Although there will be limited spots available. If this workout workshop is a hit, I promise to make an even better one next year! I would honestly love to just meet you, workout with you, spend one on one time with you and have a session together where we feel empowered. This workout workshop with me in collaboration with @adidasza will be on 8 July 2017. It will include a morning of workouts and spoils.
