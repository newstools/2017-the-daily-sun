FROM today, Nhlanhla Nene will take up the post of director of the Wits Business School. The axed former finance minister was rumoured to be joining Brics Bank after President Jacob Zuma replaced him in December 2015. But that never happened and Nene himself apparently never knew about it. Wits Business School said once a new head was appointed, Nene would continue to serve as an honorary professor and scholar in residence.Wits vice-chancellor Adam Habib said: &ldquo;We are honoured to welcome Mr Nene to lead the school.&rdquo;He said Nene&rsquo;s political credence, business expertise and intellect placed him in a good position to lead the school as they search for a permanent head. &ldquo;His leadership, advice and insight at this pivotal time in our country&rsquo;s economic trajectory will add value to the quality of courses, public lectures, debates and research that we offer.&rdquo; Nene said he was happy to join the school. &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to join the Wits Business School. It will enable me to share my knowledge, experience and networks in order to empower and work with young, talented individuals, academics and business leaders. The appointment was made possible by the Thebe Investment Corporation, who allowed me the time and space to undertake this important task.&rdquo; Vusi Khanyile, chairman of Thebe Investment, said: &ldquo;We wish Mr Nene well in this new endeavour and assure him, and Wits, of our support through this process.&rdquo;
