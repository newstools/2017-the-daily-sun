THE Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans&rsquo; Association, have been at the forefront of defending the Gupta family.New evidence from the #GuptaLeaks emails reveals that this loyalty has come at a price.However, with the Guptas footing the bill for the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans' Association&rsquo;s four-day national general council in 2010, and issuing the group shares in their company.Consider the military veterans officially captured.Organising political events can be an expensive business &ndash; especially for a group like the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans&rsquo; Association (MKMVA), which has been plagued by allegations of looting by its leadership for years.In such situations, it helps to have rich friends. Enter the Guptas. Emails from the #GuptaLeaks trove show that the Guptas picked up the R850 000 bill from the MKMVA&rsquo;s 2010 national general council, with the money deposited straight into the MKMVA&rsquo;s bank account.In August 2010, the personal assistant of MKMVA treasurer-general Sparks Motseki emailed Gupta lieutenant Ashu Chawla:"Kindly receive the MKMVA banking details as discussed with the Treasurer-General, Comrade Sparks Motseki."Attached to the email was an invoice for R850 855.40, for conference facilities, accommodation and food for four days at the Booysens Hotel and Conference Centre, south of Johannesburg. Included in the bill was a "gala dinner" totalling R45 500.The emails do not record a direct response from Chawla, but the evidence shows that the bill was promptly paid. On August 19, 2010, Motseki&rsquo;s PA emailed Chawla: "This serves to acknowledge the receipt of the sum of R850,000.00 transferred yesterday the 18th of August 2010 to MKMVA Pfumo account."Separately, the Gupta emails also confirm, as reported by Mail &amp; Guardian in 2011, that MKMVA was given shares in the Guptas&rsquo; companies. An affidavit from 4 July 2014, signed by the MKMVA&rsquo;s Thembile Magingxa, states that MKMVA was issued shares in the Guptas&rsquo; Islandsite Investments in 2011. MKMVA leader Kebby Maphatsoe was also invited to the Guptas&rsquo; controversial 2013 Sun City wedding.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/guptaleaks-how-the-guptas-picked-up-mk-vets-conference-tab-20170718
