reasonable efforts to fairly present opposing points of view, on 
the same program or on a subsequent program.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsujMgw3iF5vQC3tWvOulzPGj92q2Pjph-0UptBBMSQe4zITPJbj9aNAapY-hgsIjxfz3adEB0O9Nz-Tg245BzEfo7b-1HtVriQ2Z9j-j41o5-K0DlHt95nMrl5rKWlPcajYvYpxmWTttJpqWJrnD_V5CBPwrA_gTalnSBLp5BVBLcMwkUw9Q0zKvNCvZT4sWsRagVUOes9N553y1CcHOJfj8PetCriKdfXd3Q1wKtPJipdy452Is4Kb-pobcGVn2_P4UAqpdtgy7ItfVrKHuJnd7oqVy_s\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMbxZSuB5pJ1EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

says a person whose views are criticised must be given the right to reply.The
 BCCSA said McKaiser created a "hostile environment" on the program when he broadcast a clip of a 1993 speech by former president FW de Klerk out of context on May 7 at 10am on 702 and Cape Talk, which discussed "the controversial issue of the 
role of ex-president FW de Klerk in the political discourse on the 
future of this country".After playing an extract of De Klerk’s 
speech, in which he authorised a raid on a base in Umtata in which some 
children died, McKaiser and his guest agreed De Klerk had 
to take responsibility for the deed because "the buck stops with the 
president".McKaiser said De Klerk had not apologised for his 
part in the oppression of black people and had not played open 
cards with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.The FW de Klerk Foundation, through chairperson Dave Steward, lodged a complaint with the BCCSA after the broadcast.Steward
 phoned in during the show and complained that there was a lack of balance 
in the programme and De Klerk had not been given the 
opportunity to respond.He pointed out that De Klerk had been
 instrumental in creating the new democratic system in South 
Africa and that Nelson Mandela had praised him for his role.McKaiser 
replied that Steward could not tell black people they could 
not save themselves, and that Steward was "laughable". McKaiser said "Who the hell are you?" before cutting Steward’s call.Steward
 said McKaiser had not made reasonable efforts to fairly present 
opposing points of view and the person criticised was not given the right to reply.the BCCSA found that McKaiser demonstrated intolerance towards opposing views and made no 
reasonable efforts to fairly present opposing points of views.It 
found that no right to reply was granted to De Klerk or his spokesperson on a programme clearly 
intended to criticise De Klerk.McKaiser could not be reached for comment.
