IT looks like the relationship between radio and TV personality Bonang Matheba and AKA is headed for greater heights.&nbsp; Sources close to the couple say things are getting pretty serious for them, and allege that the pair has moved in together.&nbsp; One source told Sunday Sun AKA (real name Kiernan Forbes) has been calling high-end jewellery stores checking out pricey engagement rings.&nbsp; The source claims that Super Mega, as AKA is also known, has approached a renowned jewellery maker to inquire about having a special ring made.&nbsp; The source also alleged that AKA was also hoping to get a sponsored diamond ring &ndash; or a discount on it.&nbsp; The Sunday Sun mole claimed AKA had promised some jewellery stores that if they gave him the ring, he would get them publicity.&nbsp; &ldquo;He promised to mention the jewellery store on his social media pages, provided they gave him the ring,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; Another source said most of the stores he had approached turned him down. The second source said AKA asked the jewellery store about a &ldquo;free ring&rdquo; deal reportedly struck by Minnie and her fiance, Quinton Jones.&nbsp; A third source said the two were ready to settle down.&nbsp; The source said Bonang&rsquo;s mum Charlotte Mokoena had finally warmed up to AKA.&nbsp; &ldquo;At first, she didn&rsquo;t like how the two met and what happened. But she&rsquo;s fine now,&rdquo; said the source.&nbsp; Both AKA and Bonang were not available for comment, as their phones rang unanswered.&nbsp; Charlotte could not be reached for comment. When contacted, AKA&rsquo;s manager Prince Costinyo refused to comment, saying that it&rsquo;d spoil things.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to you, it&rsquo;d mess up a big thing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; Bonang&rsquo;s manager Sylvesta Chauke told the SunTeam to wait for an announcement.&nbsp;
