ORLANDO PIRATES players allegedly escaped from their Three City Hotel at Umhlanga Rocks in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal. They allegedly went on a drinking spree at Azar nightclub. It allegedly happened on Friday last week – before the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday. Sunday Sun has heard allegations that babalas was one of the reasons why Orlando Pirates lost to SuperSport United in the big match at Moses Mabhida Stadium. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>The People’s Paper has learnt from reliable sources that four key Bucs players allegedly came back in the early hours of Saturday smelling of booze. They were: midfielder and dribbling wizards Thabo Rakhale and Thabo Qalinge, defensive midfielder Luvuyo Memela and goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo. Bucs lost to Matsantsantsa a Pitori by 4-1. Sources claim the four players went to the nightclub and were drinking expensive wines and cocktails. “They don’t respect the club and it’s not the first time they’ve done this. “They would miss camp before the game and go clubbing when they had a game the following day,” the source said. “We have a crisis, and the sad part is that fans lose out. They pay their money to come to stadiums to see their club – only to go home disappointed. “They stayed in the club until the wee hours of the morning.” Another source further claimed: “They had Durban girls all over them and the mood was like they had won the cup. While, in fact, they were supposed to be resting and preparing for the game. “Instead, they were dancing and drinking booze the whole night. “Some were enjoying their wine and others were getting busy with Durban’s hotties.” Azar’s manager, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We won’t be able to help you with that. “We have a lot of customers and we don’t ask them who they are and where are they from.” Qalinge said: “I won’t say we did or did not, but clearly you must be beware that such information is not true.” Bucs spokesperson, Thandi Merafe, said she wouldn’t comment on the issue, if we didn’t reveal our sources. Rakhale, Mhlongo and Memela refused to comment.
