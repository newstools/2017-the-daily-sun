According to Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi, the defiant break-in took place at the Promat Building in Silverton, Pretoria.Mulaudzi said they became aware that the items were stolen early yesterday, but the burglary could have taken place on Tuesday night.It is unclear at this stage if any confidential information relating to ongoing investigations was taken.&ldquo;Investigators are currently working at the scene and more information will be communicated in due course. &ldquo;The Hawks would like to confirm that so far, only computers were stolen from the finance, supply chain management and human resource management offices.&rdquo;He said acting national head of the Hawks, Lieutenant- General Yolisa Matakata, had condemned the incident.Matakata assured citizens that a crack team will oversee an investigation into the incident. &ldquo;More information will be communicated in due course.&rdquo;Mulaudzi said they are still trying to find out if any documents were missing. &ldquo;This will only be confirmed once the forensic fingerprints team has done their work.&rdquo; He said there were no visible signs of a break-in.&ldquo;The only way to access the environment is to use access cards,&rdquo; said Mulaudzi.&ldquo;We will be looking at security to see if it is up to scratch or not, and if it is not, surely we must take action.&rdquo;Meanwhile, it was also announced that the Centurion Licensing Centre was forced to temporarily shut down after it was burgled, with the suspects making off with computers, eNatis screens and camera equipment.Tshwane Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the centre had closed its doors for the day to allow police to investigate.The centre would be operational again on Thursday but would offer limited services such as learner licence testing, practical driver testing and collection of new licence cards. &ldquo;There will not be any licence renewal services offered until further notice. &ldquo;The city&rsquo;s customers interested in licensing services are advised to visit Akasia and/or Bronkhorstspruit Licensing Centres, which are fully operational.&rdquo; Two men appeared in court in Mamelodi yesterday accused of another robbery at the office of the Chief Justice in Midrand.
