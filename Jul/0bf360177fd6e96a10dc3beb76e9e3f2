IN 2011, Mzansi was outraged when a pregnant woman was stabbed in the stomach. Despite being stabbed several times, Connie Bhuda (34) of Mamelodi West, east of Tshwane delivered a healthy baby. Daily Sun published her story with the headline, &ldquo;My little miracle&rdquo;. The attacker, her fellow tenant, was given people&rsquo;s justice by angry residents and was hospitalised. He was released into police custody and was sentenced to seven years in jail. Although Connie said justice was served, she needs a disability grant because she can no longer work. She said she used to work as a domestic worker but the pain she felt from her injuries while working was unbearable and she had to quit. &ldquo;I would feel severe pain whenever I touched water. I would scream in pain and my employers would be scared that I was dying.&rdquo; She said her employer advised her to quit for the sake of her health.&ldquo;I have three young children who depend on me.&rdquo; She said her injuries have made her life hell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m now a disabled person because I depend on other people. &ldquo;I cannot do anything for myself and my partner has to cook and clean for me. &ldquo;This is unfair because he has to go do piece jobs and when he comes home, he is tired.&rdquo; Connie said she would like to get a disability grant. &ldquo;I can no longer work for myself and the grant money I get for my children is not enough to support us. &ldquo;I need a disability grant because I can no longer work, although I&rsquo;m still young,&rdquo; she said. She said she forgave her attacker but the pain she now suffers made her change her mind. &ldquo;He destroyed my life. I was young and beautiful and earning a salary. Today, I&rsquo;m a couch potato thanks to him. I will never forget what he did to me.&rdquo; Daily Sun contacted Sassa spokesman Kgomoco Diseko who said Connie should visit their offices. &ldquo;She should go to the nearest Sassa office with all her medical records and apply for a disability grant,&rdquo; he said.
