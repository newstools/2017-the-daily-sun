THE SABC's former chief financial officer, James Aguma, may have resigned and had disciplinary charges against him dropped, but he is not off the hook yet.Aguma could still face criminal charges pending a forensic investigation into irregular and wasteful expenditure at the SABC, interim board chair Khanyisile Kweyama said at his disciplinary hearing in Sandton today.Aguma's lawyer earlier announced that his client was resigning from the public broadcaster.He had faced 10 charges including breaching his fiduciary duties.Kweyama said certain contracts entered into during Aguma's tenure had been referred to the Special Investigating Unit. Should he be implicated in wrongdoing he could face criminal charges.Aguma allegedly awarded Lorna Vision, which the SABC had hired to collect TV licence fees, a contract without following proper tender process. The interim board said it intended to recover its money should the SIU's &nbsp;investigations find the Lorna Vision contract was in violation of the law.Lorna Vision took legal action to recover what it argued was money the SABC still owed it for its work.Kweyama denied claims that the interim board had let Aguma off easily. He would not get a "golden handshake", she said."There is no settlement discussion, so this is what you call a normal resignation."She suggested that Aguma was pushed to resign after receiving documents his lawyer Osborne Molatudi had requested. These included minutes of the SABC board's meeting at which it resolved to have him suspended.Meanwhile, the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) has labelled Aguma's sudden resignation as "an admission of guilt".Scopa chair Themba Godi said the committee was "shocked" by Aguma's resignation before his disciplinary proceedings were concluded."Scopa takes this as admission of guilt for the financial mess the SABC finds itself in," Godi said in a statement today."Mr Aguma might have avoided scrutiny on a litany of charges he was facing &ndash; but as Scopa we call on the SABC interim board to pursue its investigation to ascertain criminal liability on the part of all officials and managers at the SABC, including Mr Aguma."Godi said the committee believed some officials, including Aguma, had a further case to answer after an internal audit report on "evergreen contracts" at the broadcaster.The committee called on the internal forensic audit unit of the SABC and the SIU to expedite processes so that those liable could be held to account for irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure.Godi congratulated the SABC interim board for its "relentless effort" to "clean the SABC and end the impunity that wrongdoers like Mr Aguma have enjoyed for so long".
