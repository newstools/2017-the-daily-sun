PRIMEDIA Broadcasting CEO Omar Essack said management would try to determine whether a controversial tweet by Radio 702 came from a place of naivety or racism. This is after social media erupted following a tweet on Sunday that left many stunned. The radio station&rsquo;s Twitter account posted a tweet that appeared to compare two black kids with two dogs, saying: &ldquo;Aaaaw! Dog vs Baby . . . Who is cuter? Go ahead and evoke those broody feelings.&rdquo; This angered many South Africans, especially blacks. Essack said after speaking to the team responsible, the idea had apparently been to post pictures of cute kids and pets at the Walk the Talk event because of their appeal. &ldquo;In trying to be clever, the tweet conflated the two without thinking about the implications.&rdquo; Essack said 702 had people from all walks of life working at the organisation. He said this meant that different people viewed things differently, but with Western culture dominating, certain views and cultural opinions might be suppressed. Presenter Xolani Gwala expressed his disappointment live on air yesterday morning. He described the tweets as despicable and distasteful, especially as they came from a company in the communications industry. &ldquo;I read the tweet over and over again, trying to understand what it was conveying. The person who posted it doesn&rsquo;t understand that we tell people&rsquo;s stories, nor the people&rsquo;s stories we are telling. I have spoken to a lot of people, including black people in our team and we are all really angered by this,&rdquo; Gwala said. He slammed the station&rsquo;s management for its apology. &ldquo;It is unacceptable. The apology is half-baked. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t give context to what happened or whether any action will be taken against the person responsible.&rdquo;
