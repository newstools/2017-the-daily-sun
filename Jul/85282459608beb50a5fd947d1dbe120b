HIS father&rsquo;s one of Mzansi&rsquo;s own A-list celebs.&nbsp;Not only is the Sushi King renowned for his expensive taste and penchant for the finest things in life . . .&nbsp;FROM THE LOOK OF THINGS, BABY SUSHI, OR NOW BETTER KNOWN AS BABY BILLIONAIRE, IS A CHIP OFF THE RICH BLOCK!In fact, this oh-so-blessed 10-week-old blessing&rsquo;s possessions are so expensive, they cost more than most people&rsquo;s annual salaries.And in case some of you &ldquo;haters and non-believers&rdquo; have any doubts, Baby Billionaire Kunene &ndash; as he&rsquo;s known on Instagram &ndash; racks up an impressively huge bill on what most parents consider essentials.For instance, some of his items include a Mimo feeding chair (R8&thinsp;000), an imported Cybex black-and-gold pram by Jeremy Scott (R80&thinsp;000), a Louis Vuitton towel imported by the brand&rsquo;s store in the Sandton City shopping centre specially for the youngest of the Kunenes (more than R8 000) and a designer closet with interior lighting (more than R50&thinsp;000).And according to an Instagram video, baby Remo Mokgethwa Kunene&rsquo;s pram is the only one of its kind in Mzansi.Still not convinced? Then prepare to be blown away!During the SunTeam&rsquo;s tour of the Kunene palace, Remo&rsquo;s closet was filled with nothing but designer &ldquo;couture&rdquo;, including Billionaire Italian Couture, Young Versace, Lacoste, Etienne Aigner, Polo by Ralph Lauren, Air Jordan, Ferrari, Mamas and Papas, Gucci and Hugo Boss, among others.And proud dad Kenny is only too happy to splurge on his bundle of joy.Sushi King, who also has three other children, said: &ldquo;People mustn&rsquo;t judge me for splurging on my child when he&rsquo;s still so young. Instead of bashing me, people must work hard so they too can afford the best things for their children.&ldquo;And, if you can afford to spend for your child as much as I do for mine but aren&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t criticise me. Stay stingy!&ldquo;But, we love our boy.&rdquo;In fact, his love for Remo has always reached down into the Sushi King&rsquo;s deep pockets.This was evidenced when Kenny secured a luxury maternity room at the clinic where his son was born &ndash; so he could spend unlimited time with his wife, Whitney, and Baby Billionaire Kunene.And after some digging, the SunTeam has learnt the Kunenes paid a whopping R4&thinsp;000 daily rate, excluding massive medical costs, during their three-day stay for Remo&rsquo;s birth.A first-time mum, Whitney couldn&rsquo;t stop praising the Sushi King&rsquo;s &ldquo;commitment and dedication&rdquo; to his marriage and fatherly duties.Insisted umakoti: &ldquo;He was very supportive throughout my pregnancy, so much so that he accompanied me on every trip to the gynecologist.&ldquo;Most priceless, however, was that he was by my side when Remo was born and also cut the umbilical chord. I&rsquo;m grateful to God for giving me my dream husband and a handsome baby.&rdquo;And in conclusion, Kenny had stern words for the youth: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a baby if you can&rsquo;t afford yourself. To aspiring parents, build yourself financially first, so you can support your child&rsquo;s needs and give them the lifestyle your parents couldn&rsquo;t afford to give you.&rdquo;Remo has more than 6 000 followers on Instagram.Follow Remo on Instagram @babybillionairekunene to stay up to date on his latest adventures.&nbsp;
