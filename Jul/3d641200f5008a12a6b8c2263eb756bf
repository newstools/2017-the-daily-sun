SOUTH Africa might host the next African Nations Championship (Chan) should hosts Kenya fail to meet the standards set by the Confederation of Africa Football (Caf).It is believed South Africa and Morocco are the two nations on standby in case Kenya does not meet the Caf requirements.Caf president Ahmad Ahmad is hosting an important symposium in Morocco this week and the Caf executive will meet on Friday to discuss the issue and decide whether Kenya&rsquo;s infrastructure and facilities are up to standard.Ahmad said two countries &ndash; Morocco and South Africa &ndash; could step in for Kenya. However, Morocco is favoured as the country not only has top facilities but also has never hosted Chan.&nbsp;SA was the host in 2014. SA Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan, who is in Morocco for the important Caf indaba this week, downplayed the chances of Mzansi hosting a second Chan tournament.Said Jordaan from Rabat in Morocco yesterday regarding the matter: &ldquo;There is another country (Morocco) which is seen as favourite to step in. There is nothing more I can say on the matter, as we have to wait until Friday to find out if Kenya are ready or not to host the event.&ldquo;It is sheer speculation, so I can&rsquo;t elaborate any further, as we are all waiting for the report from Caf (technical committee) to find out whether Kenya can host Chan.&rdquo;Ahmad made it clear when he was at Safa House in Joburg recently that he was not happy with the progress in Kenya, where there is also a lot of political issues which may derail the East African nation&rsquo;s plans of hosting Chan.He hinted South Africa could be one of the alternatives: &ldquo;If the Kenya Football Association fails to meet requirements then I can assure the public the event will take place as scheduled from 11 January to 2 February in another country with facilities and infrastructure that meet Caf requirements.&rdquo;Connecting the dots, another purpose of Ahmad&rsquo;s recent visit to SA may have been to look at the facilities in the country and see how people responded to the Cosafa Cup in Rustenburg.
