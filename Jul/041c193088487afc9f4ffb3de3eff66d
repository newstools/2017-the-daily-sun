Mbali Nhlangulela (30), the family&rsquo;s spokeswoman, said they would wait for the law to take its course.&ldquo;We have so many unanswered questions about my brother in-law&rsquo;s murder. &ldquo;The only way we will get answers about his brutal murder is if we let cops do their job without interfering,&rdquo; she said.The gunmen allegedly ambushed Mkhize and fired shots at his car. He was struck 18 times.&ldquo;He died instantly. Luckily he was alone in the car. We&rsquo;re deeply hurt because we didn&rsquo;t see this coming. &ldquo;Sifiso had no idea somebody was planning a hit on him,&rdquo; said Mbali, Sifiso&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s youngest sister.Mkhize is the third member of the Richmond Municipality to be killed this year.A few months ago, municipal manager Sibusiso Sithole and deputy mayor Thandazile Phoswa were gunned down in separate incidents.Mayor Sibusiso Mchunu urged residents to remain calm while the incident is investigated.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re working closely with the cops to ensure the suspects are brought to book.&rdquo; Mdumiseni Ntuli, the ANC spokesman in the province, called on law enforcement agencies to act quickly to arrest the culprits. &ldquo;Mkhize has been a champion of peace in his ward. &ldquo;Apart from being a councillor he was also the chairman of the local community policing forum.&rdquo; Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo, the provincial Hawks spokesman, said a case of murder was being investigated. &ldquo;The motive for the killing is not yet known and no arrests have been made yet.&rdquo;
