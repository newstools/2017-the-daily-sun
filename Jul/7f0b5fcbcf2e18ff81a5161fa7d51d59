JUSTIN Badenhorst was driving back home with two friends. The 28-year-old man from Riverlea, Joburg didn&rsquo;t realise that people had been following them from the Trade Route Mall in Lenasia, south of Joburg. Suddenly, one of the four men in a Toyota Yaris pointed a gun at Justin! He told Daily Sun: &ldquo;I was at the robot in Mondeor when I noticed the man pointing a gun at me. I panicked and sped off. The men gave chase. I was terrified because they were armed.&rdquo;Justin said as much as he wanted to get away from the criminals, he was also worried about losing control of his VW Jetta.&ldquo;I wanted to slow down but at the same time I feared they would open fire. I drove while praying that nothing would happen to us.&rdquo; The thugs were about to catch up with them when he decided to hit his brakes. &ldquo;This led to the men losing control of their car. I had a chance to get out of my car and screamed for help.&rdquo; Residents heard Justin and came out to see what was happening. &ldquo;They caught two of the suspects. The other two managed to get away, leaving their car behind,&rdquo; said Justin.People then beat the two suspects while waiting for cops to arrive. A resident said they are tired of thugs terrorising the community. &ldquo;When we call the police, they arrest them and release them the same day. It&rsquo;s best to deal with them ourselves.&rdquo; The two suspects were treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital.Gauteng police spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo said cops are investigating a case of attempted hijacking. He urged the public not to take the law into their own hands.
