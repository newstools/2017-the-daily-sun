WHEN 67-year-old Motlalepule Machogo&rsquo;s son came to tell her of the flames in his sister&rsquo;s bedroom, she feared the worst.But then came the sound of breaking glass and a strong voice &ndash; SunHero Tebogo Thebe (42) had arrived to save the family!The fire started in a house in Thaba Nchu, Free State on Tuesday night.Tebogo said when he saw smoke coming from his neighbour&rsquo;s roof, he grabbed a spade and ran to the house. He rescued the mother and her two mentally ill children, who were trapped inside the eight-roomed home. &ldquo;I heard people crying inside. When I got there, I looked through the window and saw my neighbour holding her head and screaming. &ldquo;I broke a window with my spade and pulled out all three of them. After they were safe, I ran to the garage, broke a window of the car and pushed it out.&rdquo;Motlalepule said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be alive. I thought I would die in the blaze with my children, but Tebogo got us out in time. &ldquo;I lost everything in the fire that I worked so hard for. We are left with only our pyjamas. &ldquo;I was tired from working night shift. My daughter must have knocked the heater over.&rdquo; Sergeant Martin Xuma said cops are trying to determine the cause of the blaze. &ldquo;The fire department arrived and put out the fire.&ldquo;People should call 10111 when they need the police, and 10117 when they need an ambulance or firefighters.&rdquo;
