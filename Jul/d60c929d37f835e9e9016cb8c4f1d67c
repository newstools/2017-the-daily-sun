These insults come from souls with no content. They are simply there to silence me,” she wrote.On Friday KZN ANC Women’s League secretary Nonhlanhla Gabela said Khoza was undermining the ANC.“The Women’s League in KZN notes with disgust the unethical behaviour of Dr Khoza,” said Gabela.She said that Khoza had a history of ill discipline.“Her renewed attacks on ANC elected leaders are not new.“ The ANC also has to blame itself for being so tolerant of her rants whenever she has been overlooked for a senior position. “In 2011 Khoza cried foul after she withdrew her application for the position of city manager at eThekwini Municipality.“The Women’s League will defend the ANC against all forms of opportunism.”Khoza said: “Prison awaits the looters of state resources. “I am determined to fight corruption and get us on the path to prosperity for all South Africans.”
