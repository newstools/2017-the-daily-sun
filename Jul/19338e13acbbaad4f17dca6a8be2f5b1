WHILE teachers take turns teaching matric pupils during the winter holidays, the woman who teaches Zulu is nowhere to be seen.This is after she was allegedly beaten up by the deputy principal on Friday in the staffroom.According to a teacher who witnessed the fight at the high school in Maphumulo, KZN, it happened after an argument about the timetable for the holiday classes.&ldquo;The teacher complained she couldn&rsquo;t get home because she was given afternoon sessions, while others who live far away got morning slots.&ldquo;The deputy principal said she felt disrespected and began hitting the teacher while others were watching,&rdquo; the witness said.The teacher allegedly fears going back to school as she doesn&rsquo;t know what will happen to her. The deputy principal has not been arrested.In a video taken by a witness, the teacher is surrounded by a few teachers who try and calm her down.She is heard saying: &ldquo;Please leave me alone. I would rather become a cleaner at this school. I would rather lose my job.&rdquo;The teacher told Daily Sun she didn&rsquo;t want to comment.The deputy principal&rsquo;s cellphone was on voicemail.KZN Education spokesman Sihle Mlotshwa said: &ldquo;We are going to ask the district to give us more information about the unfortunate incident. &ldquo;We expect adults to be able to handle differences and not resort to violence.
