HE USED to be Popeye in Zone 14 . . . but today he is a fighter for the rights of the poor! The Apartheid government used to evict us. Why is our current government doing the same thing, he wants to know. WHY IS THIS GOVERNMENT TREATING US LIKE THE APARTHEID GOVERNMENT DID? if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsvWUapH2U4aPf4ZNPvbBuyAb6lRUsPWE_FQq_U7iECZfEjgWDvi9flY2t-6hfnfP7PCWji_SIzzC5FSZUPIi-ZWH4m0RWV1ktHTCVcXJpgzd7_3q0voeP_esYRFAhx2VHA_baOOb8VlHlN3uAJrti8Ep6NNzubSqn_PVHKRYUGoazC8kQzS3XZy5fH3fKiBFhmt-FrpeQ-YyBR7sFGeeHE-EwVwUNOZV3R_nP422pDBeVuEj4bDYr5XcWcGlwCIj7X1ENX5bMbd-vXQVa4polqEN9nEKEM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzGhngRJctJIlEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

But for the last four months he has been living in Waterworks squatter camp, near Protea Glen, Soweto.On Tuesday Popeye was struck with a rubber bullet in his left leg when Red Ants demolished shacks, leaving residents destitute. While his shack was not demolished, he experienced the chaos around him.“I was heartbroken when I saw the Red Ants demolishing shacks. It seems black people are still facing the same problems they experienced during apartheid.” Kere, a scriptwriter, said he is working on a play and a short movie and that it is unrealistic to write about something you have not experienced yourself. He said he had been visiting various squatter camps to learn how the residents live and cope and was told a new township was forming in Waterworks. When he went there he was given a place to erect his own shack. “Some of these people were registered for RDPs but never got houses. They have been waiting since 1996.” He said on the day he was shot with rubber bullets, Joburg municipal officials told him he didn’t belong there. “How could they say that? People come here for many reasons. There are youngsters here. They want to start their own lives and leave the family feuds over houses behind in Soweto. “We are not foreigners. We just want a roof over our heads. The people who come here don’t qualify for bonds.” Kere said all townships began in the same way. “The government fought with land invaders but eventually it built RDPs. These people also want their own houses.“We are all South Africans. It makes no sense for the government to fight its people over unoccupied land. “We need houses, and government is failing us.”
