AWARD-WINNING house DJ and music producer, Prince Kaybee, is said to be parting ways with his manager, Given Ngwenya.&nbsp; The musician, whose real name is Kabelo Motsamai, from Senekal in Welkom, in the Free State, is said to be gatvol with Given. He is reportedly accusing him of a rip off lasting years.&nbsp; According to sources close to the two, Prince Kaybee is angry with Given of Born In Soweto Management and doesn&rsquo;t want anything to do with him any more.&nbsp; One source told Sunday Sun: &ldquo;Prince Kaybee has realised that he&rsquo;s been making money for Given all this time.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s fed up with Given getting rich at his expense, while he does all the groundwork. He&rsquo;s been complaining about this kind of exploitation for a long time. He has since called it quits. He tried to explain to the guy that it was wrong for them to rip him off like this.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another source alleged Prince Kaybee was angry after discovering the company had ripped him off almost R500&thinsp;000.&nbsp; &ldquo;That drove him insane because he trusted the management company, but they treated him like their cash cow,&rdquo; the second source said.&nbsp; Given denied that all allegations, and said: &ldquo;Whoever informed you of such is a liar. Kaybee is contracted to BIS as a composer, a recording artist and a performer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The details of the agreement between BIS and Prince Kaybee is confidential and we&rsquo;d be acting in breach if we were to disclose them.&nbsp; Prince Kaybee was not available for comment and he failed to respond to our SMSes.
