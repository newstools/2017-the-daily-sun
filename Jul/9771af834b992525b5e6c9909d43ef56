five-month-old calf believed by a villager to be the reincarnation of her dead
husband.Khim Hang (74) said up to 100 people a day visit her home
in northeast Kratie province to see the calf she said behaves very similarly to
her husband, Tol Khut, who died more than a year ago."I believe that the calf is my husband because
whatever he does...is in exactly the same way as my husband did when he was
alive," she told Reuters Television.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstTKqxnhxnYIetbthiYOE8PQskS6fTWMFu19yMBXqY74a-AqXUeYZ4-3FM1DoJn1ZByepXvd7nygvdl89TGYXFR94e71F3nQBu-KqQavX0W6IOZKzOe7ZCXQTTP0WugutS2HDl1Jqyn5IaO7NtgnNpxWDSnxqYjixH2Sxf3Ek-ZT2tkeovGOVhsydzIy6D4uGBykICpu-qX-8dDhv0PIK0zDrZTvpxnCfVyCPjRWkN1Q5xG2BXhKPV1xEEYA2AJpqSj-a_mUFNZXkL1u1D4iMQj6nXBnrZ9rx6tdw\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzNPaRJkIP9oVEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

strong following on social media."I thought it was quite unusual to see a cow go up
to the house like this," said Thach Vin (32), referring to a video she saw
on Facebook in which the calf walked up stairs into the family's one-storey
home.Â  "So I came here to see it with my own eyes,"
she said.Once inside the wooden house, the calf is fed, washed and
put to bed with a fluffy pillow once used by Tol Khut.Cambodia is 95 percent Buddhist and many believe the soul
of a person is reincarnated after death."I will keep him and take care of him for my entire
life," said Khim Hang.
