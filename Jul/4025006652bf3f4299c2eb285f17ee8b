ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said that ANC MP Makhosi Khoza has ignored their calls.Kodwa was speaking to News24, after the ANC KZN announced today that it has served Khoza with a charge sheet.He said he had tried personally and that there were also attempts by ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe, parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu and the KwaZulu-Natal ANC."We tried to reach her, but were unsuccessful. We even asked Jackson (Mthembu), because of his proximity in Parliament, to please help us. Even there, Jackson has complained that she is not willing to see him and it is difficult to see her... including the Speaker of Parliament, battling to get her confirmation about whether she accepts security arranged after her threats. Parliament is also struggling to get hold of her," Kodwa said. "The leadership of the ANC is struggling to reach her, yet we see her everywhere. Our view is that it is that conduct that worries us as the ANC." Kodwa revealed that the party had tried on numerous occasions to reach Khoza, but that she had ignored their calls.ANC Provincial secretary Super Zuma told News24 on Wednesday that they served Khoza with a formal charge sheet late on Tuesday. News24 understands that the charges relate to Khoza&rsquo;s public outcry about President Jacob Zuma to step down, and speaking out about problems in the ANC.The date for Khoza to appear before the disciplinary committee has not been revealed.Said Zuma: "I can&rsquo;t reveal the date. For now, we are not intending to debate this issue publicly because she has been formally charged. So we don&rsquo;t want to infringe on her rights."We don&rsquo;t want her to complain about her matter being dealt with publicly," he said.
