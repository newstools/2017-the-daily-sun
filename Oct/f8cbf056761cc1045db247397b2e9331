On one of my best days, I am sad. For the first time in four years, I cried. I read the comments and cried. It wasn’t the biggest gig I got, but it’s the one that made me happy,” she wrote on Twitter.She later returned to the platform to insist that she had no regrets about being in the show and slammed suggestions she was looking for attention and cashing in on her weight.“I was body positive before the money came. I was obsessed with myself before the money. "The money came because of the self-love. The fact that people believe I wake up wanting to be hated is what weakens me the most. My mother had to clean up my vomit this morning because I cried so much, my stomach turned and I got sick,” she wrote.
