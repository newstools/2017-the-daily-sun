We thought he would be the next Mashabela Galane. We encouraged him to study before pursuing a career in comedy full-time,” he said. Thabo said his brother was loved by everyone and he couldn’t understand why someone would strike him with lightning. However, sangoma Makgonatjohle Seaparo said although evil people sometimes used lightning to kill others, it sometimes just struck people naturally.
