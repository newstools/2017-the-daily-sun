They showed her documents, claiming they had come to repossess my furniture as I was behind on my payments.” Nkosana’s granddaughter, Thabi (33), said: “I was confused as the men had documents and I didn’t know what was going on.” The men took a sound system, sofas, a TV and a microwave oven from the house and drove off in their bakkie.But they were caught on CCTV. Residents said it wasn’t the first time something like this had happened in the area. Tshepo Molefe (34) said: “The residents have been reporting the bakkie for some time, but cops do not do anything.” Police spokesman Captain Aubrey Moopeloa said a case of theft was opened. “We’ve received many complaints about similar incidents involving the same people.  “Luckily, they were caught on CCTV. Now we are looking for the man who was caught on camera. Anyone with information should call the cops.”
