September between the members of the University Council’s Audit and Council
Risk committees and international KPMG representatives. The university said that the
committees deliberated “long and hard” on the matter.“The committees acknowledged that
KPMG did take some actions, including releasing the CEO, COO and a number of
senior partners to mitigate the reputational damage that it suffered as a
result of its relationship with Gupta-associated companies and its complicity
in the SARS (South African Revenue Service) report but felt that KPMG had not
gone far enough,” the statement read.According to Wits vice Chancellor
Professor Adam Habib, it was agreed that KPMG had not been sufficiently
transparent and that it is hard to reconcile KPMG’s conclusion that no one did
anything illegal. "Senior individuals have been dismissed
and the SARS report has been retracted," said  Professor Adam HabibPriceWaterhouseCoopers remains the
university’s external auditors.
