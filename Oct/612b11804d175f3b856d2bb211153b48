Cops also found machinery used in illegal mining.Springs police spokesman, Captain Johannes Ramphora, said cops rushed to the scene following a tip-off from community members.“The two suspects were found to have been running an illegal mining business for the past four years,” he said.Ramphora said cops also found explosives on the scene. He said the men were caught making their way out of the shaft at midnight.He said a case of illegal mining was opened against the two and they will appear in the Springs Magistrates Court soon.
