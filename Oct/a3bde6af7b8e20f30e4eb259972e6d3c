According to reports, he was due to be released in a few months’ time when the scandal broke.  But he is now apparently facing extra time in prison pending the outcome of an investigation into the love affair.  The prisoner had been studying law through Unisa, but his studies have been put on hold.  Correctional services spokeswoman in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West, Tshidi Mapole, told Daily Sun that the department couldn’t share information about the incident as investigations were continuing. “What we can say is that the inmate involved has been charged internally,” said Mapole.  “On the issue of his studies, I can say that his exams have been postponed to next semester.”  Singabakho Nxumalo, another correctional services spokesman, told the People’s Paper the matter had not been finalised and he couldn’t say anything about it yet.  The department has sent condolences to the family of the prison warder who committed suicide.
