Local DJ, DJ Zinhle is a #StlyeCrush for her down to earth, cool, tomboy style. DJ Zinhle, whose real name is Ntombezinhle Jiyane, is also a Yummy Mummy (another name for a Hot Mom). She has a very tomboy style but it's still trendy. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt=""></a>She loves to add femininity to outfits by pairing them with pointy heels. It's extremely rare for us to see Zinhle in a princess ball gown dress, But her style makes her relatable to the everyday girl. The kind of girl who could look to Zinhle for style inspiration should be a down to earth cool girl herself. See pictures below of Zinhle's fabulous style:READ: YOUR BROKEN HEART WILL HEAL AGAINStyled by baby girl @pearlthusi ???? | ??: @sir_brandon_reynoldsA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Sep 16, 2017 at 10:33pm PDT#ReplayXDJZinhle #TouchIt #ReplaySAA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Aug 31, 2017 at 5:51am PDTB??$$! . @samphiriphotography ????? | Hair by @sensuelle_sa | Styled by @i_ammiss_t | Makeup ??: @dreythemakeupartistA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Aug 3, 2017 at 12:26am PDTBO$$! | ??: @dreythemakeupartist!!! ????| Photography: @stillsbytomA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jul 26, 2017 at 3:57am PDTPhotography: @sipsip_tv | makeup ?? by @simphizi | hair by @sinahs_glam_hair | hair styled by @kabeloleeroyA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jul 18, 2017 at 8:25am PDT#BO$$A post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jun 29, 2017 at 6:40am PDTA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jun 25, 2017 at 2:34am PDT@pearlthusi got me wearing oversized clothes ?? | jeans ?? by @replaysouthafricaA post shared by ZINHLE JIYANE (@djzinhle) on Jun 14, 2017 at 1:15am PDTThe boss lady who supplies my HAIR has just moved to Sandton City... #Repost @sinahs_glam_hair ··· SINAH'S GLAM HAIR SANDTON CITY BRANCH IT'S OFFICIALLY OPENED: WE AT: SHOP NO: 015 LOWER FOOD COURT.
