SHE had gone out to have some fun but it turned into a nightmare when she was raped by a mute man. To add to her horror, her alleged attacker is still walking the streets. That’s allegedly because police have yet to find a sign language interpreter to read him his rights before he is arrested! The 28-year-old woman from Jakkalsdans Village in Winterveld said her nightmare started when she went to an outside toilet to relieve herself at a local tavern early in September. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssBUG-Qp5O-RWmIVENIeLyjYV4eg_TrKyLkPzPL5QNV0Tmhkz2xAkOUd7jxHIyFnwjPdT9egF9IjXcf1owwHEwef2aSV0V1CYB8iHo5EAyAFsx-IEx_FJmc4mqJS_1z5is1jQyz67x8NbWgvA6I6nRtHn85halrQJ3c0XFN1cEXyMhUi7JvdTBDbmF4GSOQnB-ELuN9WjDwPpLk2SVCz3cJkDvL7f11ZUl6FC1fVBtA0iqDg4_qr6Se1rmwAIdIaaPQxpXjLDyPl0yYsbzb1zZuwk5NhiE\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzJYPgKhEKubNEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

She said when they reached the toilet, the man started beating her. “He forced me to undress and threatened to hit me with a brick.” The man communicated with her by using sign language. “After he raped me, he started crying and apologised, but I walked out.” She said she was afraid the man might rape her again or someone else as he was still roaming the streets. “We work at the same mall. Every time I see him, he waves at me. He can see that there are no consequences for what he did and he might do it again.” North West police spokesman Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said a case of rape was opened. He didn’t say why the suspect hadn’t been arrested.
