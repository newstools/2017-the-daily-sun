MIRANDA Makoloka was transporting kids to school when she was hit by a speeding car allegedly being driven by a traffic cop.According to Miranda from Tsakane extension 1, Ekurhuleni, the cop failed to stop at a stop sign.She claimed the officer, travelling in an unmarked vehicle, bumped her Toyota Verso.“She stopped a few metres away and accused me of driving recklessly,” she said.“She was more worried about her job, house and kids than what she did to my car.”Miranda said she told the officer she was on the wrong.“When I showed her the stop sign, she apologised and went back to her car.“I thought she was coming back but she just drove off.“I gave chase on foot but the car was too fast for me.”Miranda said a passing motorist gave her a lift and they chased after the officer’s speeding Nissan Hardbody bakkie.“We managed to cut her off and took her back to the accident scene with us,” she said.She said the traffic cops who attended the scene told her she was wasting her time as the case would be swept under the carpet, and they didn’t take any statements.“They were right. Three months later, my wrecked car is still sitting at the garage and I have no source of income.”Ekurhuleni metro cops spokesman Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago advised Miranda to visit their internal affairs offices to check the progress of her complaint.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt="" /></a>
