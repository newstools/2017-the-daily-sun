EVERY night Mangaliso Khumbi would smoke a zol before he went to bed – but on Monday the habit killed him.  The 26-year-old from phase 7 kasi in Mangaung was found burned to death in a shack in the morning. Neighbours believe that his beloved dagga took his life. They said after Mangaliso smoked outside with a friend, he probably did not kill the burning zol when he went back inside, because he wanted to smoke some more.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuXO-zNhbdZPSpHTdcRlUebBMQK1c8VgxjfvIlN_TllItt7JEdRbCR0Ekyc1-crvfcGtD5jzFwb9qzPPkeJtgvT8dYx4P_8-4JodxJxr67zA4eK64Lwbv4AY5RjdhE0rC3zOHT7A_85QjCQHPdd-jQiRIDASRCKKjbDtqyIxxIdilfuUgC3xoqL9_m6mxLMWPie_9w-uPGxyMcP_2WBOdcULrMwXN4MQc66dynoJlJqcBpXobucwBRygUjOAuFkoGTmWh5QEDNGy3AKnoSfu4q8Q1Jyj2E\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIDeW3GUt2oeEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

All my furniture and clothes were burned. I don’t know what I am going to do as I do not have an income. “I gathered some of his ashes and will give it to his family.” A neighbour said he sat next to his shack smoking dagga with Mangaliso on Sunday evening. “I did not think anything would happen to him. After a while I went to my shack and he went inside, still smoking,” he said.“I did not hear anything during the night. When I woke up in the morning I was shocked to see the shack had been wiped out by fire.” Police Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi said an inquest docket had been opened.
