further investigation. " There was no evidence which linked both suspects
to the suspected cash seizures.  The two
alleged suspects sought the intervention of private lawyers to retrieve their
cash and these was granted by the Nelspruit Magistrate Court," said
Mulaudzi.Mulaundzi said It however, transpired that the money had
allegedly vanished and Captain Nkwanyama who took responsibility to safeguard
the cash gave different statements.An order was granted against the Mpumalanga Provincial
Commissioner in July this year to reimburse one of the two gentlemen to no
avail.An investigation was then initiated by the Hawks in
Mpumalanga and disappointingly it further transpired that a further R43 000
from a different case was also allegedly missing from R118 000 cash amount
seized from a suspect that was supposed to be forfeited to the state.Acting National of the Hawks Lieutenant General Matakata
has warned that the unethical actions of a few members will not be allowed to
undermine the hard work of the honest and dedicated men and women of the Hawks.
“The presence of corruption is like a cancer eating out
the very heart of the DPCI.  Individuals
who continue to undermine the efforts of others must be identified, punished
and separated from the good men and women of the Hawks."The fight against corruption must be fulsome,
total and unrelenting and hence I have ordered that the member be suspended
immediately,” she said Lieutenant General Matakata pointed out that under her
watch, it will not be business as usual and she will not hesitate to suspend
anyone to have been found to involve in any form of corruption.Meanwhile, Captain Nkwanyana appeared briefly at the
Nelspruit Magistrate Court and was released on R5000 bail. He has been barred
from entering any Hawks offices.  He is
expected in court again on October 17. He faces charges of theft and defeating
the ends of justice.
