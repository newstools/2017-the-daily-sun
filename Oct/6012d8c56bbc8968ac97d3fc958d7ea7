There are no cleaners or general workers. Teachers sweep their own classrooms.” DA shadow education MEC Khume Ramulifho said if they were better maintained, the schools could be used to reduce overcrowding elsewhere. We hold Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi responsible for ensuring that these schools receive the necessary resources.” Gauteng Education’s Steve Mabona said Meadowlands schools were built in the 1950s and over the years, there had been structural decay.“For major structural faults, we advise schools to raise the matter with the infrastructural directorate. Posts for school groundsmen are decided by the pupil-teacher ratio.”He said as Braamfischerville came into being, young parents had moved there and more schools were built.“This year, the department has handed over two schools to SGBs and Braamfischerville residents.”
