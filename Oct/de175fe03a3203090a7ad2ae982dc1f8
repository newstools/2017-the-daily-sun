Minutes later she received news of her brother’s death.She said: “The entire family is in shock. We are trying to figure out what happened, because the whole incident does not make any sense. “We are saddened they decided to kill him instead of taking whatever they wanted and sparing his life. “My brother would not even hurt a fly, but he was killed in the cruellest way possible.“We will leave everything in God’s hands and we believe the police will find the killers. They deserve to rot in jail for the rest of their lives.” Meanwhile, police have launched a huge manhunt after a murder, attempted murder and robbery that took place on Sunday night.Limpopo police spokesman Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said cops would leave no stone unturned in their hunt for those responsible.
