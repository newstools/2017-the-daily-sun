Mashilo (24) is a UJ graduate who wants to give a voice to taxi passengers. He is
tired of taxi drivers' bad driving so now he has created a mobile app that will
allow passengers to be able to complain if they are not happy with the way taxi
drivers drive.This app is
called Motor Advance Protect Passenger MAPP  will enable users to confidentially alert the
department of transport.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsv6NvBDH1T4CKKh9dkXgMX0od0U0RX13OQinwcsQP_YzI0mWrmL9OvS2mKF_9lEgI_cCoOu98hRBaCO2wDK6mHuMCDZ8bPWwo3yTVR1u8lHJT0zYf1w64plQQyZ3QbFCLC1EDwf4sdC8OkFg34rMik3b3MjvlfXyqXG1gl4w_bOUSZFtPRuEmjCMMFxiGwGEiU_4RmqdvaEAoP-Gt3OWDol_mBBt1Dfe7PvPl1-6sEObApg8ftSIrk2CwrdptmN5b_wn2OrRSSBt7jouioXSdIjdkigJzI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzMdnkBDbZQWDEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Daily Sun Lebogang said “The Idea is to solve a the national problem, taxi
drivers are responsible for millions of lives. I believe the safety of South
African citizens should not be a burden only to the government but should be a
collective effort, and this app will empower and enable citizens."He said the
app will be available on Google play and works like Whatsapp - all you need is
to download it and activate it.“The mobile
app will have two versions, the passengers version and the drivers version.It enables
the department and taxi associations monitor the speed at which the taxi is
going.It also
serves as an SOS app to report crime to the SAPS and also as a tracker.Department
of Transport spokeswoman Melita Madiba “It is very refreshing to see the youth
taking initiative to ensure peoples safety."This
will be one of the apps the department will be part of it."We
hope more youngsters will find ways to better people's lives.”
