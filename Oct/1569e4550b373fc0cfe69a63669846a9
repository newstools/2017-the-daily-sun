Two children died in hospital yesterday.Villagers camped outside after dragging the victims out and putting out the fire. The attack happened at about 9.30 on Tuesday night.It appears five victims died in the first rondavel, among them a woman aged 51 and children below the age of 15.While villagers stood at a distance as the rondavel burned, more shots rang out and another rondavel was set on fire. Four people were sleeping in that rondavel. A 58-year-old woman was apparently burned to death there. Three children were rushed to hospital.“Two of them just died,” said the shaken Sibongile.She said the motive was not yet known and it was difficult to speculate. Family members of the dead had not yet arrived from Durban and Joburg. “We are still waiting for them, so we can’t give the names of the deceased. But we know that two women and six children died,” she said.Mbuba Zondi, Ward 13 councillor from Umvoti Local Municipality, said their safety was at risk.“People should not be able to do such a thing without fear,” he said.KZN police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed the incidents and said: “The motive is not yet known and no arrest has been made.”
