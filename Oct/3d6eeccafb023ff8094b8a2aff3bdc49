KENYAâ€™S repeat presidential elections will be held tomorrow
as planned, as tensions mount across the country.The electoral board's statement came as the Supreme Court
said today it could not hear a last-minute petition to postpone the elections
because it didn't have a quorum of judges. The shooting of one judge's driver
the evening before the hearing raised fears about intimidation of the
judiciary.Supreme Court Chief Justice David Maraga appeared alone
in the courtroom and said only he and one other judge had shown up for the
hearing.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstrF-f3k8OVpo8ZlDkMNEj1nvW4WJse55v00afaBiWV9H2NvF3GPEfl_1Vf_BpHGTBO--VIOuu_0NUIXUCcaOqvyZNKto1cIOzreUfWUSWuUWbZoCg2TibZ6ajVwQwoU8Vztp3usPiG21DCOzZTkF5nD_-RFWbnVUb6ewMTzvwT6Rqi3O4yCQZR1vWRDmY775p5dDY7ZJol3qtGeljqhUtsdJeTCzer7jhv_z4ktzcuU-VcKcBNDkTcHCe6BE8I14mWXlPwk02e-bhlcwCZzPPscHWzOcdA_9UDFg\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIHccpihMm50EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

gathered to call for peace amid rising uncertainty and fears of violence.
Jubilant supporters of President Uhuru Kenyatta celebrated the news that the
elections will proceed, while elsewhere in Nairobi supporters of opposition
leader Raila Odinga gathered.The Supreme Court was to hear a petition filed by three
Kenyans, including a human rights activist, who urged the court to postpone
Thursday's election, arguing that electoral officials have said they cannot
ensure the polls will be free, fair and credible.Harun Ndubi, a lawyer for the petitioners, suggested that
some judges who did not attend the hearing may have violated their
constitutional duties."The justices must forever be available," said
Ndubi, though he acknowledged that the deputy chief justice whose police driver
was injured in a shooting Tuesday evening may have been genuinely troubled."For the others, I don't buy their
explanation," he said. "I don't see a credible or legitimate election
happening tomorrow," Ndubi said, adding that the vote, if it occurs
Thursday, "would be a farce".The Supreme Court court shocked Kenya last month when it
nullified President Kenyatta's August re-election, citing irregularities and
illegalities and the electoral commission's unwillingness to let court-appointed
technicians scrutinise its computer system. Opposition leader Odinga had
challenged Kenyatta's victory, claiming hackers had infiltrated the computer
servers and manipulated the vote.Odinga has said he will boycott the new election because
the electoral commission has not been reformed. Kenyatta has insisted the
Thursday vote will continue.
