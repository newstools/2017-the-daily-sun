RESIDENTS of Salvokop squatter camp in Tshwane had to brave the cold to salvage what was left of their homes.One person died and hundreds were left homeless after a fire destroyed 50 shacks on Saturday.Residents claim the fire was started by thugs who were trying to cover up their crime.Lenda Mthombeni (32), a resident, said she heard people arguing in the early hours of the morning before the fire started.She said when the voices got louder, she peeped through her window and saw a group of men fighting with her neighbour.“They had their faces covered so I couldn’t identify them.”Lenda said after several hours, she heard the residents shouting for help.When she and members of the community went to investigate, they discovered his shack was on fire.“He was still in the shack when it went up in flames.”The fire soon spread to the other shacks in the squatter camp.Lenda said efforts to stop the fire proved fruitless because their community doesn’t have running water.She said some residents’ belongings, including clothes, blankets and identity documents, were reduced to ashes.Members of the community said they are relying on the government for help until they can rebuild their homes.Councillor Fortune Mampuru said tents and blankets have been given to the residents to keep them warm for the time being.Mampuru said he was still trying to get more help for those affected by the fire.Police spokeswoman Captain Augustinah Selepe said police are investigating a case of arson and have also opened an inquest docket into the matter.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt="" /></a>
