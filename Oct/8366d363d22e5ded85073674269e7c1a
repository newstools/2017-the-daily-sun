Cramming causes stress which causes you to worry instead of studying.You have to give your brain breaks and rest to absorb the material.Review plans Check your study schedule and see if it still works for you. Do you need to change your study times or are you comfortable with it as is? Do not cut out your breaks, relaxing and exercising – they’re still important!Remember your goalsHave you achieved all your study goals by their dates? Make sure you are on track and rearrange some study time to play catch up if you need to.Summarise your work in your own words Writing summaries of what you read is better for your memory than simply reading. Lists, mind maps and flow charts are all reliable study aids.Short study sessionsStick to 30-minute study sessions, then take a break. Short, intense study sessions are better than ones that go on for hours. Study in quiet places Quiet places are the best. Libraries and classrooms after school. If you cannot find a quiet place to study, ear plugs from the chemist will help too.Eliminate distractions Don’t listen to music with heavy rhythm, bass and lyrics. Put your phone away, mute notifications or uninstall social network apps. Your phone is useful because you can set lots of custom alarms and search for information on the internet, but you must use it wisely. Drink waterStudies have proven that even mild dehydration can impair brain function, so drink lots of water while studying and before you write exams to make sure that your brain works its best. Get enough sleepYou cannot concentrate if you are tired. Sleep plays an important role in memory, both before and after learning. Rely on your study buddyThe joys of a study buddy means sharing notes, questions and quizzes, and bonding. They also can calm you down if you get stressed. This is the last lap before you both start.Don’t panic! In the worst case that you don’t do so well in the finals, you can always mark up your results.
