Captain Andre Beetge said the abducted toddler was found at about 12pm in Uitenhage and a 35-year-old suspect was arrested. He said the rescue came after an extensive search for the suspect, who took the child from his home on Saturday at about 1pm.  “Cops mobilised all their resources and specialist units, including the police helicopter, in the search. “The breakthrough came after close interaction with the taxi drivers and structures in the search. “The suspect and the missing boy were taken to Uitenhage Police Station by a taxi driver who did not wish to give his name.  “The suspect was arrested and the boy was reunited with his father and the rest of his family.” Motherwell station commander Brigadier Ernie Neveling thanked taxi drivers for their assistance. He said: “The taxi drivers were instrumental in the speedy finding of the missing boy and the suspect. “Police and community partnerships can only be made stronger with successes like these.”
