It is for this reason amongst many others that he met with AgriSA to listen to concerns and to assist in finding solutions, said Mbalula spokesman Vuyo Mhaga.He warned against blocking of roads using trucks and trackers as some media alert circulations suggested.He said the SAPS will ensure the protests happen within the rule of law and will not tolerate lawlessness and any persons who engage in conduct outside the perimeters of law will face consequences of their actions.
