ALEX Maseko (29) and his younger sister lived with their dad in their shack in KwaThema, Ekurhuleni from 1996.When their dad died in 2004, the siblings stayed in the shack and in 2009 they applied for an RDP using his name, which was built that same year.But last Thursday, an unexpected visitor brought their lives to a halt when he told them to get out, claiming he had bought the house from their father.A shocked Alex didn’t know it was possible to buy from the dead.He told Daily Sun: “My father died many years ago. There was no house at the time but only a shack.“The man told us he bought the house three weeks ago from an estate agent.“We don’t know how he could have done that as we have our father’s ID and the title deed to the house,” he said.Alex and his younger sister have since moved into the back rooms while Alex goes up and down trying to get answers.“Our father was a responsible person and loved us. He became sick and died after a long illness.“While still alive, he used to tell our relatives that the RDP that would be built belonged to his two kids.“The buyer has to explain to us how he bought the house and from whom.”Daily Sun spoke to the buyer, Baba Dlamini, who said he had bought the house from an estate agent for R150 000.The People’s Paper then spoke to the alleged estate agent, who said he followed all the legal steps and sold the house three weeks ago.But he refused to say who the seller was, or which estate agent had represented them.Mashoeshoe Attorneys said: “It is important to get lawyers to transfer a property to the children when the owner of a house dies.“Doing that makes it difficult for unscrupulous people to sell their houses.”He advised Alex to visit a lawyer and transfer the house either into him name or that of his younger sister.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");<a href="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" target="_blank"><img src="https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=0&sz=1&c=234" border="0" alt="" /></a>
