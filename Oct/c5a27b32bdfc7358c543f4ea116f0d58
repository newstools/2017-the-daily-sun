A METRORAIL train driver has been hailed as a hero after he was stabbed while rescuing four women from armed robbers on Tuesday morning.Francois Gouws, 54, was stabbed twice in his left hand by several armed robbers who made their way onto the train between Durban and Berea stations in KwaZulu-Natal.He acted swiftly when he realised commuters were under attack by several robbers who had taken advantage of the opportunity to board the train when it stopped at a red signal.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuQVA9S4N2XsJEpzW2aU0AzOuq_kYU-Rgx8gS5OHD11MY9Zj8xPKZGp4vGyUFng7AeqjPCRt3y17GjILQbI4hZA4VpfmiKwfSzeNwmBSvIA8k0EmNeGwOVOMyUm7owyy1mpyJGPTkuNOYQ326y4IveOVG6DN3Pj9fq5FfhXhrSC2fOE4wuSjffGfbOWdJ8OdiMGe9cld-fs2vx6tTstaGeEaiZPPs6qLen8hovPhfHx8pJxqjhyEqO8gob9f8h05AKBdi3QX4A-W_buTbash1A0ggCX3YA\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzC9Hoj3PsA6OEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

We always know it is dangerous and these incidents happen, but nothing can prepare you for the feeling you get when it happens to you," Gouws told a union representative.Sonja Carstens of UNTU said the incident could have been avoided if there was more security provided. She said robbers frequently jump onto trains and rob passengers.Carstens said Metrorail intended to build a wall costing R68m, but this would not stop criminals."They will break through that wall. What we need is something similar to what Bombela has done, where they have concrete fences and security patrols. When (Gouws) was attacked there was no security in sight," she said, adding that the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) had to protect its employees and commuters.Carstens said in a statement that UNTU had initiated legal action against Prasa, which in turn said the responsibility to protect workers was the police's.Carstens said Gouws was still in hospital undergoing X-ray examinations to determine if doctors needed to operate on his left hand, as there was a fear some of his nerves might have been damaged.
