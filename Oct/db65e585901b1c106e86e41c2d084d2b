Nosipho Matshayana (37) said the Western Cape government was aware of the situation. “There was a report done some years ago which found these drains were designed for the ’90s and would need to be changed as the population grows. That has never happened. Two hours of rain can cause flooding. That’s how bad the situation is,” said Matshayana. Lwandle was laid out in 1958 to accommodate single male workers. Before then, the area where Lwandle is located was a farm owned by CPJ van Vuuren. It was sold to the Stellenbosch Council in 1956 because the land was no longer profitable. Resident Babalwa Sophitsho (45) said: “Planning is important. Our government has specialists who can determine if the population will grow and by how much. That should have been done here.” Mayoral committee member for the area, Anda Ntsodo, said the blockages are caused by people who discard waste material. “Residents can report this via the call centre on 0860 103 089, notify their local ward councillor or visit their local municipal office.” The flooding in Michael and Ziwane Streets was not reported. City staff working in Nomzamo reported the blockage in Lonja Street. The team is currently clearing the blocked drain there and investigating all drains in Ziwane Street.
