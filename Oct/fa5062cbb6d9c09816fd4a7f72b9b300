FEWER than 24 hours after a teenager was shot and killed and two others injured by a man who shot at a group of protesters, some community members took to the streets again to barricade Lichtenburg's main road while they waited for the mayor to address them.By Wednesday afternoon, burning tyres, rocks and tree branches lay across Dr Nelson Mandela Avenue in Lichtenburg, North West.Earlier in the day protesters stoned cars passing the area while a few others sat on the side of the road.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstycfhQl5cDN-BVwkDicZSXeLMcqkZtbjuhowAMXFR5buju3knxIjeARYAKqtcFNgiHXyX4lDZ6dTQW72MJQo9GjCzBXIqst6aA6Rgyy987tgyIdOpyZr0SeDDAeU2Qp7rNFLFg9TQwLpVHnGvAYbfksCFet323QLHRiFkDWgtuIlU8aYtaIy6vFqS7AwaX-JIlWfEj6cnJJ7cxd3Ex1M4ZrUOytHc6KA431N5LryrkS7Ef5PtTucpNrZ1MUiDLbCSbu4a4u-vtLSby3q_BzMugTldcvUI\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzLuzfOAG7s9JEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

I signed up for one in 2007," Sedumedi said.He said he had been living in the small town for almost 17 years.Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said the man who fired at protesters handed himself over at around 10pm on Tuesday evening.Many of the shops and businesses in the town's main road were closed on Wednesday.According to Sedumedi, most businesses shut their doors on Tuesday as the protest began to build up.
