Through the exhibition we intend to connect stokvels and offer great information and services,” he said. “We want to make them more economically viable in the ever changing global environment.”There was also a workshop which gave stokvels the opportunity to engage with other service providers. Members were advised on saving and using their money. Elizabeth Segwapa (55), chairwoman of the Sister Bettina Women’s Dance Club, said she had learned a number of important things. She said: “We now know how to use and save our money. We are going to use this information.”
