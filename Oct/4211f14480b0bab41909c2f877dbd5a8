Some men pissed into the cups they were drinking from  as they were too drunk to walk to the toilets.“Some women couldn’t even stand or walk after the game,” he said.The Soweto derby attracts thousands of people from across Mzansi. Most of them go to the stadium to celebrate and have fun with their friends.Clara Monnakgotla from the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency said: “People who take alcohol should be responsible in what they do, especially in public places.”Cultural expert Refiloe wa gaKhunou said it’s shameful to see how people behaved at the stadium. “What example are they setting for the young people in the communities they come from?” he asked.“Their embarrassing behaviour will ruin their humanity and the lives of their children.”
