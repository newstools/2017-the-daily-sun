If the department insists on bringing in the new principal to the school, it will remain closed,” she said.KZN education spokesman Kwazi Mthethwa told the People’s Paper that the recruitment process should be left to the human resources unit. He said the department won’t tolerate chaos. “If those people want to engage the department, they are more than welcome to approach the district director,” he said. “Violence will not solve problems.”
