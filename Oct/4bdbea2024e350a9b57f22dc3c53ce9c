taken everything from me, my husband was a very caring and humble man who would
never even hurt a fly. We have two kids I don’t even know what to tell my
children when they ask me what happened to their father."The
kids have been traumatized by this and have to go for counseling.”The men
accused of killing Nyembe appeared in Nigel Magistrate's court for bail
application on Wednesday.Their bail
hearing has been postponed to October 19.Nyembe’s
family and friends picketed outside the court holding placards calling for no
bail against the accused.  Nyembe was
shot and killed in his office in Duduza, Gauteng.A witness
said: “Three men entered the school and demanded to see the deputy principal. “One man
told the deputy’s assistant that they had an appointment with him.“They went
to call the deputy and came back with him.“After an
exchange of a few words, the man took out a gun and shot the deputy without
warning.“He was
shot four times and collapsed.”The
circumstances and motive surrounding the incident were not immediately clear.Gauteng MEC
Panyaza Lesufi said the shooting has raised concerns about the number of people
being killed at schools.
