A BLIND commuter and three people confined to wheelchairs are in shock after one of Cape Town’s Dial-a-Ride vehicles was attacked in the Belhar region, a city official said on Tuesday.The vehicle was attacked by a mob on the corner of Symphony Way and Stellenbosch Arterial at about 6pm on Monday, said transport mayoral committee member Brett Herron.Blikkiesdorp protesters had gathered at Symphony Way at the time, forcing the closure of the road in both directions between Hindle and Stellenbosch Arterial. It was reopened about an hour later.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjss0thqvCzjd7uSE6XfLbvXeg2eHuUb1wjrdn3E5xq45CXxSo5CY44VLybqx6HShpuuv_ie8NDxtC-OA_PCsPKKubm9dUwQDbABh-RDmNEA-z8758oFpXMwLd6WW0aHWFyfNve9ee4M1dPlDDKHAR0MoMKmV80q_oKN6ZRbaRVH5Sx69eeYrkHtLgMLb5O-9PpRxT8vPXN-sRQHeb7xpzSytkuWIjO9tZyAswwaMxmVgtPslq6bccnNzvIC9lV9muO7jwtdJVnpyCqU22cWTo1D-O-6tHgc\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzCa9yPZRUfrEEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

Inside, four commuters with special needs were sitting strapped in their seats with nowhere to go,” said Herron.The commuters made use of the contracted service provided by the city as they could not use conventional public transport.The driver contacted police and ambulance services."I am shocked and horrified by this attack. I cannot begin to imagine the fear these commuters must have felt while being attacked," Herron said.The vehicle was attacked on both sides, with at least three windows being smashed and three tyres burst, said Herron.One of the passengers was admitted to hospital and discharged early on Tuesday morning.“It goes without saying that the passengers and the driver are all traumatised and shocked.”Herron said continued attacks on public transport had reached a crisis point.He mentioned a Golden Arrow bus that was attacked and torched in the same area on Monday night, and two men who boarded a Golden Arrow bus in Lansdowne at the weekend and robbed passengers.Western Cape police are still trying to get information on the Dial-A-Ride attack.Herron urged anyone with information on transport attacks to contact their nearest police station or report vandalism and other important information to the city’s transport information centre on 0800 65 64 63.
