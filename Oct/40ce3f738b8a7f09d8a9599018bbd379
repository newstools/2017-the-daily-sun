The helper was not injured. Patel will remain in police custody until his next appearance on 11 October, when he was expected to submit a formal bail application. Outside court, his lawyer Tumi Mokoena said his client was innocent, and vowed to fight for him to be released on bail. Patel runs a family business which he co-owned with his late father, 54-year-old Feroz Patel, who was shot and killed in August 2016 while driving. Police spokeswoman at the time Colonel Ronel Otto said Feroz was being chased by two vehicles and subsequently lost control of his vehicle and crashed. He was then shot dead and a bag was stolen out of his vehicle. Otto said it was not clear what was in the bag.Feroz's death came more than a year after his daughter-in-law, Fatima, was found dead at her and Rameez's rented flat in Nirvana.Patel was arrested a few days after her body was discovered and he was charged with her murder.He has, however, denied killing her.The court previously heard that Fatima suffered multiple brutal wounds and a fractured skull. State pathologist Dr Arnold Mamashela told the Limpopo High Court during trial proceedings that a gunshot wound to Fatima's head probably ultimately caused her death.The court also heard that Rameez Patel was covered in his wife's blood and had bathed and changed into Muslim regalia after the shooting.The couple had three children together, the youngest just four months old at the time of the murder.The 32-year-old Rameez was out on bail of R250 000 bail.Immediately after his short appearance, Patel was driven to Limpopo High Court to stand trial for Fatima's murder.During that appearance Mokoena applied for a postponement, saying the more recent arrest had made it difficult for him to consult his client.Â Patel will appear again on Tuesday for his trial for his wife's alleged murder.
