WESTERN Cape Community Safety MEC Dan Plato has questioned why the SANDF is being deployed to high-crime communities only after a predominantly black neighbourhood was attacked.Speaking during a provincial after-school awareness session in Philippi East, Plato said Police Minister Fikile Mbalula had ignored the wave of crime on the Cape Flats while it was taking place in coloured communities."If I must say, when the coloured community or other communities were hit in the same manner, he did nothing ... and now it is the township communities. What I must read into that, I do not know," he said.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");(function(){var d=this;window.rumTick=function(c){var b=window;var a=b;a=void 0===a?d:a;if(a=(a=a.performance)&&a.now?a.now():null)c={label:c,type:4,value:a},b=b.google_js_reporting_queue=b.google_js_reporting_queue||[],1024>b.length&&b.push(c)};}).call(this);window.rumTick&&rumTick('fb');var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjstaenJpkUqyeSz6CI9_BKVEPK6gbp6mUh_Ihn4eGqW8WFMOVp-7QE6AIIAvmWJI26EZ3cmnx0KBwu90hsRPiZNCW_rduDMJoJ_ajJsQkRLG99OnyJSrwZ5RbozBYQeNRk3yOEp4WJIhUinvtNXqlc1aYgloYtTCXnbti5bnJdBsgl6DyBmwxU3YWLyML1mPzb8pvFu3j8ZvcIbiDUxBOG1Vs8zW1J2Xnx9SZ0ZfT9pMVMPCGS-n0R70DF5C2wmK6nYOX8jqSvh3H_2gEQE_T6ZtJFdsT3c\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzO8a2WGItryGEAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

(Mbalula) needs to spell it out. What is it they are going to do when the gangsters begin to shoot at them?" Plato welcomed the appointment of Colonel Bongani Mtakati as the new station commander of Philippi East Police Station."Many of the problems at many police stations are managerial. It's a leadership problem and I just hope he will bring the necessary change."Mbalula appointed Mtakati after he visited Marikana in the wake of the deadly shootings.The former commander, Colonel Vuyisile Payi, was not suspected of wrongdoing, but a drastic change was needed to restore trust, Mbalula said.
