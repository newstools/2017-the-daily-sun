HAVE you ever been robbed and then turned around and thanked thugs for being kind?That was me yesterday in downtown Joburg. One minute I was listening to Scars To Your Beautiful by Alessia Carla. if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjsuoSDKd3-aByqn0xFfDuwIBIacLPrwHBJFeLbFT3egxswZmyiOAP-EMrox17Z1o3yywkMrD1SfgV3P81Yl-IdajBEAajTzFr1ZOF4IwnN7OoipmYMY5dnu_jdkblDo4EW5BEVg6VnI8BeX-9oCfU3ExpTQDQaq675JWkQJfmUobaPxTtoAZ7Ql9PBNR8eF5nWy0m5BIuVw8hel3LP86UdjsOCcPLWEeCfzZCloYniETbyO_u9ibPpP1vGbhproiMHYLFhFQ2mBsvvu5Cx97qGemHpYJ0dM\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzIyD6RVkzQg-EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

As I watched the two guys approach, I sensed danger and put away my cellphone. One started talking to me about needing money to go home and I fell for it. I took out some coins. But he told me it wasn’t enough. It dawned on me that I was being robbed! The angry thug demanded more money. He threatened and tried to search me. We got into an argument and that is when he lifted up his sleeve and showed me a knife. “I won’t hesitate to slit your throat with it,’’ he threatened. I immediately volunteered the R60 I had on me. But he took R50 and told me to keep the rest. I was left holding R10. Then out of the blue, his friend came back. He had a serious look on his face. Instead of robbing me of more as I’d expected, he gave me back the R7 in coins that I’d first given to his friend. He went on to apologise: “Go buy a cigarette.”I am lucky I escaped with my belongings and my precious life and thank God for sparing me.
