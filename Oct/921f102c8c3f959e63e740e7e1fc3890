THE MOERANE Commission is heading for the troubled Harry Gwala district in KwaZulu-Natal. But investigations to find out what is behind the slaughter of politicians in the province seem to be uncovering more questions than answers.if(typeof za24_DisplayAd != "undefined") za24_DisplayAd("300x250","2");var viewReq = new Array();function vu(u) {var i=new Image();i.src=u.replace("&amp;","&");viewReq.push(i);}vu("https://securepubads.g.doubleclick.net/pcs/view?xai\x3dAKAOjssSubO3nEljwdjSpCrWNQnjb3muiInJP3utXhiOwVMOHZzGVvrjq5YwIuCXCcu2kzQAfiauYEOTFtx8cF3KmXm8RX38AczMqOU0ifMO8oP8Qtfg-oZWJ_aHamBwnp9xOIs7mwxvcIUf7CoyMlFh02whs_FsoxIQhA-WrqVQlFCj3-DgvdD19yJvqt-lWf67J_VcI-FIijAWlF_nVVwnbPdXYM7S3T1xGVbVFFGBfFIrVNwvHu_JlKXHGOseVovr9gv_Ep4Q3eZSNjmNMKlTRczYF2S6vpY\x26sig\x3dCg0ArKJSzHEmpwwxj1O9EAE\x26urlfix\x3d1\x26adurl\x3d")

At this stage it is unconfirmed, but many people believe his killing was politically motivated.“This has to be investigated thoroughly to find out if there is an element of politics involved,” said a councillor.ANC provincial spokesman, Mdumiseni Ntuli, said speculation that there were political elements involved in the incident were unproven.“So far there is nothing we have heard or seen that links his murder to politics. He served in the lower structures of the party and has been on good terms with the leaders of the branch he used to lead,” said Ntuli.“We cannot entirely dismiss the allegation at this point but hopefully the investigation will reveal the truth.”Municipal spokesman Skhumbuzo Sethuntsa said: “Speculation at this stage is quite misleading. The motive for his killing is not known.”Sethuntsa called on police to bring those behind Nkosinathi’s killing to book.“The dead man was a willing worker, dedicated to his job, and his presence will certainly be missed.”Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Municipality is close to Umzimkhulu, where former ANC Youth League general secretary and ANC Councillor Sindiso Magaqa was shot on 13 July. He later died in hospital.At the funeral service for Magaqa, his friends Less Stuta and Thabiso Zulu made shocking claims of alleged corruption and bloody competition for positions in Umzimkhulu and the district.Stuta and Zulu will testify before the commission.Ngcobo’s murder is the fifth in Harry Gwala district in the space of a year.Other councillors and Umzimkhulu office-bearers killed earlier this year were Khaya Thobela, on 20 April, Khaya Mgcwaba 11 May and Mduduzi Tshibase, who was killed on 2 June.Solo Mdledle, secretary of the commission, told Daily Sun that due to killings associated with politics that have taken place in the Harry Gwala area, they will have the sitting there.
