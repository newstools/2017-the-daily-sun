Morris told Daily Sun: “I mean, a wedding day is a very special day to be remembered. In this case, we just wanted to be unique and do things our way. “Choosing the Caterpillar ganda ganda and riding on it was very nice. “I just wish we could do it again!” The two decided on the bulldozer because Morris first met Mahlatsi in 2014 when he was contracted to a construction company where she was working. Every second day Morris went there to deliver equipment and parts for heavy duty vehicles. That’s where their love blossomed and they have been inseparable ever since. Their wedding started with a celebration in Zebediela, Limpopo and ended on Sunday in Lebotlwane Village. Guests at the wedding said they wished they could also get married on a ganda ganda, like the happy couple.Mahlatsi said at first she was a bit afraid to get on to the vehicle. “When the ganda ganda picked us up from the ground for the first time, I was worried but I was sitting next to my husband and I knew I had nothing to be scared of.” “Everyone knows this thing does hard labour like digging roads but I never thought it could be this romantic.”Mahlatsi said riding on the ganda ganda was the best feeling in the world. “The ride was priceless and amazing. I want to thank everyone who made this idea a reality. “The guests were also very happy to see us and they took pictures left, right and centre. “I could not have asked for a better wedding.”
